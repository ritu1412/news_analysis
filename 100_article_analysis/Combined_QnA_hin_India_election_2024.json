        "body": "नई दिल्ली:\n\nलोकसभा चुनाव 2024 के नतीजे सामने आने के बाद एनडीए और इंडिया दोनों ही गठबंधनों में खुशी देखी जा रही है. बीजेपी को स्पष्ट बहुमत नहीं मिला है, लेकिन एनडीए के तीसरी बार सत्ता में वापसी को लेकर वो बेहद उत्साहित हैं. वहीं इंडिया गठबंधन ने विपक्ष के तौर पर ही सही, मजबूत वापसी की है, उनकी सीटों की संख्या और मनोबल दोनों बढ़े हैं. दोनों ही अलायंस में सीटों की संख्या का अंतर बेहद कम हुआ है. नतीजे आने के अगले ही दिन दोनों ही पक्षों ने आगे की रणनीति को लेकर महत्वपूर्ण बैठक आयोजित की है.\n\nविपक्षी दल शाम को 6 बजे से बैठक कर रहे हैं. इंडिया ब्लॉक के ज्यादातर नेता पहले से ही दिल्ली में हैं. इस बैठक में आगे का एजेंडा और सरकार गठन की संभावनाओं को तलाशने पर विचार किया जाएगा.इधर बीजेपी के नेतृत्व वाले एनडीए भी चुनाव परिणामों की समीक्षा करने, सरकार गठन को लेकर चर्चा करने और समझौतों पर सहमति बनाने को लेकर व्यस्त है. सूत्रों ने बताया है कि नरेंद्र मोदी जिन्होंने आज औपचारिक रूप से प्रधानमंत्री पद से इस्तीफा दे दिया है, शनिवार को ऐतिहासिक तीसरे कार्यकाल के लिए शपथ लेंगे.तेलुगु देशम पार्टी प्रमुख चंद्रबाबू नायडू और जेडीयू अध्यक्ष नीतीश कुमार सहित तमाम एनडीए दलों ने अपना समर्थन पत्र दे दिया है.सूत्रों ने एनडीटीवी को बताया कि तेलुगु देशम पार्टी के प्रमुख चंद्रबाबू नायडू ने भाजपा के साथ लोकसभा अध्यक्ष की सीट और हर तीन सांसदों पर एक मंत्री पद का मांग की है.वहीं बिहार के मुख्यमंत्री नीतीश कुमार ने भी अपनी पार्टी के लिए कई मांगें रखी हैं. 2019 में तब बीजेपी ने एक से अधिक मंत्री पद देने की मांग ठुकरा दी थी, वो अपने राज्य के लिए विशेष दर्जा भी चाहते थे, लेकिन इस बार परिस्थिति बदल गई है.भाजपा बहुमत के आंकड़े से काफी पीछे रह गई है, ऐसे में उसके सामने गठबंधन के साथ आगे बढ़ने का ही एकमात्र रास्ता है. हालांकि, सवाल उठ रहे हैं कि क्या 2014 से अपने दम पर फैसले लेने की आदी भाजपा सहयोगियों के साथ मिलकर काम कर पाएगी.हालांकि, बीजेपी को समर्थन पत्र सौंपने के बाद से इंडिया गठबंधन को निराशा जरूर हुई है. नीतीश कुमार और चंद्रबाबू नायडू दोनों ही पहले विपक्ष का हिस्सा रहे हैं और अब एनडीए का हिस्सा हैं.नीतीश कुमार ने चार महीने पहले ही विपक्षी इंडिया गठबंधन को बनाने में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाई थी, लेकिन फिर कुछ बातों से खफा होकर उन्होंने फिर पाला बदल लिया. नायडू, भी पिछले आम चुनाव से पहले एनडीए छोड़कर विपक्ष का हिस्सा बन गए थे, लेकिन इस साल फरवरी में उन्होंने भी यू-टर्न ले लिया.कांग्रेस के वरिष्ठ नेता जयराम रमेश ने चुटकी लेते एक्स पर एक वीडियो पोस्ट किया, जिसमें चंद्रबाबू नायडू को बीजेपी की आलोचना करते हुए देखा जा सकता है. एनडीटीवी को दिए एक इंटरव्यू में उन्हें ये कहते हुए सुना गया, \"सभी नेता नरेंद्र मोदी से बेहतर हैं.\" भाजपा ने इस बार 240 सीटें जीती हैं, वहीं एनडीए के सहयोगी दलों के साथ ये आंकड़ा बढ़कर 293 पहुंच गया है. इसमें 28 सीटें नायडू और नीतीश कुमार की पार्टी के भी हैं. वहीं इंडिया ब्लॉक के पास 232 सीटें हैं, जिनमें से अकेले 99 कांग्रेस ने जाती हैं.\n\nपूरी स्टोरी पढ़ें\n\nNDTV.in पर ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों को ट्रैक करें, व देश के कोने-कोने से और दुनियाभर से न्यूज़ अपडेट पाएं\n\nफॉलो करे:\n\nLok Sabha Election Result 2024, NDA Meeting, PM Modi, INDIA Alliance",

        "body": "ICC T20 World Cup 2024 India vs Ireland: रोहि्त शर्मा ने आयरलैंड के खिलाफ मैच से पहले पिच को लेकर तोड़ी चुप्पी\n\nभारतीय टीम जब बुधवार को आयरलैंड के खिलाफ अपने आईसीसी टी20 विश्व कप अभियान की शुरुआत करेगी तो सभी की नजरें नासाउ काउंटी इंटरनेशनल स्टेडियम की पिच पर होंगी. टी20 विश्व कप 2024 की शुरुआत से ही न्यूयॉर्क की पिच सवालों के घेरे में है. पहली बार अमेरिका में हो रहे आईसीसी टूर्नामेंट के लिए ड्रॉप इन पिचों का इस्तेमाल हो रहा है. न्यूयॉर्क की पिच पर असमान उछाल ने बल्लेबाजी को मुश्किल बना दिया है. बड़ी बाउंड्री के साथ साथ पिच से तेज गेंदबाजों को मदद मिल रही है, जिससे हाई स्कोरिंग मुकाबला नहीं हो पा रहा है. इस पिच पर सोमवार को दक्षिण अफ्रीका और श्रीलंका के बीच खेला गया था. उस मैच में पिच चौंकाने वाली साबित हुई क्योंकि श्रीलंका की टीम 19.1 ओवर में 77 रन पर आउट हो गई. हालांकि, अंत में दक्षिण अफ्रीका ने मैच जीत लिया, लेकिन पिच की वजह से लक्ष्य का पीछा करना मुश्किल हो गया था. दक्षिण अफ्रीका को 78 रनों के लक्ष्य को हासिल करने के लिए 16.2 ओवर तक संघर्ष करना पड़ा था. बता दें, भारत ने पिछले हफ्ते इसी स्थान पर बांग्लादेश के खिलाफ अपना अभ्यास मैच खेला था, जबकि टीम इंडिया के चार में से तीन ग्रुप मुकाबले भी इसी मैदान पर होंगे.\n\nवहीं आयरलैंड के खिलाफ मुकाबले से पहले भारतीय कप्तान रोहित शर्मा ने नासाउ काउंटी की पिच को लेकर अपनी बात कही है. रोहित शर्मा ने कहा है कि उन्हें यकीन नहीं है कि न्यूयॉर्क में उनके खेल के लिए कौन सी पिच का इस्तेमाल किया जाएगा. प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस में रोहित शर्मा ने कहा,\"वहां चार पिचों का एक वर्ग है. मुझे नहीं पता कि हम किस विकेट पर खेलेंगे. तो, कौन जानता है - जिस विकेट पर हम कल खेल रहे हैं वह बल्लेबाजी के लिए एक अच्छा विकेट हो सकता है. तो, यह सब कुछ परिस्थितियों में खुद को ढालने के बारे में हैं.\"\n\nरोहित ने आगे कहा कि हालांकि उन्होंने दक्षिण अफ्रीका और श्रीलंका के बीच मैच नहीं देखा, लेकिन अगर हालात समान रहे तो भारतीय खिलाड़ी परिस्थितियों में खुद को ढालने की पूरी कोशिश करेंगे. रोहित शर्मा ने कहा,\"मुझे खेल देखने का मौका नहीं मिला. मैं अपने परिवार के साथ थोड़ा व्यस्त था जो कल आया था. लेकिन नहीं, निश्चित रूप से मुझे पता है कि पिच कैसी थी, अपने अन्य साथियों से सुन रहा हूं, और हमारी टीम में बहुत सारे लोग हैं और सहयोगी स्टाफ इस बारे में बात कर रहे थे कि उस खेल में क्या हुआ था. लेकिन, फिर से, मैं बस इतना कह सकता हूं कि हम इन परिस्थितियों के लिए सर्वोत्तम संभव निर्णय लेंगे, चाहे हमें जो भी सर्वोत्तम स्तर का अनुभव हो. हम बस मैदान पर जाएंगे और पिच देखेंगे.\"\n\nरोहित ने यह भी कहा कि इस नए स्टेडियम में आउटफील्ड भी चिंता का विषय है. रोहित शर्मा ने कहा,\"निश्चित रूप से, आउटफील्ड और पिच कैसे खेलेगी, इसके संदर्भ में बहुत सी चीजें बहुत अनिश्चित हैं. जैसा कि मैंने अभी कहा, यह सब उस स्थिति को तेजी से अपनाने और अभ्यस्त होने के बारे में है, क्योंकि आपके पास बहुत अधिक समय नहीं है. और अगर पिच अच्छा खेलती है, तो हम निश्चित रूप से जानते हैं कि अच्छा खेल रही पिचों पर क्या करना है. जब पिच थोड़ा सा काम कर रही होती है, तो हमें पता होता है कि बल्लेबाजी समूह के रूप में हमें क्या करने की जरूरत है. और साथ ही, गेंदबाजी समूह भी. यह सिर्फ बल्लेबाजी के बारे में नहीं है. जब आपके पास ऐसी पिच होती है, जो गेंदबाजों के लिए थोड़ी मददगार होती है, तो गेंदबाजों की भी महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका होती है.\"\n\nयह भी पढ़ें: Loksabha Election 2024 Result: यूसुफ पठान से लेकर कीर्ति आजाद तक...जानिए खेल जगत के किन सितारों को मिली जीत, किसे मिली हार\n\nयह भी पढ़ें: T20 World Cup: \"यह सही नहीं है...\" रोहित शर्मा ने फैंस को बर्बरतापूर्वक अरेस्ट किए जाने पर दिया बड़ा बयान\n\nपूरी स्टोरी पढ़ें\n\nNDTV.in पर ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों को ट्रैक करें, व देश के कोने-कोने से और दुनियाभर से न्यूज़ अपडेट पाएं\n\nफॉलो करे:\n\nIndia, Ireland, Cricket, ICC T20 World Cup 2024",

MVA को भले ही 30 सीटें मिली हों, लेकिन वोट शेयर लगभग उतना ही है. मुंबई में हमें दो सीटें मिलीं. कई सीटों पर मार्जिन बहुत कम है.\"\n\nफडणवीस ने आगे कहा कि महाराष्ट्र की जनता ने उन्हें नकारा नहीं है. आज पार्टी की एक बैठक भी हुई थी. उसमें चुनाव नतीजों के बारे में बात की गई. फडणवीस ने बताया कि कुछ लोग इस बैठक में मौजूद नहीं थे, इसलिए एक बार फिर वापस बैठक होगी. उन्होंने कहा कि एक बैठक सीएम एकनाथ शिंदे और डेप्युटी सीएम अजित पवार के साथ भी की जाएगी. फडणवीस ने कहा,\n\n\"मैं महाराष्ट्र में ऐसे नतीजों की जिम्मेदारी लेता हूं. मैं पार्टी का नेतृत्व कर रहा था. महाराष्ट्र में बीजेपी को जो झटका लगा उसकी पूरी जिम्मेदारी मैं लेता हूं. मैं बीजेपी आलाकमान से अनुरोध कर रहा हूं कि वे मुझे सरकार की जिम्मेदारी से मुक्त कर दें ताकि मैं आगामी चुनावों के लिए पार्टी के लिए कड़ी मेहनत कर सकूं.\"\n\nयह भी पढ़ें: Maharashtra Loksabha Election Results 2024: महाराष्ट्र में उद्धव ठाकरे की शिवसेना का क्या हाल रहा?\n\nहालांकि बीजेपी देवेंद्र फडणवीस को 'मुक्त' करने के मूड में बिल्कुल नहीं है. उनके बयान पर महाराष्ट्र भाजपा अध्यक्ष चन्द्रशेखर बावनकुले ने कहा,\n\n\"फडणवीस जी को सरकार से बाहर नहीं रहना है. वह चार दिन पार्टी को और तीन दिन सरकार को दे सकते हैं. पार्टी चाहती है कि फडणवीस जी सरकार का हिस्सा बनें और पार्टी के लिए भी काम करें.\"\n\nबावनकुले ने कहा कि वह केंद्र सरकार से बात करेंगे. हमने उनसे ऐसा कोई निर्णय न लेने का अनुरोध करेंगे.\n\nवहीं महाराष्ट्र के पूर्व मुख्यमंत्री अशोक चव्हाण का कहना है कि कोर कमेटी की बैठक में ऐसा कोई फैसला नहीं हुआ कि देवेंद्र फडणवीस को इस्तीफ़ा देना चाहिए.",

INDIA के पाले में 234 सीटें आई हैं, जिनमें से 99 सीट कांग्रेस के खाते में गई हैं. सिर्फ कांग्रेस की बात करें तो उसकी सीटों का आंकड़ा पिछली बार के मुकाबले लगभग डबल हो गया है.\n\nबीजेपी को इस बार 2019 के मुकाबले 1.1 फीसदी वोट का नुकसान हुआ है, जबकि कांग्रेस के वोट शेयर में करीब ढाई फीसदी का इजाफा हुआ है. चुनाव आयोग के अनुसार कांग्रेस को 21.2 वोट मिला है और 99 सीटों पर जीत मिली है. 2019 के मुकाबले यह आंकड़ा 2.3 फीसदी ज्यादा है और 47 सीटें ज्यादा हैं.\n\nएक और देखने वाली बात ये है कि 2014 और 2019 में कांग्रेस के वोट शेयर में 0.1 फीसदी का अंतर था, लेकिन सीटें 8 बढ़ गईं. चुनाव आयोग के अनुसार पिछले चुनाव में कांग्रेस को 19.67 फीसदी वोट मिला था, जबकि 52 सीटों पर दर्ज की थी. वहीं, 2014 के चुनाव में कांग्रेस के वोट शेयर में मामूली सा फर्क था, लेकिन सीटों में 8 का अंतर था. 2014 में कांग्रेस के पास 44 सीटें आई थीं.\n\nबीजेपी का वोट शेयर देखें तो उसका वोट 2019 के मुकाबले सिर्फ 1.1 फीसदी गिरा है, लेकिन 2014 के मुकाबले यह 5 फीसदी ज्यादा है. हालांकि, 2014 के मुकाबले इस बार बीजेपी के खाते में 42 कम सीटें आई हैं. सीटों और वोट शेयर के मामले में बीजेपी के लिए 2019 का साल सबसे अच्छा रहा. तीनों सालों की तुलना में 2019 में पार्टी का वोट और सीट दोनों का ही आंकड़ा हाईएस्ट था.\n\nबीजेपी का वोट शेयर 1 फीसदी गिरा है, लेकिन 2019 के मुकाबले 63 सीटें कम हो गईं. 2019 में बीजेपी ने 303 सीटों के साथ शानदार जीत दर्ज की थी, जबकि कांग्रेस का प्रदर्शन बेहद खराब रहा था. कांग्रेस की सीटें 52 से बढ़कर 99 हो गईं हैं और पिछली बार के मुकाबले इस बार बीजेपी की 63 सीटें घट गईं.",

INDIA गठबंधन को 234 सीटों पर जीत मिली है. जबकि NDA को कुल 293 सीटें मिली है. बावजूद इसके सरकार बनाने को लेकर काफी माथापच्ची हो रही है. 5 जून को दिल्ली में दोनों गठबंधनों की बैठक होनी है.\n\nइसको लेकर बिहार के दो बड़े नेता तेजस्वी यादव (Tejashwi Yadav) और मुख्यमंत्री नीतीश कुमार (Nitish Kumar) राष्ट्रीय राजधानी पहुंचे हैं. वो भी सेम फ्लाइट में. जिसका फोटो सोशल मीडिया पर खूब वायरल हो रहा है. जिसपर लोगों के मजेदार रिएक्शन सामने आ रहे हैं.\n\nये भी पढ़ें: नीतीश और तेजस्वी की एक ही फ्लाइट- एक ही 'मंजिल'! बिहार की सियासत में अटकलें तेज़ हो गईं\n\nएक यूजर ने मूवी का क्लिप शेयर कर लिखा,\n\n\"पूरा राइट विंग अभी नीतीश कुमार से...\"\n\nएक और यूजर ने मीम शेयर किया,\n\n\"नीतीश कुमार और तेजस्वी यादव\"\n\nएक और यूजर ने दोनों की फोटो शेयर कर लिखा,\n\n\"ये है आधिकारिक तस्वीर. नीतीश कुमार और तेजस्वी यादव एक ही फ्लाइट से बिहार से दिल्ली जा रहे हैं. खेल शुरू हो चुका है.\"\n\n\"दुनिया के महानतम स्क्रिप्ट राइटर नीतीश चाचा का आगमन.\"\n\nदरअसल इंडिया गठबंधन में शामिल RJD नेता तेजस्वी और NDA में शामिल नीतीश एक ही फ्लाइट से राजधानी के लिए पहुंचे हैं. रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक तेजस्वी और नीतीश विस्तारा की फ्लाइट UK-718 से दिल्ली पहुंचे हैं. फ्लाइट लेने से पहले पटना एयरपोर्ट के लिए निकलने वक्त तेजस्वी ने देश में 'मोदी फैक्टर' खत्म होने की बात कही. वहीं नीतीश के साथ एक ही फ्लाइट से जाने के सवाल पर उन्होंने मुस्कुराते हुए कहा कि उन्हें नहीं पता कि नीतीश कुमार भी इसी फ्लाइट से दिल्ली जा रहे हैं.\n\nये भी पढ़े- (नीतीश और तेजस्वी की एक ही फ्लाइट- एक ही 'मंजिल'! बिहार की सियासत में अटकलें तेज़ हो गईं)\n\nचुनाव परिणाम आने के बाद से इस बात की चर्चा शुरू हो गई है कि नीतीश कुमार फिर से पाला बदल सकते हैं. यानी वो NDA का साथ छोड़कर इंडिया गठबंधन का दामन थाम सकते हैं. 4 जून को मतगणना के दौरान भी ऐसी खबरें आईं जिसके बाद से नीतीश कुमार सोशल मीडिया पर हॉट टॉपिक बन गए हैं. बताते चलें कि बिहार में जदयू ने 16 सीटों पर अपने उम्मीदवार उतारे थे. इनमें से 12 सीटों पर उनको जीत मिली है. और पार्टी अगली सरकार बनाने में अहम रोल अदा कर सकती है.",

        "body": "पीएम मोदी के सामने अब कौन सी बड़ी चुनौतियां.\n\nनई दिल्ली:\n\nदेश में भले ही एक बार फिर मोदी सरकार बनने जा रही हो, लेकिन बात अब शायद पहले जैसी नहीं होगी. अब पीएम मोदी (PM Narendra Modi) के सामने कई बड़े चैलेंज होंगे. क्यों कि लोकसभा चुनाव (LokSabhe Elections) में जनता का मूड पता चल चुका है. एनडीए को 543 में से 292 सीटें, तो वहीं इंडिया गठबंधन के खाते में 232 सीटें आई है. बात अगर बीजेपी की करें तो उसको सिर्फ 240 सीटें मिली हैं, जबकि उम्मीद 300 पार की थी. बीजेपी के पास अब बहुमत नहीं है. ऐसे में एनडीए (NDA) के सहारे सरकार बन तो जाएगी, अब चुनौतियां भी काफी बढ़ गई हैं. कामकाजी फैसले लेते समय बीजेपी को सहयोगी दलों का भी ख्याल रखना होगा. बताते हैं कि देश के प्रधानमंत्री के सामने अगले 5 साल में कौन से 5 बड़े चैलेंज होंगे.\n\n1- PM मोदी के सामने पहला चैलेंज\n\nपूर्ण बहुमत न होने की वजह से अब कुनबे को प्राथिकता देनी होगी. प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी के सामने परिवार को एकुजट रखना बड़ी चुनौती होगी. कानून और बिल में अब सरकार को नीतीश कुमार और चंद्रबाबू नाडूय का भी ख्याल रखना होगा.\n\n2- PM मोदी के सामने दूसरा चैलेंज\n\nये बात तो जग जाहिर है कि नीतीश और नायडू, बीजेपी के दोनों ही साझीदार उनके प्राथमिकता वाले मुद्दों पर कभी एकजुट नहीं रहे हैं. नीतीश और नायडू दोनों ही नेता कीमत वसूलने में माहिर रहे हैं. अब बजट से लेकर राज्य तक के लिए वह मोदी सरकार से कुछ और ज्यादा की उम्मीद करेंगे. अब स्पेशल राज्य का मुद्दा बड़ा बना रहेगा. दोनों ही नेता बिहार और आंध्र प्रदेश के लिए पहले से ही स्पेशव राज्य की मांग करते रहे हैं.\n\n3- PM मोदी के सामने तीरा चैलेंज\n\nबीजेपी के सहयोगी दलों की विचारधारा उससे अलग है. कई मुद्दों को लेकर सहयोगी दलों और बीजेपी के बीच सोच का काफी अंतर है. यही वजह है कि कॉमन सिविल कोड पर मोदी सरकार को थोड़ा थमकर कदम बढ़ाने पड़ सकते हैं. 3-63 सीटों के इस झटके के बाद अब बीजेपी को पार्टी संगठन में भी बदलाव की ओर सोचना होगा. आने वाले दिनों में पार्टी रीस्टार्ट के मूड में दिखाई दे सकती है.\n\n4- PM मोदी के सामने चौथा चैलेंज\n\nपीएम मोदी ने अपने विजयी भाषण में इसके संकेत दिए कि उनकी सरकार बड़े फैसले लेगी. लेकिन यह 5 साल मोदी मैजिक की चमक को फिर से वापस लाने के भी होंगे, इसके लिए मोदी सरकार को अपनी नीतियों को और धरातल पर उतरना पड़ेगा.\n\n5- PM मोदी के सामने पांचवा चैलेंज\n\nआने वाले दिनों में महाराष्ट्र, दिल्ली और हरियाणा में विधानसभा चुनाव होने हैं. बीजेपी पर अब तीनों राज्यों में बेहतर प्रदर्शन का दवाब रहेगा. दिल्ली को छोड़ बाकी दो राज्यों में लोकसभा चुनाव के नतीजों ने पार्टी के लिए टेंशन बढ़ा दी है. दिल्ली में भले ही AAP का सफाया होता दिख रहा हो, लेकिन ये भी सच है कि विधानसभा चुनावों में उसने हमेशा जोरदार वापसी की है. ऐसे में बीजेपी को इस पर भी ध्यान देना होगा.\n\nये भी पढ़ें-1962 के बाद तीसरी बार रिपीट हुई कोई सरकार, BJP ने अकेले जीती INDIA से ज्यादा सीटें : PM मोदी\n\nपूरी स्टोरी पढ़ें\n\nNDTV.in पर ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों को ट्रैक करें, व देश के कोने-कोने से और दुनियाभर से न्यूज़ अपडेट पाएं\n\nफॉलो करे:\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024, Election Result, Bjp, Nda, Nitish Kumar",

        "body": "नई दिल्ली: एग्जिट पोल की इस बार पोल खुल गई। तमाम एग्जिट पोल में पीएम नरेंद्र मोदी की लहर के संकेत दिए गए थे लेकिन वास्तविकता यह है कि बीजेपी अपने खुद के बलबूते सरकार भी नहीं बना पा रही है। इसके लिए उसे अपने सहयोगियों का साथ चाहिए होगा। इस रिजल्ट से यह तथ्य एक बार फिर साफ हुआ है कि सटीक भविष्यवाणी का दावा करने वाले तथाकथित एक्सपर्ट का अपने एग्जिट पोल को लेकर कोई ठोस आधार नहीं था। किसी भी एग्जिट पोल में इस बात का खुलासा नहीं किया गया था कि बीजेपी बहुमत का आकड़ा नहीं हासिल कर पाएगी। हर एग्जिट पोल में NDA को 350 से ज्यादा और बीजेपी को 300 से ज्यादा सीटें दी गई थीं।2014 और 2019 में हुआ पास, अब 2024 में फेल\n\nएग्जिट पोल 2019 और 2014 में सही साबित हुआ था लेकिन उससे पहले 2004 और 2009 में भी राजनीतिक विशेषज्ञों और पोलस्टर्स का अनुमान फेल हुआ था। इस बात तीसरी बार बीजेपी की सरकार बनाने की भविष्यवाणी की गई थी और कई एग्जिट पोल में NDA को 400 से ज्यादा सीटें दी गई थीं लेकिन वह 400 के आंकड़े से करीब 100 सीट दूर रहा।\n\nAxis My India का एग्जिट पोल पूरी तरह फेल, सोशल मीडिया पर क्यों प्रदीप गुप्ता करने लगे ट्रेंड\n\n350 प्लस सीटों का था दावा\n\nएक्सिस माई इंडिया ने NDA को 361 से लेकर 401 सीटें दी थीं जबकि I.N.D.I.A. गठबंधन को 131 से लेकर 166 सीटें दी गई थीं। वहीं C वोटर ने 353 से लेकर 383 सीटें दी थीं। I.N.D.I.A. को सी वोटर ने 152 से लेकर 182 सीटें दी थीं। टूडे चाणक्य ने एनडीए को 400 सीटें देने का अनुमान लगाया था जबकि I.N.D.I.A. गठबंधन को 109 से लेकर 139 सीटें दी गई थीं। साथ ही सीएनएक्स ने एनडीए को 371 से लेकर 401 सीटें दी थीं। I.N.D.I.A. गठबंधन को उसने 109 से 139 सीटें दी थीं। टाइम्स नाऊ ETG ने NDA को 358 और I.N.D.I.A. गठबंधन को 152 सीटें दी थीं।\n\nअब जो आकड़े सामने आ रहे हैं, उनमें I.N.D.I.A. गठबंधन ने पश्चिम बंगाल, हरियाणा, पंजाब, राजस्थान जैसे राज्यों में काफी अच्छा प्रदर्शन किया है जबकि इन राज्यों में एग्जिट पोल में गठबंधन के लिए कड़ी परीक्षा बताई जा रही थी। एग्जिट पोल में TMC और बीजेपी को बराबरी की टक्कर पर बल्कि बीजेपी को बेहतर दिखाया गया था लेकिन रिजल्ट इसके उलट हुआ है और टीएमसी ने बेहतरीन प्रदर्शन किया है। वहीं यूपी में बीजेपी की लहर दिखाई गई थी लेकिन असलियत यह है कि यूपी में बीजेपी को बहुत बड़ा नुकसान हुआ है।\n\nLok Sabha Election Result 2024: एग्जिट पोल्स फिर फेल! भाजपा को अकेले नहीं मिलता दिख रहा बहुमत, 400 पार का नारा भी 'जुमला'\n\nउल्टा पड़ गया आकलन\n\nसभी पोलस्टर्स सहमत थे कि मोदी की अगुआई में एनडीए 350 से लेकर 400 सीटें जीतेंगी। 2014 और 2019 से भी ज्यादा बड़ी जीत की संभावना बताई गई थी लेकिन 2014 और 2019 के उलट बीजेपी का इस बार सबसे कमजोर प्रदर्शन रहा है। बीजेपी अपनी बदौलत 272 का जादुई आंकड़ा भी नहीं पहुंच पाई है। ऐसा पहली बार नहीं हुआ है जब एग्जिट पोल की भविष्यवाणी फेल हुई है। 2004 से पहले के आम चुनाव के दौरान भी एग्जिट पोल गलत साबित हुए थे, जब सभी ने अटल बिहारी बाजपेयी की अगुआई में बीजेपी की सत्ता वापसी की भविष्यवाणी की थी लेकिन वह गलत साबित हुई थी। 2009 में यूपीए ने मजबूती से वापसी की थी जबकि इस दौरान भी पोलस्टर्स सटीक अनुमान लगाने में विफल रहे थे।\n\nहाल-ए-एग्जिट पोल\n\n2004: फेल\n\n2009: फेल\n\n2014: पास\n\n2019: पास",

यहां समझें...\n\nअमेरिका और यूरोप से रिश्ते\n\nअमेरिका, जापान और ऑस्ट्रेलिया के साथ भारत क्वाड समूह का हिस्सा है. यह एशिया-प्रशांत क्षेत्र में चीन की बढ़ती मुखरता के खिलाफ है. राष्ट्रपति जो बाइडेन ने पिछले साल राजकीय रात्रिभोज के लिए नरेंद्र मोदी की मेजबानी की थी और नई दिल्ली के साथ वाशिंगटन के संबंधों को \"21वीं सदी की निर्णायक साझेदारी\" कहा था. फरवरी में, वाशिंगटन ने भारत को अत्याधुनिक ड्रोनों की 4 बिलियन डॉलर की बिक्री को मंजूरी दे दी, जो अपने उत्तरी पड़ोसी के प्रति संतुलन में भारत को मजबूती देती है. अमेरिका और भारत के संबंध और बेहतर होंगे. भारत के यूरोपीय देशों के साथ भी संबंध बढ़ रहे हैं और उसे फ्रांस के साथ राफेल लड़ाकू जेट और स्कॉर्पियन श्रेणी की पनडुब्बियों की बिक्री सहित बहु-अरब डॉलर के रक्षा सौदों का विस्तार करने की उम्मीद है.\n\nचीन के साथ कैसे होंगे संबंध?\n\nExit Poll आने के बाद चीन के मुखपत्र ग्लोबल टाइम्स ने लिखा था कि मोदी के फिर से सत्ता में आने से दोनों देशों के संबंध अच्छे होंगे. बीजिंग और नई दिल्ली दोनों शंघाई सहयोग संगठन मंच के सदस्य हैं. हालांकि, दुनिया के दो सबसे अधिक आबादी वाले देशों के बीच संबंधों में 2020 में गिरावट तब आई, जब उनके सैनिकों ने उनकी 3,500 किलोमीटर (2,200 मील) सीमा पर अत्यधिक ऊंचाई पर घातक झड़प की. परमाणु संपन्न एशियाई दिग्गजों के हजारों सैनिक एक-दूसरे पर आंखें तरेरते रहते हैं और क्षेत्रीय दावे बढ़ते रहते हैं, लेकिन उनकी प्रतिद्वंद्विता के बावजूद चीन भारत का दूसरा सबसे बड़ा व्यापार भागीदार है. एक वरिष्ठ पूर्व राजदूत, जयंत प्रसाद ने कहा कि उन्हें उम्मीद है कि दोनों देशों के बीच \"प्रतिकूल संबंध\" कायम रहेंगे. उन्होंने कहा, \"भारत अपने दोस्तों के साथ मिलकर चीन की आक्रामकता पर लगाम लगाने की कोशिश करेगा.\" वहीं राजनाथ सिंह ने हाल ही में एक टीवी इंटरव्यू में कहा था कि चीन पर जल्द खुशखबरी मिल सकती है. जाहिर है वह सीमा विवाद को लेकर बोल रहे थे. अगर ऐसा होता है तो संबंध अच्छे भी हो सकते हैं.\n\n'ग्लोबल साउथ' पर मुखर रहेंगे मोदी?\n\nनरेंद्र मोदी ने इस सप्ताह नई दिल्ली को \"ग्लोबल साउथ की एक मजबूत और महत्वपूर्ण आवाज\" कहा, और पिछले साल भारत ने दो \"वॉयस ऑफ द ग्लोबल साउथ\" शिखर सम्मेलन की मेजबानी की, क्योंकि उसने एशियाई, अफ्रीकी और दक्षिण अमेरिकी देशों के प्रतिनिधि के रूप में अपनी भूमिका को मजबूत करने की मांग की थी. यह मोदी की देखरेख में ही था कि अफ्रीकी संघ गुट जी20 का स्थायी सदस्य बन गया, भारत का तर्क है कि विकासशील देशों को वैश्विक निर्णय लेने में अधिक भागीदारी की आवश्यकता है. भारत उभरती अर्थव्यवस्थाओं वाले ब्रिक्स क्लब का संस्थापक सदस्य भी है.\n\nरूस से संबंध कैसे रहेंगे?\n\nनई दिल्ली और मॉस्को के बीच शीत युद्ध के समय से संबंध हैं और रूस अब तक भारत का सबसे बड़ा हथियार आपूर्तिकर्ता बना हुआ है. नई दिल्ली ने यूक्रेन पर आक्रमण के लिए रूस की स्पष्ट निंदा से परहेज किया है, मास्को की निंदा करने वाले संयुक्त राष्ट्र के प्रस्तावों पर रोक लगा दी है, और रूसी कच्चे तेल की आपूर्ति भी कर रहा है. मोदी ने मार्च में राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन को उनके दोबारा चुने जाने पर बधाई दी थी और कहा था कि वह उनके \"विशेष\" रिश्ते को विकसित करने के लिए उत्सुक हैं. जाहिर है, रूस के साथ भारत के संबंध और ऊंचाई पर जा सकते हैं.\n\nपाकिस्तान का क्या होगा?\n\nइस्लामाबाद पर सीमा पार आतंकवाद का आरोप लगाने के बाद से मोदी सरकार ने ऐतिहासिक प्रतिद्वंद्वी पाकिस्तान के साथ बातचीत करने से इनकार कर दिया है. 1947 में उपमहाद्वीप के विभाजन से अलग होने के बाद से दोनों देशों ने तीन युद्ध और कई छोटी झड़पें लड़ी हैं. पाक अधिकृत कश्मीर को लेकर दोनों देशों में तनाव रहा है. 2015 में मोदी ने पाकिस्तानी शहर लाहौर का अचानक दौरा किया लेकिन 2019 में संबंधों में गिरावट आई. मार्च में, मोदी ने पाकिस्तानी समकक्ष शहबाज शरीफ को प्रधानमंत्री पद पर लौटने पर बधाई दी. परमाणु-सशस्त्र पड़ोसियों के नेताओं के बीच सद्भावना की यह दुर्लभ घटना मानी गई. मगर, इसके बाद संबंधों में कुछ खास नहीं हुआ. अब आगे क्या होगा, इस पर पाकिस्तान सबसे ज्यादा चिंतित है.\n\nभारत की चुनाव प्रणाली की कई देशों ने की सराहना\n\nश्रीलंका के राष्ट्रपति रानिल विक्रमसिंघे और नेपाल के प्रधानमंत्री पुष्प कमल दहल 'प्रचंड' ने आम चुनावों में भारतीय जनता पार्टी (भाजपा) नीत राष्ट्रीय जनतांत्रिक गठबंधन (राजग) के बहुमत हासिल करने पर प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी को बधाई दी और उनके साथ मिलकर काम करने की इच्छा जताई.संयुक्त राष्ट्र महासचिव एंतोनियो गुतारेस ने भारत के लोगों को ''लोकतंत्र की व्यापक प्रक्रिया में'' शामिल होने के लिए बधाई दी.\n\nपूरी स्टोरी पढ़ें\n\nNDTV.in पर ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों को ट्रैक करें, व देश के कोने-कोने से और दुनियाभर से न्यूज़ अपडेट पाएं\n\nफॉलो करे:\n\nModi 3rd Tenure, Modi Diplomacy, India Relations With World, Lok Sabha Election Result 2024",

NDA बुधवार को सरकार बनाने का दावा पेश कर सकती है. उसने अपने घटकदलों की बुधवार को बैठक बुलाई है. पीएम ने बिहार के सीएम नीतीश कुमार (Nitish Kumar) और टीडीपी (TDP) नेता चंद्रबाबू नायडू (Chandrababu Naidu) को फोन कर बैठक के लिए बुलाया है.",

BJP अकेले अपने दम पर बहुमत का भी आंकड़ा नहीं छू सकी, हालांकि एनडीए (NDA) ने बहुमत (272) का आंकड़ा पार कर लिया है. चुनाव आयोग की आधिकारिक वेब साइट पर प्राप्त जानकारी के अनुसार अब तक एनडीए 295+ सीटों पर जीत या बढ़त बनाए हुए हैं, वहीं इंडिया गठबंधन भी 231+ सीटों पर आगे है. इस लोकसभा चुनाव कोई भी पार्टी बहुमत का आंकड़ा पार नहीं कर पाई, बीजेपी को 240 सीटों पर जीत मिली तो कांग्रेस ने सभी 100 सीटों पर विजयी परचम लहराया.\n\nकांग्रेस के वरिष्ठ नेता राहुल गांधी वायनाड और रायबरेली दोनों सीटों पर 350,000 से अधिक वोटों के अंतर से जीत दर्ज की है. वहीं प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी ने वाराणसी में लगातार तीसरा बार जीत की हैट्रिक लगाई. बीजेपी को उत्तर प्रदेश में अखिलेश यादव की समाजवादी पार्टी ने बड़ झटका दिया है, भाजपा ने राज्य में सिर्फ 35 सीटों पर जीत दर्ज की. यहां तक कि अयोध्या को राम मंदिर का तोहफा देने वाली बीजेपी को ही फैजाबाद लोकसभा सीट पर हार का सामना करना पड़ा. अयोध्या फैजाबाद सीट के तहत आता है, इस सीट पर सपा के अवधेश प्रसाद ने बीजेपी के लल्लू सिंह को बड़े मार्जिन से मात दिया.\n\nइस लोकसभा चुनाव में बिहार के मुख्यमंत्री और जेडीयू प्रमुख नीतीश कुमार और तेलुगु देशम पार्टी के नेता एन चंद्रबाबू नायडू किंग मेकर बनकर उभरे हैं. टीडीपी ने अपने दम पर 16 सीटें जीत ली हैं, जबकि एनडीए ने आंध्र प्रदेश में 25 में से 21 सीटों पर जीत हासिल की है. बिहार में, नीतीश कुमार की जेडीयू अपने सहयोगी की तुलना में कम निर्वाचन क्षेत्रों में चुनाव लड़ने के बावजूद, बीजेपी के बराबर 12 सीटें जीतने के लिए तैयार है. जैसे ही शाम तक चुनावी तस्वीर साफ हो गई, ऐसी खबरें आने लगीं कि INDIA के नेता बहुमत जुटाने के प्रयासों में दोनों दिग्गजों (नीतीश कुमार और एन चंद्रबाबू नायडू) से संपर्क कर रहे हैं. हालांक अभी तक कांग्रेस ने इन खबरों की पुष्टि नहीं की है. कांग्रेस अध्यक्ष मल्लिकार्जुन खड़गे ने कहा कि वे आगे का फैसला लेने के लिए बुधवार को 'इंडिया' गठबंधन के अन्य सहयोगियों के साथ बैठक करेंगे.\n\nदेश की राजधानी दिल्ली में बुधवार (5 जून) को राजनीतिक दलों की कई अहम और बड़ी बैठकें होनी हैं. एक और जहां बुधवार को दिल्ली में कांग्रेस व उसके सहयोगियों 'इंडिया गठबंधन' की बैठक होगी. वहीं भाजपा के नेतृत्व वाले एनडीए की भी बैठक होगी. केंद्रीय कैबिनेट की मीटिंग भी बुधवार सुबह हो सकती है. इसके अलावा राष्ट्रपति भवन में 5 जून से केंद्रीय मंत्रिमंडल के शपथ ग्रहण की तैयारी शुरू होगी. इसी तैयारी के लिए राष्ट्रपति भवन 5 से 9 जून तक आम लोगों के लिए बंद रहेगा. माना जा रहा है कि राष्ट्रपति भवन में 9 जून को नई सरकार का शपथ ग्रहण समारोह हो सकता है. आंध्र प्रदेश में जबरदस्त जीत दर्ज करने वाले तेलुगू देशम पार्टी के मुखिया चंद्रबाबू नायडू भी 5 जून को दिल्ली पहुंचेंगे. चंद्रबाबू नायडू की पार्टी एनडीए का हिस्सा है. कांग्रेस नेता राहुल गांधी का कहना है कि 5 जून को इंडिया गठबंधन की बैठक है, जिसमें आगे की रणनीति तय की जाएगी.",

        "title": "Analysis: कितना अलग होगा मोदी सरकार का थर्ड टर्म? 'INDIA' के लिए क्या है मैसेज? संजय पुगलिया ने समझाया",
        "body": "पीएम मोदी तीसरी बार वाराणसी से सांसद चुने गए हैं. तीसरी बार प्रधानमंत्री बनने जा रहे हैं.\n\nनई दिल्ली:\n\nदेश में 18वीं लोकसभा चुनाव (Lok Sabha Election Result 2024) के नतीजे करीब-करीब साफ हो गए हैं. 542 सीटों की काउंटिंग पूरी हो गई है. केंद्र में तीसरी बार नरेंद्र मोदी (PM Narendra Modi) के नेतृत्व में NDA की सरकार बनने जा रही है. लेकिन इस बार BJP बहुमत से दूर है, लिहाजा उसे गठबंधन के सहयोगियों पर निर्भर रहना होगा. नतीजों के मुताबिक, NDA को 291 सीटों पर जीत मिली. जबकि विपक्षी दलों के गठबंधन INDIA (INDIA Alliance) को 234 सीटें मिल रही हैं. 2014 में BJP को 278 और 2019 में 303 सीटें मिली थीं. वहीं, नेहरू के बाद नरेंद्र मोदी तीसरी बार पीएम बनने वाले दूसरे नेता होंगे. NDA बुधवार को सरकार बनाने का दावा पेश कर सकती है. उसने अपने घटकदलों की बुधवार को बैठक बुलाई है. पीएम ने बिहार के सीएम नीतीश कुमार (Nitish Kumar) और टीडीपी (TDP) नेता चंद्रबाबू नायडू (Chandrababu Naidu) को फोन कर बैठक के लिए बुलाया है.\n\nचूंकि BJP लोकसभा चुनाव में बहुमत के लिए 272 का आंकड़ा पार नहीं कर पाई है. NDTV के एडिटर इन चीफ संजय पुगलिया ने समझाया कि BJP को पूर्ण बहुमत नहीं मिलने की स्थिति में मोदी सरकार का थर्ड टर्म 2014 और 2019 के मुकाबले कितना अलग होगा:-\n\nनीतीश, चिराग, चंद्रबाबू नायडू और जयंत चौधरी ने कैसे बचाई NDA की लाज, आंकड़ों से समझिए\n\nकितना अलग होगा मोदी सरकार का थर्ड टर्म?\n\nऐसी स्थिति में वक्त के मुताबिक और समय की मांग के हिसाब से कोई भी अच्छा राजनेता लचीलेपन का परिचय देगा. क्योंकि जब आप बड़े लक्ष्य के लिए काम कर रहे हैं, और आपको सरकार चलानी है तो आपको सोच कुछ बदलनी होगा. आपको देश की मांग को समझना होगा. इस बार देश की मांग निरंतरता और स्थायित्व है. इसके लिए गठबंधन सरकार के लीडर को सहयोगियों को साथ में लेकर चलना और उन्हें मैनेज करना दोनों आना चाहिए. इस केस में NDA की एक हिस्ट्री रही है. पीएम मोदी की भी एक हिस्ट्री रही है. कुछ लोग तर्क देते हैं कि सिंपल मैजॉरिटी नहीं मिलने पर BJP की निर्भरता NDA के सहयोगियों पर बढ़ गई है, इससे सरकार का स्वरूप बदल जाएगा. वास्तव में देखा जाए, तो ऐसा नहीं है. अगर आपकी नियत साफ है और जज्बा साफ है तो आप ऐसी सरकार चला लेंगे. क्योंकि ये तीसरी बार केंद्र में नरेंद्र मोदी को लाने का जनादेश है. INDIA की सरकार बनाने का जनादेश नहीं है.\n\nऐतिहासिक चुनाव का ऐतिहासिक जनादेश\n\nभारत का लोकसभा चुनाव दुनिया के इतिहास में, लोकतांत्रिक देश के इतिहास में सबसे अहम चुनाव है. ये चुनाव ऐतिहासिक ही निकला है. इसका जनादेश भी ऐतिहासिक है. जो नंबर आए हैं, उसका कोल्ड एनालिसिस करें तो समझेंगे कि BJP और NDA की सरकार लौट रही है. मोदी सरकार की ये हैट्रिक है. केंद्र में तीसरी बार नरेंद्र मोदी की सरकार बनने जा रही है. इस चुनाव में सबसे बड़ा मैसेज इतिहास बनाना है. देश के पहले पीएम पंडित जवाहर लाल नेहरू के बाद ये पहली बार है, जहां एक स्पष्ट बहुमत के साथ किसी सरकार की वापसी हो रही है. इसमें नरेंद्र मोदी की रणनीति किस तरह से काम आई, इसे भी समझने की जरूरत है.\n\nनीतीशे कुमार हैं... बिहार में 'कमजोर कड़ी' साबित हो रही ट्रंप कार्ड, टारगेट पर लगे JDU के तीर\n\nJDS, नीतीश कुनार और नायडू के आने से फायदा\n\nइसमें चुनाव के आखिरी दिनों का जिक्र भी जरूरी है. चुनाव के आखिरी दिनों में BJP JDS को लेकर आई. नीतीश कुमार को लेकर आई. चंद्रबाबू नायडू को लेकर आई. NDA में जो 3 नए सहयोगी आए, उसके नतीजे इलेक्शन रिजल्ट के तौर पर सामने है. इससे ये पता चलता है कि ग्राउंड रियालिटी, फील्ड वर्क और स्ट्रैटजी के आधार पर BJP कितने लचीलेपन के साथ खुद को मैनेज कर सकती है.\n\nचुनाव नतीजे ने दिए ये 3 मैसेज\n\nइस चुनाव के कई मैसेज हैं. पहला मैसेज- ये लोकसभा चुनाव बिल्कुल तीसरी बार की इंकमबेंसी का होने के बावजूद ऐसा स्पष्ट जनादेश कि हम सरकार को जारी रखना चाहते हैं. हम नीतियों को जारी रखना चाहते हैं. दूसरा-BJP की अब तक सिंगल और क्लियर मेजॉरिटी थी. उसके सामने एक गठबंधन सरकार के युग की शुरुआत हो गई है. इस तरह की सरकार 2014 के पहले तक देश में थी. तीसरा- गठबंधन सरकार के युग में दो लोग NDA की टेंप्रामेंट के साथ अच्छी तरह से कंफर्टेबल नजर आते हैं, वो हैं चंद्रबाबू नायडू और नीतीश कुमार. ये दोनों NDA के भरोसेमंद पार्टनर हैं. यानी मुलाकातों और फोन कॉल का दौर कुछ घंटों से ज्यादा चल नहीं पाएगा. इस चुनाव में एक बैलेंस का मैसेज भी है.\"\n\n\"नई ऊर्जा, नई उमंग, नए संकल्प के साथ आगे बढ़ेंगे...\", PM नरेंद्र मोदी ने चुनाव परिणाम पर दी प्रतिक्रिया\n\nविपक्ष के लिए भी सीख\n\nइस चुनाव में विपक्ष के लिए खास मैसेज है. हारी हुई बाज़ी को कैसे जीतना है, ये मोदी से सीखिए. जहां जीत सकते हैं, उसको कैसे हार जाए. लास्ट बैच में कैसे हाफ जाए... ये अपोजिशन से सीखिए. ये जनादेश देश की जनता ने दिया है. विपक्ष के विरोधाभासों, आलस्य के बावजूद, कंफ्यूजन के बावजूद, कमजोर नैरेटिव के बावजूद जनता का फैसला है. इस चुनाव में विपक्ष के लिए ये मैसेज है कि उन्हें थोड़ा आलस कम करना चाहिए था. समय रहते एक्टिव होना चाहिए था. एकजुट होना चाहिए था. कंफ्यूजन को दूर करके मजबूत नैरेटिव पर काम करना चाहिए था. अगर INDIA वाले समय रहते फैसले लेते, तो शायद नंबर कुछ और हो सकता था.\n\nBJP ने ऐसे दी साइलेंट एंटी इंकमबेंसी को मात\n\nपीएम मोदी अपनी नीतियों को लेकर हमेशा से फीडबैक लेते रहे हैं. ऐसा करके वो जमीनी हकीकत को समझते हुए आगे काम करना चाहते हैं. आप कल्पना करिए अगर ये तीन सहयोगी साथ नहीं होते, BJP की परिस्थिति और इस जनादेश का आउटकम कुछ और होता. गौर करने वाली बात ये भी है कि BJP हमेशा एक नए क्षेत्र की पहचान करती है और वहां काम करके उसे अपना बनाने की कोशिश करती है. ओडिशा में कुछ ऐसा ही हुआ. यहां विधानसभा चुनाव में BJP को पूर्ण बहुमत मिला है. BJP पूर्ण बहुमत से सरकार बनाने जा रही है. यानी फीडबैक, सोची-समझी रणनीति और जुझारूपन से BJP ने इस साइलेंट एंटी इंकमबेंसी को मात दी.\n\nराहुल को जीती बाजी हारना आता है! न करते वो जिद तो आज बन सकती थी सरकार\n\nपूरी स्टोरी पढ़ें\n\nNDTV.in पर ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों को ट्रैक करें, व देश के कोने-कोने से और दुनियाभर से न्यूज़ अपडेट पाएं\n\nफॉलो करे:\n\nLok Sabha Election Result 2024, NDA, BJP, Narendra Modi, INDIA Alliance",

        "body": "Loksabha Election Result 2024: दिल्ली की चांदनी चौक लोकसभा सीट पर भाजपा उम्मीदवार प्रवीण खंडेलवाल ने जीत दर्ज कर ली है। उन्होंने बेहद नजदीकी मुकाबले में कांग्रेस के जेपी अग्रवाल को मात दी। इस सीट पर यह भाजपा की लगातार तीसरी जीत है, इसके साथ ही उसने दिल्ली की सातों लोकसभा सीटों पर भी जीत दर्ज करने की हैट्रिक भी लगा ली।\n\nचांदनी चौक में इस बार मुकाबला पुराने कैंडिडेट और नए के बीच था। पहली बार सांसद का चुनाव लड़ रहे खंडेलवाल ने कांग्रेस के पांच बार के सांसद रह चुके जय प्रकाश अग्रवाल को हराया। खंडेलवाल ने यह मुकाबला 89,325 मतों से जीता। चुनाव में भाजपा प्रत्याशी को 5,16,496 वोट मिले, वहीं कांग्रेस उम्मीदवार को 4,27,171 वोट मिले।\n\n79 वर्षीय अग्रवाल दिल्ली के सबसे बुजुर्ग उम्मीदवार थे और इससे पहले तीन बार 1984, 1989 और 1996 में चांदनी चौक सीट जीत चुके हैं। हालांकि, 2019 में भी वे इसी सीट से चुनाव हार गए थे। भाजपा प्रत्याशी ने इस बार इस सीट पर जीत तो दर्ज की लेकिन पिछले चुनाव की तुलना में जीत का अंतर कम हुआ है। पिछली बार भाजपा ने यह सीट 2 लाख से ज्यादा वोटों से जीती थी।\n\n2019 में हुए पिछले लोकसभा चुनाव में चांदनी चौक सीट पर दिलचस्प त्रिकोणीय मुकाबला देखने को मिला था, जब भाजपा ने हर्षवर्धन, कांग्रेस ने जेपी अग्रवाल और आम आदमी पार्टी (AAP) ने पंकज कुमार गुप्ता को मैदान में उतारा था। तब भाजपा को 52.92% से ज्यादा वोट मिले थे और उसने 2.28 लाख वोटों के अंतर से जीत हासिल की। जबकि इस बार कांग्रेस और AAP ने INDIA गठबंधन के तहत यहां मिलकर चुनाव लड़ा था।\n\nअपनी जीत के बाद खंडेलवाल ने एचटी ग्रुप से बात की और कहा कि वह लोगों के लिए काम करने और बदलाव लाने के इस मौके का इंतजार कर रहे थे। उन्होंने कहा, 'प्रचार के दौरान मैंने कहा था कि मैं लोगों के लिए खुद को पूरी तरह से सुलभ बनाऊंगा और लोगों की शिकायतों को सुनने के लिए सड़कों पर बाजार में बैठूंगा। मैं यह सुनिश्चित करूंगा कि मैं एक सांसद के रूप में ऐसा करूं। मैंने हमेशा व्यापारियों के हित में काम किया है और अब मेरे पास उनके लिए बदलाव लाने का अधिकार होगा। जीएसटी का सरलीकरण, व्यापारियों को व्यवसायों में प्रौद्योगिकी का उपयोग करने के लिए प्रशिक्षण, जेजे कॉलोनियों का विकास और बाजार क्षेत्रों में बुनियादी ढांचे का विकास हमारी कुछ प्राथमिकताएं होंगी।'\n\nचांदनी चौक लोकसभा क्षेत्र में 16 लाख से ज्यादा मतदाता हैं और इसमें 10 विधानसभा क्षेत्र- मॉडल टाउन, त्रिनगर, शकूर बस्ती, शालीमार बाग, आदर्श नगर, चांदनी चौक, सदर बाज़ार, बल्लीमारान, वजीरपुर और मटिया महल आते हैं।",

        "body": "Lok Sabha Election 2024: बहरामपुर लोकसभा क्षेत्र से सुफ पठान ने जीत दर्ज की\n\nसाल 2007 और 2011 में विश्व विजेता बनने वाली भारतीय टीम का हिस्सा रहे यूसुफ पठान ने राजनीति की पिच पर उतरते ही पहली ही गेंद पर छक्का जड़ा है. टीएमसी के टिकट पर लोकसभा चुनाव में पश्चिम बंगाल के मुर्शिदाबाद जिले के बहरामपुर लोकसभा क्षेत्र से चुनावी मैदान में उतरे यूसुफ पठान ने कांग्रेस के अधीर रंजन चौधरी को हरा दिया है. यूसुफ पठान की यह जीत ऐतिहासिक है क्योंकि बीते 25 सालों में पहली बार कांग्रेस नेता अधीर रंजन चौधरी इस सीट पर चुवान हारे हैं. भारत निर्वाचन आयोग के आंकड़ों के अनुसार मतगणना के शुरुआती घंटों में पठान तीसरे स्थान पर थे लेकिन मतगणना आगे बढ़ने के साथ उनकी संख्या बढ़ती गई और वे चौधरी तथा भाजपा के निर्मल कुमार साहा से आगे निकल गए.\n\nचुनाव आयोग के डेटा के अनुसार, शाम 6:35 तक यूसुफ पठान को 5,22,974 वोट मिले थे, जो कुल वोट का 37.92 प्रीतिशत थे. जबकि दूसरे स्थान पर रहे कांग्रेस के अधिर रंजन चौधरी को 4,37,646 वोट मिले जो कुल वोटों का 31.73 प्रतिशत रहे. जबकि इस सीट पर बीजेपी के डॉ निर्मल कुमार साहा तीसरे स्थान पर रहे और उन्हें 369867 बोट मिले. यूसुफ पठान जीत की ओर बढ़ रहे हैं और उन्होंने 85,328 वोटों की बढ़त बनाई हुई है. हालांकि, यूसुफ पठान के भाई इरफान पठान ने सोशल मीडिया एक्स पर अपने भाई की जीत का दावा करते हुए लिखा है कि मेरा भाई जीत गया.\n\nइरफान पठान ने एक्स पर पोस्ट किया,\"अपने नेक उद्देश्य में दृढ़ विश्वास के साथ, आप अनुभवी राजनेताओं पर विजय पाने की कठिन यात्रा पर निकल पड़े. ईमानदारी और अटूट संकल्प से लैस, आपके नेक इरादे परिवर्तनकारी कार्यों में तब्दील हों, जिससे हमारे देश के नागरिकों का जीवन समृद्ध हो. मेरा भाई जीत गया.\"\n\nबता दें, लोकसभा की सभी 543 सीटों के रुझान आ चुके हैं. कांग्रेस की अगुवाई में INDIA गठबंधन ने आप्रत्याशित रूप से 229 सीटों पर बढ़त बनाई हुई है. जबकि बीजेपी की अगुवाई वाली एनडीए गठबंधन 296 सीटों पर लीड में है. प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी से चुनावों में एनडीए के लिए 400 पार का नारा दिया था, जिससे बीजेपी और एनडीए काफी पीछे दूर नजर आ रही है. बीजेपी ने साल 2014 और 2019 के परिणामों में अपने दम पर बहुमत का आंकड़ा पार किया था. लेकिन बीजेपी इस पास 272 के जादुई आंकड़े से दूर है. बीजेपी ने 93 सीटें जीत ली हैं जबकि 146 सीटों पर वो अभी भी रुझानों में बढ़त बनाए हुए हैं. बात अगर पश्चिम बंगाल की करें तो राज्य की 42 लोकसभा सीटों में से 29 पर टीएमसी आगे है जबकि 12 पर बीजेपी और एक पर कांग्रेस आगे है.\n\nयह भी पढ़ें: \"मुझे पहले लव इंटरेस्ट...\" नए प्यार की तलाश में सानिया मिर्ज़ा? टेनिस सुपरस्टार ने कपिल शर्मा के शो पर खोला राज\n\nयह भी पढ़ें: \"चाहे ट्रॉफी जीतो या नहीं, लेकिन भारत से मत हारना\" मोहम्मज रिजवान ने पूर्व PCB अध्यक्ष से मिले मैसेज का किया खुलासा\n\nपूरी स्टोरी पढ़ें Comments\n\nNDTV.in पर ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों को ट्रैक करें, व देश के कोने-कोने से और दुनियाभर से न्यूज़ अपडेट पाएं\n\nफॉलो करे: Yusuf Khan Pathan, Cricket, India",

        "body": "Rahul Gandhi Election Result: लोकसभा चुनाव 2024 के अंतिम रूझान और रिजल्ट को देख कांग्रेस नेता राहुल गांधी पूरे मूड में थे. हाथ में संविधान की प्रति के साथ प्रेस के सामने आए. इससे पहले मल्लिकार्जुन खरगे उनका होमवर्क कर चुके थे. उनकी भारत जोड़ो और भारत जोड़ो न्याय यात्रा की भूमिका बताकर. राहुल ने संविधान को दिखाया और कहा कि जनादेश इसी को बचाने का है. जब वो बोल रहे थे तब INDIA गठबंधन 235 सीटों पर आगे था और भारतीय जनता पार्टी की अगुआई में एनडीए 290 सीटों पर आगे. यानी बहुमत के लिए जरूरी 272 सीटों से 18 आगे. पर, ट्विस्ट बीजेपी के सरकते जनाधार ने पैदा किया है. 2014 और 2019 लोकसभा चुनाव के उलट बीजेपी 240 सीटों पर सिमटती दिख रही है. यानी अकेले दम पर बहुमत से 32 सीटें पीछे छूट रही है. ये 2019 के 303 के आंकड़े से तो बेहद कम है. इसी कांग्रेस खेमे में उत्साह पैदा कर दिया कि राहुल गांधी चाहें तो अगली सरकार बना सकते हैं.\n\nतो जब एक पत्रकार ने पूछा कि आप जनादेश को गरीबों की जीत बता रहे हैं, ऐसे में उनके लिए विपक्ष में बैठ कर काम करना पसंद करेंगे या सरकार बनाने की कोशिश करेंगे. इस सवाल का जवाब देने से पहले राहुल गांधी ने खरगे से बोलने को कहा. राहुल ने इस बात का मान रखा कि खरगे पार्टी के अध्यक्ष हैं. जब खरगे ने उन्हीं से गुजारिश कर दी तो राहुल बोले - देखिए यहां एक फाइन लाइन है. और मैं बिना अपने सहयोगियों से पूछे इसका जवाब नहीं दे सकता. कल शायद बैठक है. हम बात करेंगे फिर तय करेंगे कि जो दल हमारे साथ नहीं है, क्या उनसे बात की जाए.\n\nइस लिहाज से राहुल का अंदाज काफी संजीदा था. गठबंधन धर्म की बारीकियों को समझते हुए उन्होंने इस सवाल को टाल दिया. लेकिन अगर सरकार बनाने का दावा पेश करना हो तो नंबर कहां से आएंगे. निश्चित तौर पर इसके लिए एनडीए में सेंधमारी करनी होगी. दो सबसे बड़े पार्टनर्स पर उनकी नजर होगी- तेलुगुदेशम पार्टी (टीडीपी) जिसके 16 सांसद हैं औऱ नीतीश कुमार की जनता दल यूनाईटेड (जेडीयू) जिसके 12 सांसद हैं. इसके अलावा सात निर्दलीय एक बड़ा चंक है. तीनों को मिलाकर 35 का जुगाड़ होता है और इंडिया के पास है 235. अब 35 और जोड़ दें तो आंकड़ा पहुंचता है 270. जादुई नंबर से दो कम.\n\nलेकिन चांस अभी भी है. राजनीति संभावनाओं का खेल है. किसी भी कैलकुलेशन को इग्नोर नहीं कर सकते. असदुद्दीन ओवैसी की AIMIM मोदी के नाम पर राहुल गांधी को सपोर्ट कर सकती है. इसके अलावा नगीना लोकसभा सीट से जीते आजाद समाज पार्टी के चंद्रशेखर आजाद उर्फ रावण भी हैं. नीतीश कुमार की तरह यू टर्न पॉलिटिक्स के माहिर जेडीएस के दो सांसद होने की संभावना है. अगर ये मिला दें तो आंकड़ा 274 पहुंच सकता है. लेकिन ये कहना आसान है करना मुश्किल क्योंकि केसी त्यागी साफ कर चुके हैं कि नीतीश अप पलटी नहीं मारेंगे. उधर चंद्रबाबू नायडू जिस हाल से गुजरे हैं उसके बाद बने अपने साथी को छोड़ना कतई पसंद नहीं करेंगे क्योंकि उनका सीएम बनना तय है. वो डबल इंजन लगाने में ही भलाई समझेंगे.",

        "body": "लोकसभा चुनाव में विपक्ष के इंडिया गठबंधन ने बेहतर प्रदर्शन किया है.\n\nनई दिल्ली:\n\nLok Sabha Elections 2024 Results: लोकसभा चुनाव 2024 के रुझान और नतीजे जैसे-जैसे सामने आ रहे हैं, देश में आने वाले समय में बनने वाले राजनैतिक हालात की तस्वीर साफ होती जा रही है. भारतीय जनता पार्टी (BJP) के नेतृत्व वाला एनडीए (NDA) गठबंधन अब तक बढ़त बनाए हुए है, लेकिन उसका प्रदर्शन उसके चुनाव पूर्व किए गए दावे के मुकाबले बहुत कमजोर है. दूसरी तरफ विपक्ष के इंडिया गठबंधन (INDIA Alliance) का प्रदर्शन जताई गई संभावनाओं के विपरीत बहुत अच्छा है. इस चुनाव के रुझान विपक्ष के नेता राहुल गांधी (Rahul Gandhi), शरद पवार (Sharad Pawar), उद्धव ठाकरे, (Uddhav Thackeray) ममता बनर्जी (Mamata Banerjee) और अखिलेश यादव ( Akhilesh Yadav) का कद बढ़ाने वाले प्रतीत हो रहे हैं.\n\nएनडीए 400 से बहुत पीछे\n\nलोकसभा की सभी 543 सीटों के रुझान आ गए हैं. बीजेपी ने एनडीए के 400 पार जाने, यानी कि 400 से अधिक लोकसभा सीटें जीतने का दावा किया था, लेकिन वह 300 के अंदर ही सिमटता दिख रहा है. दूसरी तरफ इंडिया गठबंधन के बारे में कहा जा रहा था कि वह 200 सीटें भी नहीं जीत पाएगा, लेकिन वह रुझानों में 231 सीटों पर आगे दिखाई दे रहा है. चुनाव आयोग के मुताबिक दोनों मुख्य प्रतिद्वंदी पार्टियों में से बीजेपी 241 और कांग्रेस 99 सीटों पर आगे चल रही है. साल 2019 के लोकसभा चुनाव में बीजेपी को 303 और कांग्रेस को 52 सीटें मिली थीं.\n\nमतगणना में सामने आ रहे रुझानों से विपक्षी गठबंधन में कांग्रेस नेता राहुल गांधी, एनसीपी (शरद पवार) के नेता शरद पवार, शिवसेना (यूबीटी) के नेता उद्धव ठाकरे, तृणमूल कांग्रेस की नेता ममता बनर्जी और समाजवादी पार्टी के नेता अखिलेश यादव का प्रभाव बढ़ता दिखाई दे रहा है.\n\nराहुल गांधी के कांग्रेस के पुनरुद्धार के प्रयास रंग ला रहे\n\nराहुल गांधी के कांग्रेस के पुनरुद्धार के प्रयास रंग ला रहे हैं. पिछले चुनाव में कांग्रेस सिर्फ 52 सीटों पर सिमट गई थी. बीजेपी के देश को कांग्रेस मुक्त करने के नारे के बीच इस बार कांग्रेस 100 सीटों का आंकड़ा छू रही है और उसके नेतृत्व वाला इंडिया गठबंधन 231 से आंकड़े पर पहुंच गया है. राहुल गांधी केरल में वायनाड और उत्तर प्रदेश में रायबरेली सीट पर जोरदार बढ़त बनाए हुए हैं. साल 2019 में राहुल गांधी ने यूपी की अमेठी और केरल की वायनाड सीट से चुनाव लड़ा था. अमेठी में उन्हें स्मृति ईरानी से हार का सामना करना पड़ा था. हालांकि वायनाड में उन्हें 706,367 वोट मिले थे. मौजूदा चुनाव के रुझान राहुल गांधी के प्रभाव को बढ़ाने वाले हैं.\n\nजमीनी जननेता के रूप में ममता बनर्जी का व्यक्तित्व फिर उभरा\n\nपश्चिम बंगाल की 42 लोकसभा सीटों में से तृणमूल कांग्रेस 29 सीटों पर, बीजेपी 12 सीटों पर और कांग्रेस एक सीट पर आगे है. सन 2019 के चुनाव में टीएमसी को 22 और बीजेपी को 18 सीटें मिली थीं. इस बार टीएमसी की सीटें बढ़ती और बीजेपी की सीटें घटती हुई दिख रही हैं. चुनाव प्रचार में बीजेपी संदेशखाली केस को लेकर टीएमसी के खिलाफ आक्रामक रही थी. लग रहा था कि टीएमसी को इससे भारी नुकसान होगा, लेकिन स्थिति इससे उलट बनती दिख रही है. इन रुझानों से टीएमसी प्रमुख ममता बनर्जी का जमीनी जननेता का व्यक्तित्व एक बार फिर उभरता हुआ दिख रहा है.\n\nशरद पवार और उद्धव ठाकरे ने साबित किया नेतृत्व\n\nमहाराष्ट्र में 48 लोकसभा सीटें हैं. इनमें से इंडिया गठबंधन में शिवसेना (यूबीटी) को 10 सीटें, कांग्रेस को 12 सीटें, एनसीपी (शरद पवार) को 7 सीटें मिलती दिख रही हैं. एनडीए में 11 सीटें बीजेपी को, 6 सीटें शिवसेना (एकनाथ शिंदे) को और एक सीट एनसीपी (अजीत पवार) को मिलती हुई दिख रही है. एक सीट निर्दलीय उम्मीदवार को मिलती दिख रही है. इन रुझानों से यह साफ है कि इंडिया गठबंधन के हिस्सा शिवसेना (उद्धव ठाकरे और एनसीपी (शरद पवार) काफी ताकत के साथ वापसी कर रहा है. महाराष्ट्र में यह दोनों पार्टियां टूट गई थीं. उद्धव ठाकरे और शरद पवार को अपनी-अपनी पार्टियां खोनी पड़ी थीं और नई पार्टी के रूप में अलग दलीय पहचान के साथ मैदान में उतरना पड़ा था. इसके बावजूद इस चुनाव में उनका प्रदर्शन शानदार रहा है. इससे एक बार फिर शरद पवार और उद्धव ठाकरे ने अपने नेतृत्व का प्रभाव साबित किया है.\n\nअखिलेश यादव एक बार फिर दमदार नेता के रूप में उभरे\n\nउत्तर प्रदेश में लोकसभा की सबसे अधिक 80 सीटें हैं. माना जाता है कि जो लेकसभा चुनाव में जीत का रास्ता उत्तर प्रदेश से गुजरे बिना तय नहीं किया जा सकता. राज्य की 80 सीटों में से 35 पर समाजवादी पार्टी, 6 पर कांग्रेस, एक पर आजाद समाज पार्टी (कांशीराम), एक पर अपना दल (सोनेलाल), 35 पर बीजेपी और दो पर आरएलडी आगे है. राज्य में बीजेपी को भारी नुकसान होता दिख रहा है. सन 2019 में 62 सीटें जीतने वाली यह पार्टी इस बार घटकर 35 सीटों पर सिमटती दिख रही है. यानी उसको सीधे तौर पर 27 सीटों का नुकसान होता दिख रहा है. इसके विपरीत पिछले चुनाव में सिर्फ 5 सीटें जीतने वाली समाजवादी पार्टी इस बार 35 सीटें जीतती हुई दिख रही है. सपा के अध्यक्ष अखिलेश यादव इस बार दमदार नेता बनकर उभरते हुए दिख रहे हैं.\n\nयहां देखें चुनाव नतीजों से जुड़ी सारी अपडेट्स\n\n2019 vs 2024 : चुनाव परिणाम LIVE\n\nपूरी स्टोरी पढ़ें\n\nNDTV.in पर ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों को ट्रैक करें, व देश के कोने-कोने से और दुनियाभर से न्यूज़ अपडेट पाएं\n\nफॉलो करे:\n\nLok Sabha Election 2024 Results, INDIA Alliance, Rahul Gandhi",

INDIA अलायंस ने 37 सीटों पर लीड बना रखी है. सबसे बड़ा उलटफेर तो अमेठी सीट पर हो गया है. यहां BJP की स्मृति ईरानी (Smriti Irani) को कांग्रेस के किशोरी लाल शर्मा ने हरा दिया है. आइए जानते हैं कौन हैं किशोरी लाल शर्मा (Kishori Lal Sharma), जिन्होंने 2024 के इलेक्शन में स्मृति ईरानी को धूल चटाई है.\n\nअमेठी सीट पर स्मृति ईरानी को कांग्रेस के किशोरी लाल शर्मा ने हराकर पूरे देश को चौंका दिया. स्मृति की हार राहुल गांधी की पिछली हार से बड़ी है. वह 1.30 लाख वोट से हारीं हैं. किशोरी लाल शर्मा पहली बार चुनाव मैदान में उतरे थे. उन्होंने अपनी जीत को कांग्रेस पार्टी को डेडिकेट किया है.\n\n2009 के चुनाव के बाद पहली बार कांग्रेस रुझानों में 100 के करीब, पिछले 2 चुनावों से कैसे अलग है यह रूझान\n\nकौन हैं किशोरी लाल शर्मा?\n\nकिशोरी लाल शर्मा (KL Sharma) गांधी परिवार के बेहद भरोसेमंद हैं. 2024 के लोकसभा चुनाव में उन्हें 415450 वोट हासिल हुए. स्मृति ईरानी को महज 294581 वोट ही मिले. फाइनल डेटा अभी आना बाकी है. लेकिन वोटों के इतने बड़े अंतर से साफ है किशोरी लाल शर्मा जीत गए हैं.\n\nसमन्वयक के रूप में शुरू की राजनीतिक पारी\n\nकिशोरी लाल शर्मा मूल रूप से पंजाब के लुधियाना के रहने वाले हैं. उन्होंने 1983 में राजीव गांधी के साथ रायबरेली और अमेठी में कदम रखा था. 40 साल पहले पूर्व पीएम राजीव गांधी के साथ विधानसभा क्षेत्र समन्वयक के रूप में राजनीतिक पारी शुरू की थी. वह नेहरू युवा केंद्र में पदाधिकारी भी रहे. राजीव गांधी के निधन के बाद गांधी परिवार से उनके रिश्ते पारिवारिक हो गए. उन्हें कांग्रेस पार्टी का चाणक्य कहा जाता है.\n\nलोकसभा चुनाव रिजल्ट LIVE: यूपी-बिहार से लेकर राजस्थान-पंजाब तक... कौन से हैं वो 10 राज्य जहां फंस गई है BJP\n\nसोनिया गांधी के राइट हैंड\n\nराजीव गांधी की मौत के बाद जब सोनिया गांधी राजनीति में एक्टिव हुईं, तो किशोरी लाल शर्मा उनके राइट हैंड बन गए. इसके बाद 2004 में सोनिया गांधी ने राहुल गांधी के लिए अमेठी सीट छोड़ दी और खुद रायबरेली आ गईं. तब किशोरी लाल शर्म ने इन दोनों सीटों की जिम्मेदारी खुद पर ले ली. इस दौरान पार्टी ने उन्हें कभी बिहार का प्रभारी बनाया तो कभी पंजाब कमिटी का सदस्य बनाया.\n\nराहुल के हारने के बाद भी नहीं छोड़ा अमेठी\n\n2004, 2009 और 2014 के इलेक्शन में राहुल गांधी अमेठी से जीतकर संसद पहुंचे. 2019 के इलेक्शन में स्मृति ईरानी से उन्हें हार मिली. राहुल की हार के बाद भी उन्होंने अमेठी नहीं छोड़ा. किशोरी लाल शर्मा का कनेक्ट हमेशा लोगों के साथ बना रहा. वो अमेठी के लिए खड़े रहे और लोगों की मदद करते रहे. केएल शर्मा की अमेठी के हर गांव-मोहल्ले तक पैठ है. कांग्रेस ने इसी वजह से 2024 में अमेठी सीट पर उन्हें मौका दिया. किशोरी लाल ने भी पार्टी नेतृत्व को निराश नहीं किया. ये जीत हासिल करके उन्होंने स्मृति ईरानी से राहुल गांधी की हार का बदला भी ले लिया है.\n\nनीतीश, चिराग, चंद्रबाबू नायडू और जयंत चौधरी ने कैसे बचाई NDA की लाज, आंकड़ों से समझिए\n\nस्मृति ईरानी की हार के बड़े कारण:-\n\n1. कहते हैं सेल्फ कॉन्फिडेंस आपको ऊपर ले जाता है, लेकिन ओवर कॉन्फिडेंस उतना ही आपको नीचे ले जाता है. पूरे चुनावी कैंपेन में स्मृति ईरानी का ओवर कॉन्फिडेंस दिखा. वो हर मंच पर अपनी जीत को लेकर बड़बोले बयान दे रही थी और विपक्ष को कम आंककर देख रही थीं. इसका खामियाजा उन्हें मिला.\n\n2. BJP और स्मृति ईरानी दोनों अमेठी में अंडर करंट को समझ नहीं पाएं. BJP ने स्मृति ईरानी के खिलाफ किशोरी लाल शर्मा को बहुत हल्के में लिया. गांधी परिवार के प्रति आपत्तिजनक बयानों को लेकर लोगों में स्मृति ईरानी के लिए अंदर ही अंदर गुस्सा था. वोटिंग में ये गुस्सा दिखा.\n\n3. स्मृति ईरानी ने 2019 की जीत की खुमारी में वोटरों से दूरी बना ली थी. अमेठी वासियों का उनसे मिलना मुश्किल था. लेकिन किशोरी लाल शर्मा ग्रास रूट पर काम करते रहे. वो अमेठी के लोगों के लिए हर संभव मदद करते रहे. इससे लोगों का कनेक्ट बढ़ा.\n\n4. कांग्रेस ने अमेठी में टिकट का ऐलान करते समय सोची समझी रणनीति पर काम किया. नामांकन की आखिरी तारीख से 1 दिन पहले राहुल गांधी के टिकट का ऐलान हुआ. लेकिन ये अमेठी के लिए नहीं, बल्कि रायबरेली के लिए था. रायबरेली से बीजेपी ने कैंडिडेट का ऐलान कर दिया था. जबकि अमेठी में मालूम ही नहीं था कि कांग्रेस से कौन चुनाव लड़ेगा. स्मृति अपनी जीत को लेकर ओवर कॉन्फिडेंस में भाषण देती रहीं. लेकिन अंदर ही अंदर किशोरी लाल शर्मा अपनी तैयारी करते रहे.\n\nऐन वक्त पर जब कैंडिडेट का ऐलान हुआ, तो BJP और स्मृति ईरानी को चीजें भांपने का समय नहीं मिला. अमेठी को कई एक्सपर्ट वन साइडेड फाइट मान रहे थे. कांग्रेस ने यहां के मुकाबले को सबसे दिलचस्प मुकाबला बना दिया.\n\nनीतीश कुमार सबके हैं... शरद पवार ने की फोन पर बात, सम्राट चौधरी मिलने पहुंचे; RJD के ऑफर की भी चर्चा\n\nपूरी स्टोरी पढ़ें\n\nNDTV.in पर ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों को ट्रैक करें, व देश के कोने-कोने से और दुनियाभर से न्यूज़ अपडेट पाएं\n\nफॉलो करे:\n\nLok Sabha Election Result 2024, Amethi, Rahul Gandhi, Congress, Bjp",

        "body": "मेनका गांधी ने सुल्तानपुर से 2019 का इलेक्शन जीता था.\n\nनई दिल्ली:\n\nलोकसभा चुनाव के नतीजे (Lok Sabha Election Result 2024) कुछ घंटों में साफ हो जाएंगे. अभी तक के रुझानों में केंद्र में तीसरी बार नरेंद्र मोदी (PM Narendra Modi) के नेतृत्व में NDA की सरकार बनती दिख रही है. लेकिन BJP बहुमत से 30 सीटें दूर है. यानी BJP को सरकार बनाने के लिए सहयोगी दलों के भरोसे रहना होगा. INDIA अलायंस की हवा में BJP को यूपी में अच्छी-खासी सीटों का नुकसान हुआ है. BJP के कई नेता भी पीछे चल रहे हैं. इनमें स्मृति ईरानी से लेकर मेनका गांधी जैसे बड़े नाम शामिल हैं. मेनका गांधी सुल्तानपुर सीट से काफी पीछे चल रही हैं. शुरुआती रुझान से ही मेनका पीछे चल रही थीं. सपा के उम्मीदवार राम भुआल निषाद (Rambhual Nishad )26 हजार से ज्यादा वोटों से बढ़ बनाए हुए हैं. 10 लाख 30 हजार से कुछ अधिक पड़े मतों में से 4.50 लाख से ऊपर वोट पाने वाले की सिर पर जीत का सेहरा बंधेगा. मेनका गांधी (Maneka Gandhi) 9 बार चुनाव जीतकर संसद पहुंच चुकी हैं. लेकिन इस चुनाव में INDIA की हवा में उनकी हार करीब-करीब तय मानी जा रही है.\n\nसुल्तानपुर में 25 मई को छठे फेज में वोटिंग हुई थी. 55. 61% वोट पड़े थे. साल 2019 के मुकाबले इस बार 0.77 प्रतिशत मतदान कम रहा. बीते चुनाव की बात करें तो पुलवामा के बाद राष्ट्रवाद और मोदी वेव थी, बावजूद इसके मेनका गांधी को बड़ी मुश्किल से यह जीत मिल पाई थी. वो महज 14 हजार वोटों से जीत पाई थीं. उनकी जीत में निषाद, कुर्मी, यादव और दलित मतदाता निर्णायक थे. इस बार सपा ने सुल्तानपुर में निषाद कार्ड चला.\n\nलोकसभा चुनाव रिजल्ट LIVE: यूपी-बिहार से लेकर राजस्थान-पंजाब तक... कौन से हैं वो 10 राज्य जहां फंस गई है BJP\n\nएक तरफ सपा ने राम भुआल निषाद को उम्मीदवार बनाया. वहीं, बहुजन समाज पार्टी ने कुर्मी कॉर्ड खेलते हुए उदय राज वर्मा को खड़ा किया. संविधान बचाने, लोकतंत्र की रक्षा, बेरोजगारी और महंगाई का मुद्दा यहां भी छाया रहा. वोटिंग के दौरान ध्रुवीकरण भी हुआ.\n\nअभी तक के रुझानों में साफ है कि सपा प्रत्याशी राम भुआल निषाद वोटरों में बड़ा डेंट लगाते दिखे. उन्होंने इसके साथ ही सपा के कोर वोटर यादव मतदाताओं को भी बखूबी साधा. दूसरी ओर, बसपा ने कुर्मी वोटों पर डेंट लगाया. अंतिम समय में बड़ी संख्या में कुर्मी व दलित वोट भी गठबंधन के नाम पर डायवर्ट हो गए. ऐसे में यहां का मुकाबला दिलचस्प हो गया है.\n\nसुल्तानपुर संसदीय सीट की अपनी खासियत है. बीजेपी के देवेंद्र बहादुर एकमात्र नेता हैं, जो इस सीट से दूसरी बार सांसद चुने गए थे. उनके अलावा अब तक कोई ऐसा नहीं कर पाया है. यानी इस सीट पर किसी एक नेता को कभी दबदबा नहीं रहा. आजादी के बाद कांग्रेस इस सीट से 8 बार चुनाव जीत चुकी है. हर बार अलग चेहरा चुनाव जीतकर सांसद बना. बीजेपी को यहां 4 बार जीत हासिल हुई है. बसपा को 2 बार जीत मिल चुकी है.\n\nकल दिल्ली में होगी I.N.D.I.A. की बैठक : शरद पवार\n\nनीतीश कुमार सबके हैं... शरद पवार ने की फोन पर बात, सम्राट चौधरी मिलने पहुंचे; RJD के ऑफर की भी चर्चा\n\nपूरी स्टोरी पढ़ें\n\nNDTV.in पर ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों को ट्रैक करें, व देश के कोने-कोने से और दुनियाभर से न्यूज़ अपडेट पाएं\n\nफॉलो करे:\n\nLok Sabha Election Result 2024, Maneka Gandhi, Sultanpur Seat Results, Congress, Samajwadi Party Infighting",

        "body": "Loksabha Election Result 2024: लोकसभा चुनाव के लिए जारी मतगणना के रुझानों में भाजपा के नेतृत्व वाली एनडीए 290 से ज्यादा सीटों और INDIA गठबंधन 230 से ज्यादा सीटों पर बढ़त बनाता दिख रहा है। लेकिन पूर्व के अनुमानों के मुताबिक नतीजे नहीं आने की वजह से मंगलवार को शेयर मार्केट में भारी उथल-पुथल दिखी। इस दौरान सेंसेक्स में 4000 से ज्यादा और निफ्टी में करीब 1300 अंकों की गिरावट आई। जिसके बाद आम आदमी पार्टी के नेता और राज्यसभा सांसद संजय सिंह ने इस भारी गिरावट के लिए एग्जिट पोल्स को जिम्मेदार बताया। उनका कहना है कि एग्जिट पोल्स की वजह से लाखों लोगों का पैसा मार्केट में डूब गया। साथ ही उन्होंने एग्जिट पोल्स पर देश की जनता व संस्थाओं को भ्रमित करने का आरोप भी लगाया।\n\nएएनआई से बात करते हुए संजय सिंह ने कहा, 'देखिए पहले तो एग्जिट पोल्स जिन टीवी चैनल्स ने किया, और जिन सर्वे एजेंसियों ने किया, उन लोगों को इस देश की जनता से माफी मांगनी चाहिए। क्योंकि उनके एग्जिट पोल ने सबसे बड़ा हेर-फेर शेयर मार्केट में किया, जिससे आपने देखा कि शेयर मार्केट में कितने लोगों का पैसा डूबा और कितने लोग अरबपति-खरबपति बन गए। दूसरा काम क्या हुआ है कि प्रशासन तंत्र को, चुनाव आयोग को और जनता को भ्रमित करने का काम एग्जिट पोल ने किया।'\n\nआगे उन्होंने कहा, 'मैं पिछले तीन दिन से लगातार कह रहा हूं कि एग्जिट पोल के जो नतीजे दिखाए जा रहे हैं वो वास्तविकता से काफी दूर हैं। आपने 37% वोट शेयर तमिलनाडु में दिखा दिया, 14% वोट शेयर बीएसपी का यूपी में दिखा दिया। आपने INDIA गठबंधन का वोट शेयर तो यूपी में ज्यादा दिखाया, लेकिन सीटें कम कर दीं। एग्जिट पोल में ये हेरफेर क्यों किया? ये समझ से परे है। राजस्थान में 25 सीट थी वहां 33 दिखा दीं, हिमाचल प्रदेश में 4 सीट थीं, वहां 8 दिखा दीं, उत्तराखंड में 5 थीं, वहां 6 दिखा दिया। रामविलास पासवान के बेटे चिराग 5 सीटों पर लड़ रहे हैं, उन्हें 6 सीटों पर जिता दिखा दिया। इसकी पोल खोल कल ही हो गई थी जब मैंने ये सारे आंकड़े रखे थे।'\n\nमतगणना के आखिरी वक्त में गड़बड़ी की आशंका जताते हुए संजय सिंह ने कहा, 'ये वक्त बहुत निर्णायक है बहुत महत्वपूर्ण है, अंतिम समय में जब मतगणना हो रही होती है, उस वक्त छोटे-छोटे मार्जिन की जो सीटें होती हैं, 2 हजार, 4 हजार, 5 हजार की उसमें गड़बड़ी की बहुत आशंका रहती है। तो इसलिए INDIA गठबंधन के जितने भी दल हैं, उन सबके कार्यकर्ताओं से, प्रत्याशियों से मैं अनुरोध और विनती करूंगा कि अंतिम वोट गिने जाने तक, यहां तक कि VVPAT की पर्चियां और EVM की मिलान होने तक आप अपने समर्थकों और काउंटिंग एजेंट्स के साथ मतगणना केंद्रों पर डटे रहें। मैं समझता हूं कि ये नतीजे बहुत बड़े परिवर्तन का संकेत है।'\n\nएग्जिट से अलग आए नतीजे\n\nबता दें कि लोकसभा चुनाव 2024 के लिए सात अलग-अलग चरणों में मतदान हुआ था और 1 जून को हुए आखिरी चरण के मतदान के बाद जारी हुए एग्जिट पोल्स में एकबार फिर भाजपा के नेतृत्व में एनडीए की सरकार बनने का अनुमान जताया गया था। इस दौरान इन एग्जिट पोल्स में एनडीए को 400 के आसपास सीटें मिलने का अनुमान लगाया गया था। जिसके बाद शेयर मार्केट में भारी उछाल आ गया था। हालांकि चुनाव नतीजे एग्जिट पोल्स से बिल्कुल अलग आने की वजह से मंगलवार को मार्केट में भारी गिरावट देखी गई और लोगों को हजारों करोड़ रुपए डूब गया।",

        "body": "नई दिल्ली:\n\nलोकसभा चुनाव को लेकर मतगणना (Lok Sabha Election Result 2024) लगातार जारी है. नतीजों और रुझानों के मुताबिक, NDA 300 और इंडिया गठबंधन 230 सीटों के आसपास लीड करती दिख रही है. एनडीए और खासकर बीजेपी के लिए ये आंकड़े बेहद चौंकाने वाले हैं. 370 सीटों का नारा देने वाली बीजेपी को उत्तर प्रदेश से बड़ी उम्मीद थी. उन्हें लग रहा था कि 80 में से 72 से 75 सीटें वो जीत सकती है, लेकिन रुझानों से उसे बड़ा झटका लगा है. यहां बीजेपी इंडिया गठबंधन से पिछड़ती दिख रही है.\n\nउत्तर प्रदेश की 80 लोकसभा सीटों पर सबकी निगाहें टिकी हुई थीं. पिछले दो आम चुनावों में मुकाबला एकतरफा रहा था. बीजेपी ने प्रचंड जीत हासिल की. 2014 में बीजेपी ने 71 सीटें तो 2019 में 62 सीटों पर जीत हासिल की थी. लेकिन इस बार के चुनाव में बीजेपी काफी पिछड़ गई है. रुझानों के मुताबिक 80 में 37 सीटों पर बीजेपी, जबकि 42 सीटों पर INDIA गठबंधन बढ़त बनाए हुए है.\n\nपिछले दो लोकसभा चुनाव में शानदार नतीजे के बाद खासकर उत्तर प्रदेश में बीजेपी के हौसले बुलंद थे. राम मंदिर के उद्घाटन और रामलला की प्राण प्रतिष्ठा के बाद तो ऐसा लग रहा था कि बीजेपी यूपी में लगभग क्लीन स्वीप करेगी. लेकिन शायद अतिआत्मविश्वास और जनता की नब्ज पकड़ने में यहां बीजेपी नाकाम साबित हुई. बीजेपी को लगा कि हिंदुत्व और राम मंदिर का मुद्दा यूपी में सबसे बड़ा है, लेकिन विपक्ष के गठजोड़ और सामाजिक समीकरण साधने की रणनीति के आगे बीजेपी कमजोर साबित हुई.\n\nतकरीबन डेढ़ साल पहले इंडिया गठबंधन बनने और उसे असल शक्ल लेने में देरी को लेकर काफी सवाल उठाए गए. लंबे समय तक यूपी में समाजवादी पार्टी और कांग्रेस के बीच गठबंधन को लेकर उहापोह की स्थिति बनी रही, लेकिन अब रुझानों से ऐसे लग रहा है कि देर आए लेकिन दुरुस्त आए.\n\nउत्तर प्रदेश को लेकर बीजेपी सबसे आश्वस्त दिख रही थी. एक तरफ सबसे लोकप्रिय नेता प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी का चेहरा तो वहीं प्रदेश के मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ की कुशल प्रशासक की छवि, डबल इंजन की इस जोड़ी की बदौलत बीजेपी पिछले दो चुनाव की तरह इस बार भी बड़े बहुमत को लेकर पूरी तरह आश्वस्त थी, लेकिन जमीनी हकीकत को समझने में नाकाम और रणनीति में चूक की वजह से अपने सबसे मजबूत गढ़ यूपी में बीजेपी इंडिया गठबंधन से पिछड़ गई.\n\nइंडिया गठबंधन बनने के बाद भी बीजेपी ने जहां बिहार में जेडीयू तो वहीं उत्तर प्रदेश में आरएलडी के जयंत चौधरी को अपने साथ लिया, ताकि पश्चिमी उत्तर प्रदेश में एकमुश्त जाट वोट एनडीए के साथ आज जाए, हालांकि किसानों के बीच बीजेपी को लेकर नाराजगी थी और उसे खत्म करने के लिए बीजेपी ने हरसंभव कोशिश भी की. इसका उन्हें कुछ फायदा तो हुआ लेकिन उम्मीदों के मुताबिक नतीजों में नहीं बदल सका.\n\nउत्तर प्रदेश में दो लड़कों की जोड़ी ने बीजेपी का सामना करने के लिए साथ आना तय किया, और फिर सामाजिक समीकरण साधने की कोशिश के साथ ही अखिलेश यादव की पीडीए (PDA) यानी पिछड़ा, दलित और अल्पसंख्यक की रणनीति काम कर गई. बीजेपी के लगातार स्वार्थ का गठबंधन के आरोप के बावजूद सपा और कांग्रेस ने सकारात्मक मुद्दों के साथ चुनाव प्रचार किया और लोगों के बीच उन मुद्दों को लेकर विश्वास बनाने में सफल रहे.\n\nयूपी में 75 सीटों पर लड़ी थी बीजेपी\n\nबीजेपी ने इस बार राज्य की 80 लोकसभा सीटों में से 75 पर अपने उम्मीदवार खड़े किए थे, जबकि गठबंधन सहयोगी अपना दल (सोनेलाल) ने मिर्जापुर और रॉबर्ट्सगंज (सुरक्षित) सीट, सुभासपा ने घोसी और आरएलडी ने बिजनौर और बागपत से चुनाव लड़ा था. INDIA गठबंधन में शामिल कांग्रेस और सपा ने यूपी में साथ मिलकर चुनाव लड़ा. कांग्रेस ने 17 सीटों पर कैंडिडेट उतारे थे, तो वहीं बाकी सीटों पर सपा ने अपने उम्मीदवार खड़े किए थे.\n\nपूरी स्टोरी पढ़ें\n\nNDTV.in पर ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों को ट्रैक करें, व देश के कोने-कोने से और दुनियाभर से न्यूज़ अपडेट पाएं\n\nफॉलो करे:\n\nLok Sabha Election Results 2024, Lok Sabha Election Results In Uttar Pradesh, Lok Sabha Election 2024",

        "body": "केरल की वायनाड लोकसभा सीट के चुनाव नतीजे (Wayanad Lok Sabha Election Result) आ रहे हैं. अभी तक के रुझानों में कांग्रेस नेता राहुल गांधी आगे चल रहे हैं. इस सीट पर उनका मुकाबला BJP के प्रदेश अध्यक्ष के सुरेंद्रन और CPI की वरिष्ठ नेता एनी राजा से है. वैसे तो कांग्रेस और CPI राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर INDIA गठबंधन का हिस्सा हैं, लेकिन केरल में ये दोनों पार्टियां एक दूसरे के खिलाफ लड़ रही हैं. राहुल गांधी केरल की वायनाड के साथ-साथ उत्तर प्रदेश की रायबरेली सीट से भी चुनाव लड़ रहे हैं.\n\nअभी तक की मतगणना के मुताबिक, राहुल गांधी को साढ़े 5 लाख से अधिक वोट मिल चुके हैं. वहीं एनी राजा 2 लाख 46 हजार से ज्यादा वोट मिले हैं. के सुरेंद्रन एक लाख 28 हजार से अधिक वोटों के साथ तीसरे नंबर पर हैं.\n\nसाल 2019 के लोकसभा चुनाव में केरल की वायनाड सीट से राहुल गांधी ने बंपर जीत हासिल की थी. उन्हें 7 लाख से ज्यादा वोट मिले थे. उनका वोट प्रतिशत लगभग 65 था. इस चुनाव में CPI के पीपी सुनीर दूसरे नंबर पर रहे थे. उनके खाते लगभग 25 परसेंट वोट आए थे. उन्हें लगभग 2 लाख 75 हजार वोट मिले थे. वहीं भारत धर्म जन सेना के तुषार वेल्लापल्ली को लगभग 79 हजार वोट मिले थे. उनका वोट प्रतिशत 7 था. तुषार वेल्लापल्ली तीसरे नंबर पर रहे थे.\n\nवहीं अगर बात 2014 के लोकसभा चुनाव की करें तो कांग्रेस पार्टी के एम आई शानवास ने इस सीट से जीत हासिल की थी. उन्हें लगभग 3 लाख 77 हजार वोट मिले थे. उनका वोट प्रतिशत 41 था. दूसरे नंबर पर रहे CPI के सत्यन मोकरी को लगभग 3 लाख 56 हजार वोट मिले थे. मोकरी का वोट प्रतिशत 39 था. मोकरी करीबी अंतर से चुनाव हारे थे. वहीं BJP के पीआर रासमिलनाथ लगभग 81 हजार वोटों के साथ तीसरे स्थान पर थे. उन्हें लगभग 9 प्रतिशत वोट मिले थे.\n\nसाल 2008 में परिसीमन के बाद वायनाड लोकसभा सीट में अस्तित्व में आई. तब से यहां कांग्रेस पार्टी ही लगातार जीत रही है. वायनाड लोकसभा में 7 विधानसभा सीटें आती हैं. इनमें से 3\n\nवायनाड जिले के अंतर्गत, 3 मलप्पुरम जिले के अंतर्गत और 1 सीट कोझिकोड जिले में आती है.\n\nवायनाड लोकसभा सीट पर मुस्लिम समुदाय की आबादी लगभग 46 प्रतिशत है. वहीं लगभग 11 प्रतिशत आबादी ईसाई समुदाय की है. आदिवासी समाज के लोगों का हिस्सा लगभग 9 प्रतिशत है. वहीं लगभग 6 प्रतिशत आबादी एससी समुदाय के लोगों की है.\n\nये भी पढ़ें- क्या वाकई में वायनाड में राहुल गांधी के आगे कोई चुनौती नहीं?\n\nइस सीट के मुद्दों की बात करें तो राजनीतिक विश्लेषकों के मुताबिक, CAA का लागू होना यहां एक बड़ा मुद्दा है. साथ ही साथ स्वास्थ्य सेवाओं की कमी भी यहां एक प्रमुख मुद्दा है. इसके अलावा नीलाम्बुर और नंजनगुड के बीज रेलवे लाइन बिछने में देरी और मनन्थावडी और बावली के बीच हाईवे निर्माण भी दो बड़े मुद्दे हैं.\n\nइस सीट पर CPI की एनी राजा लेफ्ट डेमोक्रेटिक फ्रंट (LDF) की उम्मीदवार हैं. राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर LDF और कांग्रेस INDIA गठबंधन का हिस्सा हैं, लेकिन केरल में कांग्रेस UDF गठबंधन के तहत LDF से टकरा रही है. इस बारे में वामपंथी पार्टी CPM की दिग्गज नेता वृंदा करात ने फरवरी, 2024 में कहा था कि राहुल गांधी और कांग्रेस कहते हैं कि उनकी लड़ाई BJP के खिलाफ है, लेकिन वो केरल में आकर वामपंथ के खिलाफ लड़ रहे हैं. उन्हें खुद सोचना चाहिए कि वो क्या मेसेज दे रहे हैं.\n\nइधर, राजनीतिक विश्लेषक कहते हैं कि कांग्रेस के महासचिव केसी वेणुगोपाल, जो खुद केरल के कन्नू के रहने वाले हैं, वो ही राहुल गांधी को वायनाड लेकर गए थे.",

        "body": "लोकसभा चुनाव के नतीजों में बीजेपी को बड़ा नुकसान ( Image Source :PTI )\n\nLok Sabha Election Results 2024: अभी तो असली मंजिल पाना बाकी है, अभी तो इरादों का इम्तिहान बाकी है... बीजेपी के साथ भी कुछ ऐसी ही कहानी नजर आ रही है. लोकसभा चुनाव 2024 के नतीजे सामने आ रहे हैं, अब तक के रुझानों में विपक्षी दलों का INDIA गठबंधन एनडीए को कड़ी टक्कर देता दिख रहा है. आंकड़े इतनी तेजी से बदल रहे हैं कि अब तक ये भी कहना ठीक नहीं है कि एनडीए ही एक बार फिर सरकार बनाने जा रही है. विपक्षी दलों ने उत्तर प्रदेश और बिहार जैसे बड़े राज्यों में खेल कर दिया है. यानी बीजेपी को बड़ा नुकसान झेलना पड़ा है और वो खुद के दम पर बहुमत से काफी दूर है. ऐसे में अगर एनडीए बहुमत के आंकड़े को पार कर भी लेता है तो बीजेपी और पीएम नरेंद्र मोदी के सामने कई बड़ी चुनौतियां होंगीं.\n\nबीजेपी को कितना बड़ा नुकसान?\n\nसबसे पहले बीजेपी के नुकसान की बात कर लेते हैं. अब तक के रुझानों में बीजेपी 250 का आंकड़ा भी नहीं छू पा रही है. अगर यही रुझान नतीजों में बदलते हैं तो इस बार बीजेपी को करीब 60 सीटों का नुकसान होता दिख रहा है. सबसे बड़ी बात ये है कि अयोध्या में राम मंदिर के उद्घाटन के बावजूद उत्तर प्रदेश में बीजेपी और एनडीए को बड़ा डेंट लगा है. यूपी की 80 सीटों में से बीजेपी करीब 36 से 40 तक सिमटती हुई दिख रही है, वहीं समाजवादी पार्टी और कांग्रेस के गठबंधन को 40 से ज्यादा सीटें मिल सकती हैं.\n\nगठबंधन को बचाना पहली चुनौती\n\nजो नतीजे और रुझान सामने आ रहे हैं, उनसे साफ है कि बीजेपी को अब सरकार बनाने के लिए अपने सहयोगी दलों का हाथ थामकर चलना होगा. लेकिन राजनीति का इतिहास बताता है कि गठबंधन के साथी हाथ झटकने में बिल्कुल भी देर नहीं करते हैं, हवा अगर इंडिया गठबंधन की तरफ बहने लगी तो बीजेपी के सामने सबसे बड़ी चुनौती अपने कुनबे को बचाने की होगी. ये ठीक वैसा ही जैसे कुछ साल पहले कांग्रेस के साथ हुआ था. हालांकि बीजेपी का हाल तब की कांग्रेस जितना बुरा नहीं है.\n\nनीतीश बन सकते हैं किंग मेकर\n\nबीजेपी के बड़े सहयोगी दलों की बात करें तो इसमें बिहार के सीएम नीतीश कुमार की जेडीयू भी शामिल है, जिसे राज्य की 40 सीटों में से 15 सीटों पर बढ़त मिली है, वहीं बीजेपी यहां 12 सीटों पर सिमटती नजर आ रही है. जबकि बीजेपी ने 17 सीटों पर चुनाव लड़ा है और नीतीश की जेडीयू ने 16 सीटों पर उम्मीदवार उतारे थे. अब नीतीश कुमार पर सभी की नजरें टिकी हैं, अगर वो एक बार फिर पाला बदलते हैं तो किंग मेकर साबित हो सकते हैं.\n\nनीतीश कुमार के अलावा तेलुगु देशम पार्टी (TDP) ने भी आंध्र प्रदेश में बड़ा उलटफेर किया है, पार्टी कुल 16 सीटें पर आगे चल रही है. ऐसे में विपक्षी दलों ने चंद्रबाबू नायडू से संपर्क साधना शुरू कर दिया है. नीतीश कुमार की जेडीयू के बाद विपक्ष की नजरें टीडीपी पर ही टिकी होंगीं. इसी तरह एनडीए के बाकी दलों को भी तोड़ने की कोशिश होगी.\n\nबार्गेनिंग पावर होगी कम\n\nसाल 2014 के नतीजों की बात करें तो बीजेपी ने नरेंद्र मोदी के नेतृत्व में 543 में से कुल 282 सीटें हासिल की थीं. यानी खुद के दम पर बहुमत के पार पहुंच गई थी. इस दौरान बीजेपी के पास पूरी बार्गेनिंग पावर थी, यानी गठबंधन के साथियों का कोई भी दबाव नहीं था. इसके बाद जब 2019 लोकसभा चुनाव के नतीजे आए तो बीजेपी और प्रचंड बहुमत के साथ सत्ता में आई, पार्टी ने 303 सीटों पर जीत हासिल की. इस बार पार्टी का कॉन्फिडेंट सातवें आसमान पर था और बीजेपी ने बिना हिचके वो हर काम किया जो उसके एजेंडे में था.\n\nअब 2024 में भी बीजेपी को यही उम्मीद थी कि वो बहुमत के आंकड़े को पार करेगी और इस बार तो 400 पार का नारा भी दिया गया. हालांकि रुझान और नतीजे कुछ और ही कहानी बता रहे हैं. इन नतीजों का बीजेपी की बार्गेनिंग पावर पर काफी असर पड़ेगा. अगर एनडीए की सरकार बनती है तो बीजेपी को कई बड़े मंत्रीपदों पर समझौता करना पड़ सकता है. क्योंकि अगर किसी भी सहयोगी दल ने साथ छोड़ा तो सत्ता का सिंहासन हिलने लगेगा.\n\nबीजेपी के एजेंडे पर ब्रेक\n\nतीसरी सबसे बड़ी चुनौती बीजेपी के लिए उसके एजेंडे पर काम करना होगा. 2014 के बाद से बीजेपी ने अपने तमाम एजेंडों पर काम किया और उन्हें पूरा भी किया. अब पार्टी के एजेंडे में यूनिफॉर्म सिविल कोड (UCC), एक राष्ट्र एक चुनाव और जनसंख्या नियंत्रण कानून जैसे बड़े मुद्दे थे. अब जैसा कि रुझान दिखा रहे हैं कि बीजेपी को बहुमत हासिल नहीं हो रहा है, ऐसे में बीजेपी के ये सभी मुद्दे ठंडे बस्ते में जा सकते हैं. किसी भी एक मुद्दे पर बीजेपी को हर सहयोगी दल को साथ लेकर चलना होगा.",

It does not explicitly favor the INC or the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) either, but it does present the INC in a relatively positive light by noting its gains.\n\nGiven these observations, the most appropriate choice would be:\n\nD) None",
