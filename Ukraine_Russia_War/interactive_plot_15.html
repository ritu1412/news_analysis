Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shared an image of a damaged building on social media and urged international partners to take decisive actions against Russian aggression. Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko confirmed the casualties and infrastructure damage. Additionally, Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure with missiles and drones, marking the eighth significant attack on such facilities in three months. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed they targeted ammunition depots containing Western-supplied weapons. The ongoing conflict, which began on February 24, 2022, has divided global alliances, with NATO countries supporting Ukraine and nations like China and Iran indirectly backing Russia. India has maintained a neutral stance, advocating for an end to the war."],["**Summary:**\u003cbr \u002f\u003e\u003cbr \u002f\u003eRussian President Vladimir Putin is set to impose additional financial burdens on his country's wealthy population due to the ongoing Ukraine war. The Russian parliament has given preliminary approval to a bill that plans to increase taxes on the income of the rich. This move comes as Russia enters the third year of its conflict with Ukraine, despite pressure from the U.S. and Western countries. The bill, which passed its first reading in the State Duma, aims to amend the 2001 tax law by introducing a slab tax system. Individuals earning over $27,500 annually will see increased tax rates, with those earning above $573,000 facing a 22% tax rate. Additionally, corporate tax rates will rise from 20% to 25%. This legislation is expected to significantly boost Russia's revenue by $29 billion by 2025, highlighting the economic strain caused by the war and Western sanctions."]],"hoverinfo":"none","marker":{"color":"red","size":8},"mode":"markers","name":"Hindi","x":[-12.071734,-11.355117,-10.830694,-11.680962,-11.681139,-10.805749,-11.683906,-11.504132,-11.353704,-10.75758,-10.715115,-10.926372,-11.012182,-11.007144,-12.345845,-10.916111,-11.9062395,-10.595188],"y":[-7.6442146,-7.1473856,-6.7477355,-6.3507566,-6.3533816,-6.6241245,-6.352769,-6.284677,-6.227207,-6.5655155,-6.7265143,-7.039917,-7.2639756,-7.2639003,-6.917529,-7.0428042,-6.4509277,-6.928575],"type":"scatter"}],
