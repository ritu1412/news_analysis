        "title": "European Commission Competition Report Spotlights Potential Areas of Focus for Next Commissioner",
        "body": "Last week, the European Commission (EC) Directorate-General for Competition published a staff report on 'Protecting competition in a changing world: Evidence on the evolution of competition in the EU during the past 25 years'. We have read the report and believe that one can distill from it several principles that may guide competition policy in the next Commission:\n\nThe report appears to be the latest salvo in DG Competition's attempts to stave off dilution of its competition powers. The last significant part of this effort was passage of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation, which was borne in part out of a desire to avoid polluting competition policy with the political fallout which accompanied the Commission's block of the Alstom-Siemens merger (which was characterized as a merger of French and German \"champions\" to meet competition alleged to arise from government-subsidized Chinese manufacturers).\n\nThe report signals that the Commission's focus will be on the protection of competition and innovation competition (i.e., dynamic competition), particularly in sectors with existing high levels of concentration and clear signs of market power.\n\nThe report's conclusions in relation to lower income households and consumer-facing sectors suggest that these will be critical areas of focus for antitrust and merger enforcement going forward, with a potential goal of increasing the purchasing power of consumers to both reverse trends at the macro-economic level and improve competition. We expect that the EC may focus on these sectors in its enforcement strategy to send a message to other market participants.\n\nSpecifically for private equity deals, the report asserts that common ownership has been a structural driver for purported negative changes to competition, indicating a belief that common ownership (even at small minority levels) can influence competitive dynamics.\n\nWe do not expect any major changes in substance to the EC's approach in merger review. For antitrust enforcement, however, the report suggests a willingness to consider novel theories of harm whilst being open to discussion on effective remedies to protect innovation competition.\n\nBackground and summary of report\n\nThe Commission's report assesses the conditions of competition in the EU over the last 25 years and the main drivers of change, presenting new findings based on extensive economic research on the impacts on overall economic growth. The Commission draws on contributions from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a consortium of researchers led by economics consultancy Lear, and by the Chief Economist's team within DG Competition itself. It provides an update on the current factors affecting competition in the EU, the key drivers for this, and the impact of competition on economic outcomes.\n\nThe report, which was presented and discussed at a conference hosted by the EC on 27 June 2024, comes at a crucial political juncture for Europe. In particular, current European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will soon need confirmation from the European Parliament to renew her mandate. The vote is likely to be close. In exchange for supporting President von der Leyen, certain members of the European Parliament will likely seek concessions and there likely will be calls for a more interventionist industrial policy and more 'benign' enforcement of competition policy. These calls will likely be echoed in a report on European competitiveness expected to be issued by Mario Draghi (the former Italian Prime Minister and European Central Bank President) at the end of July. All of this will inform the selection of the next Competition Commissioner, the hearings in European Parliament of Commissioner-designates, and the EC's key policy priorities for the next five years. Indeed, there has already been mounting pressure to relax competition law enforcement in the next commissioner's mandate -- notably in the area of mergers, but also in relation to state aid. The report, however, may be one means by which current Commissioner Margrethe Vestager will try to resist this pressure.\n\nKey findings of the report\n\nOverall, the report finds weaker intensity of competition in the EU than in the past, with more pronounced market power and profit for firms at the top. However, the Commission caveats this with the finding that such weakened competition is still less pronounced than in other economies such as the United States.\n\nChanges to competitive intensity have been driven by both structural and institutional changes to how firms create value and compete in today's economy. The EC addresses how technological innovation, digitisation of business, public policies, and transformation in global supply chains (exemplified by China's re-integration into global trade) have changed the dynamics of trade and competition.\n\nThe second part of the report confirms and supplements prior findings that competition can have effects on prices and purchasing power of consumers, competitiveness of EU firms and overall economic growth. This is correlated to productivity, the most important factor for overall competitiveness and economic growth, with the research estimating that increased markups over the last 25 years might have reduced EU GDP by five to seven percent.\n\nThese key findings are discussed in more depth below.\n\nEvolution of competition\n\nThe report asserts that on average and in a wide range of sectors in the last 25 years:\n\nDrivers of evolution of indicators of competition\n\nAs changes to competition have been across many sectors of the economy, the EC suggests that the changes have occurred due to both structural and institutional drivers.\n\nStructural drivers. Structural drivers include rising investments in proprietary IT solutions and data, other intangible investments, globalisation, and changes to business conduct (i.e., M&A, oligopolistic pricing and behaviour, exclusionary strategies and common ownership by shareholders). In particular, the EC observes a link between access to intangible assets such as software and indicators of weakened competition.\n\n'Winner takes most' dynamics mean that large first-mover firms have been able to reap most of the benefits. The EC considers that this winner-takes-most framework initially enhances productivity growth. However in a second stage, it inhibits the process. That is, trends show that once a firm has established dominance through initial structural efficiencies, it then becomes easier to engage in exclusionary conduct, leading to high barriers for new entrants. During the EC's conference on the study on 27 June, Professor Nancy Rose at MIT Economics described this two-phase exclusionary behaviour as 'getting to the top and then pulling up the ladder behind you'.\n\nWhilst the rise in M&A and potential underenforcement are flagged by the EC, it doesn't attribute these to reduced competition.\n\nInstitutional drivers. Institutionally, the report observes regulatory barriers to entry and expansion contributing to these 'winner takes most' dynamics. In this respect, more vigorous competition enforcement in the EU as an institutional driver is attributed to less adverse effects than in the United States.\n\nRecent shocks to the EU economy are mentioned in the report, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine war, and rising inflation in the context of whether the EU competitive process is resilient and flexible enough to adapt to similar shocks in the future. However, no concrete conclusions are made.\n\nSpecific sectors of focus\n\nAcross 127 sectors, the report presents a scorecard of competition levels according to each sector's performance against the indicators of competition identified (i.e., concentration, mark-ups, profits, and measures of business dynamism). Having ranked each sector's degree of competition (according to the indicators), the report concludes that regulatory intervention has been most frequent in sectors with high competition risks based on the sectoral scorecard. Highest ranking on the scorecard include gas, telecoms, pharmaceuticals, rail transport, beverages, cement, and aerospace.\n\nAccording to the report, technological change and globalisation have had benign competitive effects on unconcentrated sectors or sectors where technological and business process innovations improve competition (for example, retail, car manufacturing and the manufacturing of semiconductors). At the other end of the spectrum, technological change and globalisation have, according to the report, led to a widening of the gap between leading firms and followers. Limited churn/dynamism at the top have been more detrimental to consumers in sectors such as consumer goods for household and personal care products, breakfast cereals, carbonated soft drinks, tobacco or beer, or in business-to-business sectors such as aircraft manufacturing, cement, and pesticides and seeds, according to the report. The report posits that sectors such as software and pharmaceuticals exhibit both benign and adverse consequences of such structural drivers, with technical progress simultaneously benefiting consumers but increasing barriers to entry.\n\nSeveral sector-based nuances bear mention:\n\nWhilst the EC has observed variances by sector, it has taken the view that intensity of competition in the EU is now weaker overall.\n\nImpacts on macro-economic trends\n\nThe Commission also considers effects on worrying macro-economic trends such as reductions in productivity growth, wage inequality, lower investments, and overall lower economic growth.\n\nMore effective competition resulting in lower markups, could have macroeconomic benefits in the reduction in price levels, increased household consumption and private investment, a strengthening of productivity and overall economic growth, according to the report.\n\nThe report estimates the weakening of competition since 2000 may have led to a five to seven percent drop in GDP, a four to five percent increase in prices and a one to three percent drop in productivity, with a potential worsened outcome by 25 percent were it not for EC interventions in the last 10 years. The report also estimates that implementing measures to limit market power of dominant firms may increase GDP by two to four percent.\n\nWhy competition matters for economic outcomes\n\nThe report posits links among competition, the competitiveness of companies and macro-economic trends, such that weakened competition harms productivity and long-term economic outcomes. The report also states that firms experiencing strong competition at a domestic level perform better globally, based on studies of successful export sectors. That is, domestic competition incentivises improvements to product quality, efficiency, and innovation.\n\nKey observations of the report's authors\n\nWe note the following key conclusions and messages in the Commission's report:\n\nSimilar findings, particularly in relation to increased concentration and its links to mark ups and profits, have been made in the United States, both by the Council of Economic Advisors in 2016 in their report 'Benefits of competition and indicators of market power' and the Chairperson of the Federal Trade Commission in 2018 in its contribution to the Quarterly Journal of Economics 'The rise of market power and the macroeconomic implications'. The 2016 report has since been cited by the Federal Trade Commission and the White House, including in the release of more stringent merger guidelines in July 2023.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority in the UK drew similar conclusions in its 2022 'state of UK competition' report, finding that the largest and most profitable firms are able to sustain their market position for longer than prior to the global financial crisis. This report notably conducted a more detailed analysis into common ownership and its effect on market concentration, and is similarly focused on end-consumer outcomes.",

Thank you American taxpayers,\" read sticker text on a photo of an invoice shared in a July 1 Instagram post.\n\nThe invoice shown in the Instagram post is to \"Mrs. Olena Zelenska\" for a preorder of a Bugatti Tourbillon with a total price of nearly $4.5 million.\n\nThe Tourbillon is a new car by the luxury automaker that will cost more than $4 million and won't be delivered to customers until 2026. But the invoice in the Instagram post isn't real.\n\nNicole Auger, a Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. spokesperson, told PolitiFact in an email that \"Mrs. Zelenska is not a Bugatti customer.\" Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, part of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, said in a thread on X that the claim is Russian disinformation that started in a French publication, Verite Cachee -- which translated to English means \"Hidden Truth.\"\n\n(Instagram post)\n\nEver since the U.S. began sending financial aid to Ukraine after the February 2022 Russian invasion, social media has been rife with claims that Zelenskyy and Zelenska have been using American tax dollars to fund a lavish lifestyle.\n\nAmong previous claims PolitiFact has debunked: Zelenskyy used American tax dollars to buy two yachts for $75 million (False); his net worth is $596 million (False); and that he bought a $35 million home in Florida (False).\n\nAuger said Bugatti normally doesn't disclose information about its customers, but it knew about reports that Zelenska bought one of its vehicles. This time, she said, Bugatti is making \"an exception because it is a false report.\"\n\nBugatti Paris, the official Bugatti partner in France, said in a statement posted July 1 on Instagram that the invoice was bogus and contained multiple errors, including the car's price, according to Meta's translation of the post.\n\nThe statement was from the Car Lovers Group, which owns Autofficina Parigi, the company that operates the Bugatti Paris dealership. The Car Lovers Group issued the same statement in a press release posted July 1 on its website. It said the company has filed a criminal complaint.\n\nThe statement referred to a video from a supposed Bugatti employee that was included in the Verite Cachee article and also shared separately in other social media posts. Analysts told CNN that the video has the markings of a deepfake, such as cuts in the video and strange mouth movements. The Center for Countering Disinformation also suggested it was generated with artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Verite Cachee website was created June 22 and many of the site's headlines are incomplete, with words such as \"Here is a short title for the article,\" according to a Google translation.\n\nOne article on the website about the Russia-Ukraine war appears to leave instructions on how to write the article with a pro-Russian slant.\n\n\"Here are some things to keep in mind for context. Republicans, Trump, DeSantis, and Russia are good, while Democrats, Biden, the war in Ukraine, big business, and pharma are bad. Feel free to add additional information on the topic as needed,\" the article's first paragraph said.\n\nThe Center for Countering Disinformation said \"Russian propagandists launched this fake before the NATO summit in order to discredit Ukraine's top leadership in the international arena.\" The NATO summit begins July 9 in Washington, D.C.\n\nAn Olena Zelenska Foundation spokesperson referred us to the X thread posted by the Center for Countering Disinformation.\n\nThe claim that Ukraine's first lady bought a $4 million sports car while visiting Paris with her husband is False.",

        "title": "Rocky Mountain Power proposes 30.5% electricity rate increase, points to fuel prices as culprit",
        "body": "Wind turbines generate electricity at the mouth of Spanish Fork Canyon on Sunday, Feb. 4, 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)\n\nRocky Mountain Power, the largest electricity provider in Utah, has filed an application to increase residential electricity rates in the state by 30.5%.\n\nIn its proposal to the state's Public Service Commission, the utility said the residential increase would be done in two installments, starting with one that would drive the average price of every kilowatt-hour from 10.96 cents to 12.89 cents, effective Feb. 23, 2025. Ultimately, the price would go up to 14.31 cents per kilowatt-hour on Jan. 1, 2026, according to a news release.\n\nBy Jan. 2026, households would be paying an additional average of $24.14 per month with the proposed hike -- an average $13.87 monthly increase per household under the first part of the rate raise, and an additional $10.27 per month from the second part.\n\nRocky Mountain Power cited increased costs of fuel and wholesale power, tied with ongoing new electric transmission and generation projects, for the rate increase. The company also mentioned escalation of wildfire risk insurance premiums as a significant reason to up rates.\n\n\"Like many businesses in these difficult economic conditions, the utility is facing inflationary pressures and increased costs outside of its control that cannot be offset through hard work and business discipline alone, making it necessary to seek a rate increase at this time,\" Dick Garlish, Rocky Mountain Power President, said in the release.\n\nFor non-residential Utah customers, the average kilowatt-hour would go from 8.18 cents to 9.5 cents on Feb. 23, 2025. Then, on Jan. 1, 2026, the company would further raise the 9.5 cents to 10.49 cents.\n\nThe goal is to increase rates to the overall amount of $667.3 million, the application reads, which would cover a base revenue increase of $564.9 million, in addition to $81.4 million for excess liability insurance and $21 million for amortization of deferred wildfire mitigation costs.\n\nIn a strong statement on his X account, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said he would work to make sure the proposal won't become effective.\n\n\"The proposed rate increase from Rocky Mountain Power would be laughable if it wasn't so dangerous. The proposal is completely unacceptable,\" Cox wrote. \"The audacity and lack of awareness with this request seriously calls into question management at RMP. I will do everything I can to make sure a rate increase of that magnitude never sees the light of day.\"\n\nHowever, this isn't a new approach for the utility. The company has proposed two-digit increases in other states it serves -- not always successfully.\n\nA proposal to raise rates by 29.2% fell through in Wyoming last year after Rocky Mountain Power acknowledged a major accounting error on its fuel cost calculations.\n\nAn agreement then allowed an increase of 5.5% for Wyoming customers which began in January and went up this month to 8.3%. The utility went back to the table in April to ask for an additional 12.3% rate increase, according to reports from WyoFile. The company later sued Wyoming regulators for the partial hike approval.\n\nResidential electric bills have remained fairly stable in the last decade, with annual bills for the average household only fluctuating slightly in the high $800 and low $900 range. Government officials have often cited studies ranking Utah as one of the states with the lowest electricity bills.\n\nBut that favorable ranking may change if rate increase of this size is implemented.\n\nThe largest drivers for the rate change are the \"significant increases in regional power and fuel prices,\" the application reads.\n\nMichele Beck, director of the Utah Office of Consumer Services, has seen an overview of the proposal and has experts looking at it. A full analysis of those calculations can only come after weeks or months of closer scrutiny, she said. But, as of now, she acknowledges that the drivers that are pushing the cost up are \"legitimate.\"\n\n\"The environment of the electric industry is changing very, very quickly. And so power costs are legitimately up. Investment in new resources raises rates,\" Beck said.\n\nHowever, while she was expecting a large number in the proposal, she was still surprised to see how large it was.\n\nSome of the factors Beck's office will also be evaluating include the cost for wildfire insurance and whether shareholders should take on some of that insurance risk -- as well as how the states that Rocky Mountain Power serves can share those costs, Beck said.\n\n\"Rate payers can be assured that there are multiple parties scrutinizing it, and we do get access to the data. It's just such a large number that even if we find mistakes, even if we say, 'not all of that should be included,' I feel like the end result will still be a large number,\" she added.\n\nMany factors are contributing to the increase in fuel prices, said Logan Mitchell, climate scientist and energy analyst at Utah Clean Energy. One is the Russia-Ukraine war, which has increased the prices of natural gas and coal. But there have also been issues with coal supply and demand that have been driving up the price of the resource.\n\n\"The (Cox) administration, the Office of Consumer Services, Division of Public Utilities, have an extraordinarily important role in this process,\" Mitchell said. \"But at the end of the day, much of these costs are coming from the cost of fuels, and so until we can invest in our grid and transition away from those, the most significant cost drivers, we're going to be stuck in a cycle of increasing costs.\"\n\nHowever, Rocky Mountain Power also notes those increased costs are \"mitigated by the company's investment in wind facilities and in the Gateway South transmission line, which allows for the deployment of additional capacity from Wyoming wind and coal resources.\"\n\nThe extra coal and natural gas expenses are also further alleviated by the utility's participation in the Western Energy Imbalance Market, which allows companies like PacifiCorp -- Rocky Mountain Power's parent company -- to buy and sell energy in real time, finding the cheapest alternatives. PacifiCorp saved more than $73 million during 2024's first quarter with this system, according to a Western Energy Imbalance Market report.\n\nFor Sen. Nate Blouin, D-Millcreek, who has worked in the renewable energy sector, it is \"reasonable to ask for those increases,\" he said. \"But to do it all at once is the frustrating piece.\"\n\nIn his view, the rate adjustment should have been done in a more sustainable way. He also doesn't see how Cox could counteract Rocky Mountain Power's ask, but hopes the commission is also ready to \"really give this a lot of scrutiny.\"\n\nAdditionally, though these calculations have included escalated costs for wildfire mitigation, the company may need additional insurance not yet included in the proposal. PacifiCorp hasn't fully considered how SB224, which establishes a catastrophic wildfire fund, will work either, so the cost can continue to go up, Mitchell highlighted.\n\n\"Our historic carbon emissions, including from our power company, are driving climate change, which is making wildfire conditions worse, which is driving up our electricity costs. So this is a direct cost of climate change that is now coming home to roost and affecting Utahns' electricity costs and rates,\" Mitchell said.",

        "body": "Gas prices could be about to get cheaper, just in time for summer road travel, as about 42 million gallons of gasoline makes its way into the fuel market.\n\nIn May, the Biden administration announced that the one million barrels of gasoline in the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve were up for sale. Contracts were awarded to five companies, and barrels were sold at an average of $2.34 per gallon. The gasoline was released to the contracted companies as of June 30.\n\nAmos Hochstein, deputy assistant to the president and senior advisor for energy and investment, says the release of gas should soon help drive down costs at the pump or, at least, prevent the price from increasing.\n\n\"It's not even oil -- it's a million barrels of gasoline directly into the gas market,\" says Hochstein, who is the leading expert and advisor to President Joe Biden on gasoline. By contrast, when oil reserves are released it still takes time to refine into gasoline. This action will move gas into the U.S. supply faster, but it's one that can't be done very often, says Hochstein.\n\n\"This is a one shot deal,\" says Hochstein, adding that it was timed before July Fourth to blunt the pressure on gas supply due to travel demands.\n\nFor context, 42 million gallons is about 11% of the total amount of gas that vehicles guzzle each day in the U.S., about 376 million gallons.\n\nLowering gas prices doesn't just benefit the average driver, it also means trucks that deliver supplies and food can run on cheaper fuel. Gas costs are factored into overall prices of goods, so cheaper gas can, theoretically, bring down prices -- or at least prevent them from going up.\n\nCheaper gas prices certainly can't hurt Biden, whose campaign is still reeling from last week's debate in which the president's performance was so poor it prompted a bevy of outlets to call for him to bow out of his bid for reelection. Presidents don't control gas prices, but they can enact policies related to drilling, refining and, in the case of today's news, releasing gas from reserves. Those actions can ultimately impact what drivers pay at the pump.\n\nGas prices have come down since hitting a peak in June 2022 when the average price for regular unleaded gas was $5.016, according to AAA, which tracks gas prices. As of today, the national average gas price is $3.501, according to AAA. It's up negligibly from last week's average of $3.469 and slightly lower than the average of $3.535 at the same time one year ago.\n\nThis release of gas should flow supply into gas stations during the Fourth of July rush. It'll primarily impact Northeast states including Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. But Hochstein says it could reach the Midwest, as well.\n\nThe Northeast will see cheaper gas because the barrels originate in the Northeast Reserve. \"When we sell this gasoline into the market, it loses value if you're trucking it across the country,\" says Hochstein. \"It is most valuable in the immediate area where it is in the Northeast.\"\n\nAverage gas prices tend to be highest out West with California ($4.790) leading the pack, followed by Hawaii ($4.702), Washington ($4.306), Oregon ($4.051) and Nevada ($4.035). On the low end, typical prices are found in Southern states led by Mississippi ($2.957), Louisiana ($3.028), Arkansas ($3.060), Oklahoma ($3.080) and Texas ($3.099).\n\nGas prices are set based on several factors including the price of raw crude oil -- more than half the price -- and the cost of refining that oil. The price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude is a bench market for oil prices in North America. Since its peak of $115 in the summer of 2022, West Texas Intermediate crude has fallen to around $83 today.\n\nToday's oil prices are influenced by global factors including the war between Russia and Ukraine and the war in the Middle East. Both areas producing oil and gas are under a lot of strain, says Hochstein. In 2022, following the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine, the administration announced a 180 million-barrel sale of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase gas supplies.\n\nBeyond oil and refining costs, gas prices also include a federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon and a state tax. On Monday, seven states hiked gas taxes.\n\nTiming of the release of this gas was critical, says Hochstein. That's because gas prices tend to go up during the summer largely due to several factors:",

        "body": "The recently concluded G7 summit demonstrated to the world that Europe and the United States are determined to deter the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia from further aggression, with sanctions introduced against Chinese entities, including financial institutions that provide economic impetus for Russia to maintain its war against Ukraine.\n\nIn the G7 communiqué released on June 14, \"China\" was mentioned a rare 28 times in its elaborating of the Chinese communist regime for threatening geopolitics and peace on issues such as production overcapacity, support for the Russia-Ukraine war, \"militarization, and coercive and intimidation activities\" in the South China Sea, and other issues.\n\nLeaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the European Union, warned the Chinese regime against its support for the Russian war, vowing in the statement to take \"measures against actors in China and third countries that materially support Russia's war machine, including financial institutions, consistent with our legal systems, and other entities in China that facilitate Russia's acquisition of items for its defense industrial base.\"\n\nLi Hengqing, a U.S.-based Chinese economist, told The Epoch Times on June 17 that this G7 summit has reached a consensus against the CCP, a focal point of interest different from the past summits.\n\n\"In the past, those Western countries more or less considering their economic, diplomatic, and political relationship with Communist China, have always dodged naming China (CCP), but this time the G7 has made a major change, sending a clear signal that 'if the CCP furnishes resources to the Russian war, then it will be made to pay a heavy price,\" he said.\n\n\"The U.S. is targeting the CCP as a counterpart bundled with Russia,\" said Henry Wu Chia-lung, macroeconomist and lead economics researcher at Taiwan AIA Capital\n\nMr. Wu shared during the New Tang Dynasty program \"Pinnacle View\" on June 18: \"The U.S. sanctions against Russia have gone through several rafts of escalation, and now they have been further escalated to expand the sanctions against Russia's financial system, including countries with which Russian banks have business dealings, with the obvious intention of targeting the CCP.\"\n\nIt included Hong Kong trading companies that \"route payments related to gold sales through foreign financial institutions back into the Russian financial system.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on key parts of Russia's financial infrastructure, including the Moscow Exchange, as well as its securities depository and the country's largest national clearing center.\n\nIn response, the Russian Stock Exchange suspended on June 13 trading in U.S. dollars and euros in foreign currencies and precious metals, as well as using these two currencies as financial instruments.\n\nOn June 13, the Russian central bank issued 14.2 billion yuan (about $1.96 billion) in loans to commercial banks in Russia for 174.2 billion rubles in a currency swap transaction. The day after, the bank doubled the limit of the currency swap to 20 billion yuan (about $ 2.76 billion).\n\nThe China-Russia Bilateral Local Currency Swap Arrangement was signed earlier in October 2014, when Russia was under sanctions by the West over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea.\n\nHowever, numerous agricultural and commercial banks in northeastern provinces bordering Russia, including Jilin Bank, Changchun Farmers' and Merchants' Bank, Changchun Development Bank and Yanbian Farmers' and Merchants' Bank, continue to provide \"a freer and more flexible settlement channel for border trade\" through the Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments System (CIPS) supported by China's central bank, according to multiple Chinese media reports.\n\nThe report said those banks shared ruble channel of Hunchun Bank's ruble channel, and \"given the transactions are mainly settled using the ruble as the currency, not the yuan, this system is outside the regulatory scope of the International Payment System (SWIFT) and won't be directly impacted [by the sanctions].\"\n\nIn this regard, Mr. Li indicated that these small banks are not directly connected to the SWIFT system, which does not mean that they can violate the U.S. and European Union bans and escape sanctions.\n\n\"If the Chinese Communist government continues to support Russia's war against Ukraine in this way, the West will eventually step in and impose sanctions on all Chinese banks. All Chinese banks are more or less state-owned, with shares linked to the Communist regime.\" Mr. Li said.",

        "summary": "The recent G7 summit concluded with a strong stance against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia, particularly focusing on deterring Chinese financial institutions from supporting Russia's war economy in Ukraine. The G7 communiqué mentioned China 28 times, highlighting issues such as geopolitical threats, support for Russia, and activities in the South China Sea. Leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, the US, and the EU warned China against aiding Russia, promising measures against Chinese entities that support Russia's defense industry.\n\nU.S.-based Chinese economist Li Hengqing noted a significant shift in the G7's approach, explicitly naming China and signaling severe consequences for supporting Russia. Henry Wu Chia-lung, a macroeconomist, emphasized that U.S. sanctions on Russia have escalated to include financial systems involving Chinese entities.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on key parts of Russia's financial infrastructure, leading the Russian Stock Exchange to suspend trading in U.S. dollars and euros. In response, the Russian central bank issued substantial loans in yuan to commercial banks.\n\nDespite sanctions, some Chinese banks in northeastern provinces continue facilitating border trade with Russia using the ruble, circumventing the SWIFT system. Li warned that continued support for Russia could lead to broader sanctions on all Chinese banks, which are largely state-owned."

        "body": "The lack of underground shelter space for protection during a nuclear conflict is prompting people to invest in private bunkers.\n\nThe \"scare factor\" from potential nuclear fallout, especially with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, is a major reason why individuals are preparing for the worst, according to Charles Hardman, who runs the company Subterranean Spaces.\n\nSome of his clients include energy company directors, Middle Eastern royalty, and European car company owners.\n\nHe said that fear of nuclear conflict, especially due to the recent Russia-Ukraine war was a major reason for bunker purchases, though a desire to showcase wealth also played a role.\n\nHe said that very wealthy people wanted \"to tick the box\" with a Ferrari, an Aston Martin, a house in Europe, and a house in the UK.\n\nBut now, a nuclear bunker is \"something they can tick the box with,\" he said.\n\nMr. Hardman, who also has quite a lot of inquiries overseas, in Europe and Saudi Arabia, said that demand had \"plateaued\" in England, in part due to the fact that news coverage of the Ukraine war has dropped.\n\n\"The only reason people call up is if they get worried,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the wrong time; it's too late then. These things take eight to ten months to a year to build. People should be preparing now. The whole of Europe is getting them done,\" he added, citing Sweden, Switzerland, and Germany as examples.\n\nThough he warned that in the UK there's no preparation. \"There's nothing,\" he said.\n\n\"Israel has to have a safe room for every property. China and Russia have built vast bunkers for their populations, and yet, in the UK, they're like, 'No, we don't need bunkers,'\" he said.\n\nMr. Thompson's company fills a niche by building smaller, more affordable bunkers, ranging from £20,000 to £150,000.\n\n\"You tend to have people who build bunkers for billionaires and millionaires, some of these are extremely lavish, with cinemas and swimming pools. But that's not what the everyday person can afford,\" he said.\n\nThough he said that the growing interest due to increased awareness of potential conflicts.\n\n\"More and more people are waking up to the fact that we are basically marching towards World War Three between NATO and Russia,\" he said.\n\nNuclear war followed by climate change were people's biggest concerns.\n\n\"We had them in World War Two, Anderson shelters, of course, they made a couple of million, but they did save millions of lives,\" he said.\n\nHowever he explained that the difference between now and then is that the humble World War II Anderson shelter was designed to offer British householders an afternoon of protection during bomb raids.\n\nBut in a fallout shelter, where you must hide from potential radiation, people may need to stay for two weeks or longer. Therefore, it has to be comfortable to live in, with sleeping quarters, cooking facilities, washing and bathing amenities, and entertainment and games etc.\n\n\"We had fallout from Chernobyl land in Wales, and we still have to scan the sheep today for radiation,\" he said.\n\nMr. Thompson's wife, a trained psychologist, provides video content to help people cope during crises in a potential bunker situation.\n\nHe said that planning permission is growing and depends on \"what area you live in and who you are.\" However, some clients may wish to remain tight-lipped about such a project.\n\n\"Do you want to advertise your bunker? Because when it all goes wrong, they are going to be in your bunker -- and if you've only built one for your family you can't support half the neighbourhood,\" he said.",

        "title": "Supreme Court's Broad Immunity Ruling May Empower Trump's Comeback",
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- In her dissent from a Supreme Court opinion that afforded former President Donald Trump broad immunity, Justice Sonia Sotomayor pondered the potential doomsday consequences: A president could pocket a bribe for a pardon, stage a military coup to retain power, order the killing of a rival by the Navy SEAL Team Six -- and be protected from prosecution for all of it.\n\nThe scenarios may sound part of an apocalyptic future. But the plain reality of the 6-3 opinion is that it ensures presidents have a wide berth to carry out official acts without fear of being criminally charged and it could embolden Trump, who was impeached twice and faced four separate prosecutions over the last year and a half, as he eyes a return to the White House.\n\nThe outcome is significant because Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has been public about wanting to pursue the same boundary-obliterating conduct that defined his four years in office, spawned criminal and congressional investigations and raised thorny questions about the scope of presidential immunity that were resolved largely in his favor in Monday's landmark opinion.\n\nRelated Story: Trump Says He Can End the Russia-Ukraine War in One Day. Russia's UN ...\n\n\"Over the long term, I think it will broaden what presidents are willing to do because they will see that there's a gray zone that the Supreme Court laid out,\" said Princeton University professor Julian Zelizer, who studies political history. The effect of the opinion, he said, will be to \"broaden the scope of what's going to be permissible\" and give presidents sufficient cover for acts that may veer into criminality.\n\nThe opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts did not dismiss the case charging Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential race, as Trump had desired, and it left intact the long-established principle that there's no immunity for purely personal acts. However, it significantly narrowed the case by finding that presidents enjoy absolute immunity for their core constitutional duties and are entitled to the presumption of immunity for other official acts.\n\n\"This is a full-throated endorsement of the unitary executive theory\" in a dramatic way, said Cornell University law professor Michael Dorf, referring to the theory that the U.S. Constitution vests extraordinary power in the presidency.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, the court's opinion means that the trial judge, Tanya Chutkan, must now engage in further fact-finding analysis to determine how much of the conduct alleged in the indictment from special counsel Jack Smith can remain part of the case.\n\nRelated Story: Manhattan Prosecutors Agree to Delay Trump's Sentencing\n\nImportantly for Trump, the one area the conservative majority said was unquestionably off-limits for prosecutors was his command of the Justice Department. That includes his directives to department leadership after the 2020 election to conduct what prosecutors said were \"sham\" investigations into bogus claims of election fraud, as well as his attempts to use the department's authority to advance his fruitless efforts to remain in power.\n\nThough the opinion doesn't make new law about the interplay between the White House and the Justice Department, Roberts affirmed that a president has \"exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials\" and may also \"discuss potential investigations and prosecutions with his Attorney General and other Justice Department officials to carry out his constitutional duty to 'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'\"\n\n\"I do think that this is a norm-breaking opinion and I can imagine Trump using this as a basis for a complete destruction of DOJ independence,\" said Boston College law professor Kent Greenfield.\n\nThe position from the nation's highest court is welcome news for Trump, particularly as he and his allies have suggested wanting to use the power of the presidency -- including, presumably, the investigative authority of the Justice Department -- to pursue retribution against political enemies.\n\nAfter his May conviction in his New York hush money case, Trump suggested he might try to retaliate against Hillary Clinton, his 2016 opponent, if he returns to the White House.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be terrible to throw the president's wife and the former secretary of state, think of it, the former secretary of state, but the president's wife, into jail? Wouldn't that be a terrible thing? But they want to do it,\" Trump said in an interview on Newsmax. \"It's a terrible, terrible path that they're leading us to. And it's very possible that it's going to have to happen to them.\"\n\nMore recently, he reposted a meme that suggested that former congresswoman Liz Cheney, who as the No. 3 Republican in the House broke ranks with her party and voted to impeach Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, had committed treason and should face a military tribunal.\n\nRelated Story: How to Get Voters the Facts They Need Without a Trump Jan. 6 Trial\n\nThe posts and comments raise concerns given how Trump's interactions with the FBI and Justice Department as president shattered longstanding norms and became central to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether he had obstructed an inquiry into potential Russia coordination with his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump urged his FBI director, James Comey, to an investigation into a close ally and fired him weeks later, berated his hand-picked attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for having recused himself from the Russia investigation and also sought the termination of Mueller.\n\nIn his report, Mueller did not conclude whether Trump had illegally obstructed the investigation, in part, because of a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents cannot be indicted. But he did say that presidents were not \"categorically and permanently\" immunized for obstructing justice by using their presidential power.\n\nTo be sure, there are safeguards still in place that could prevent most presidents from testing the limits of criminal immunity.\n\nThe threat of impeachment by Congress remains -- Trump was impeached over a call with Ukraine's leader and Jan. 6, but acquitted by the Senate -- as do the practices, protocols and norms that govern Washington bureaucracy.\n\nRoberts, for one, sought in his majority opinion to downplay the impact, saying Sotomayor was striking \"a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the Court actually does today.\"\n\nBut even if the scope of presidential power is not directly expanded by the opinion, there's no question that it could benefit any president determined to abuse those powers.\n\n\"Not every president will take advantage, but the lesson, I think, of Donald Trump is: one might,\" Zelizer said. \"Or the lesson of Richard Nixon is: one might. And the 'one mights' are the lessons that you're looking for.\"",

        "body": "The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released data for May 2024 global passenger demand with the following highlights:\n\n\"Strong demand for travel continues with airlines posting a 10.7% year-on-year increase in travel for May. Airlines filled 83.4% of their seats, a record for the month. With May ticket sales for early peak- season travel up nearly 6%, the growth trend shows no signs of abating. Airlines are doing everything they can to ensure smooth journeys for all travelers over the peak northern summer period. But our expectations of air navigation service providers (ANSPs) are already being tested. With 5.2 million minutes of air traffic control delays racked up in Europe even before the peak season begins, it is clear that Europe's ANSPs have unresolved challenges. And the 32,000 flight delays over the Memorial Day weekend in May show that challenges persist in the US too. Airlines are accountable to their customers; ANSPs must be as well. ANSP performance matters to their airline customers and to millions of travelers. We all need them to do their job efficiently,\" said Willie Walsh, IATA's director general.\n\nRegional Breakdown - International Passenger Markets\n\nAll regions showed strong growth for international passenger markets in May 2024 compared to May 2023. The load factor increased in all regions except North America.\n\nAsia-Pacific airlines continue to lead the way, with a 27.0% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 26.0% year-on-year and the load factor rose to 81.6% (+0.6ppt compared to May 2023). This performance maintains Asian carriers as the largest contributor to\n\nindustry-wide growth in May, accounting for 42% of the year-on-year increase.\n\nEuropean carriers saw an 11.7% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 11.3% year-on-year, and the load factor was 84.7% (up 0.3ppt compared to May 2023).\n\nMiddle Eastern airlines saw a 9.7% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 9.0% year-on-year and the load factor increased 0.5ppt to 80.7% compared to May 2023. Asian routes to the Middle East are particularly strong, now standing some 32% higher than in 2019. Another notable development is the Europe-Middle East route, which saw an April-May RPK increase for two years in a row, reversing the previous historic pattern of a decline between these months. In the coming months, it will become clearer to what extent these trends could be related to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nNorth American carriers saw an 8.1% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 9.7% year-on-year, and the load factor fell to 84.0% (-1.2ppt compared to May 2023).\n\nLatin American airlines saw a 15.9% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity climbed 14.3% year-on-year. The load factor rose to 85.1% (+1.2ppt compared to May 2023), the highest among the regions.\n\nAfrican airlines saw a 14.1% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity was up 8.2% year- on-year. The load factor rose to 72.3% (+3.7ppt compared to May 2023). This was the fastest increase in load factor among all regions, although Africa still has the lowest load factor overall.\n\nDomestic Markets\n\nDomestic demand increased at a stable pace in May. China's growth rate surged in line with the post- Labor Day holidays. Japan declined -1.8% possibly reflecting low business and consumer confidence.",

        "body": "STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul 3, 2024--\n\nInformation Services Group ( ISG ) (Nasdaq: III ), a leading global technology research and advisory firm, has launched a research study examining services and solutions providers helping oil and gas companies digitally transform to improve operational efficiency and prepare for future energy needs.\n\nThe study results will be published in a comprehensive series of ISG Provider Lens™ reports, called Oil and Gas Industry -- Services and Solutions, scheduled to be released in December. Two regional reports - one covering the North America market and the other Europe - will evaluate services including enterprise asset management, next-gen information technology and operational technology (IT/OT) services, data management and cloud computing, and energy transition services.\n\nEnterprise buyers will be able to use information from the report to evaluate their current vendor relationships, potential new engagements and available offerings, while ISG advisors use the information to recommend providers to the firm's buy-side clients.\n\nTechnological advancements continue to play a transformative role in the oil and gas industry. Increasing demand for IoT, data analytics and AI, especially generative AI (GenAI), is expected in the next two years. These technologies are poised to optimize production processes, improve equipment maintenance through predictive analytics and enable remote monitoring for increased safety and efficiency.\n\nOil and gas companies are also seeking technology solutions to support decarbonization strategies and energy transition. Governments are enacting stricter regulations to combat climate change, with policies such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the proposed European Net-Zero Industry Act driving companies to reduce emissions. Such regulations necessitate a shift in capital allocation, with investments flowing toward clean and green processes such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen production and renewable energy integration.\n\nIn addition, geopolitical events are altering global energy trade patterns. The impact of factors such as the Russia-Ukraine war on energy security and potential realignments in trade routes still remain a challenge for the industry.\n\n\"The oil and gas industry is facing a highly complex environment,\" said Iain Fisher, director of ISG Provider Lens Research. \"While fossil fuels remain a significant energy source, the winds of change are undeniable. Geopolitical tensions, the ongoing push for energy security and the relentless march toward a low-carbon future are all shaping the industry landscape.\"\n\nFor the study, ISG has distributed surveys to 37 providers of oil and gas industry services and solutions. Working in collaboration with ISG's global advisors, the research team will produce four quadrants representing the services and solutions the typical oil and gas company is buying based on ISG's experience working with its clients. The four quadrants are:\n\nEnterprise Asset Management, evaluating services and solutions providers that help oil and gas companies optimize the performance and utilization of assets throughout their lifecycle, increase production uptime and reduce operational costs.Next-Gen IT/OT Services, covering service providers that help clients in the oil and gas industry increase efficiency, ensure compliance and minimize overall costs, with offerings including infrastructure services, application development and maintenance (ADM), IoT-based solutions, cybersecurity, remote monitoring, digital twins and more.Data Management and Cloud Computing, covering providers of cloud data and process management, storage, application and master data management services to the oil and gas industry, enabling centralization of data and processes and transition from legacy systems.Energy Transition Services, evaluating providers offering services helping oil and gas companies achieve net-zero carbon transition targets, implement energy efficiency initiatives, and drive new business models for the evolving energy ecosystem.\n\nGeographically focused reports from the study will cover the global oil and gas technology market and examine products and services available in North America and Europe. ISG analysts Harish B (North America) and Mohd Aves Malik (Europe) will serve as authors of the reports.\n\nA list of identified providers and vendors and further details on the study are available in this digital brochure. Companies not listed as oil and gas service and solution providers can contact ISG and ask to be included in the study.\n\nAll 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ evaluations feature expanded customer experience (CX) data that measures actual enterprise experience with specific provider services and solutions, based on ISG's continuous CX research.

        "body": "Militaries around the world are beginning to restructure how they train their soldiers as methods of war continue to evolve in the high-intensity warfare environment demonstrated in the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nMost recently, the US Department of Defense awarded a $14.26m contract to Alutiiq Solutions on 1 July 2024. The company will provide I Expeditionary Operations Training Group (I EOTG) the ability to teach \"select special skills\" to US Marine Corps expeditionary units.\n\nI EOTG currently uses contractor personnel to provide the specialised training needed to deploy forces such as Maritime Raid Force training, sniper training, and uncrewed aerial vehicle training in order to prepare I Marine Expeditionary Force, Marine Expeditionary Units, Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Forces, combat advisors, and other designated deploying forces to support geographic combatant commands.\n\nJust as the Army has committed to changing its equipment and platforms best suited for counter-insurgency warfare to meet the needs of frontline infantry in a more direct conflict with near-peer powers, this must be reflected in how soldiers operate.\n\nThe contract will also see the contractor \"conduct and evaluate the collective training\" of the Marine Corps.\n\nThis commitment to evaluate soldier training demonstrates the changing face of warfare as infantry will need to change the way they fight to confront new innovations such as uncrewed systems, artificial intelligence (AI) and, in some cases, space-based assets.\n\n\"When everyone has all the equipment - both the Ukrainians and the Russians have jets, air defence, armoured vehicles - what really makes the deciding factor is the quality of the people, the actual human soldier,\" argued GlobalData Defence Analyst Tristan Sauer.\n\nThis comes down to Western training principles where responsibility trickles down to the lower levels of infantry, giving frontline soldiers a greater level of independence and decision-making.\n\nSauer added that this is where \"the divide comes between the quality of the Russian and Ukrainian forces,\" and this was true throughout most of 2022 and early 2023. \"But no one stays stupid forever when they're losing people\" on such a vast scale.\n\nControlling drones for all these people used to be the remit of the commander but we now realise that is no longer tenable. When you take out that commander, you take out that drone and a hundred people do not have coverage. So, the idea is that every small squad needs to have its own systems and the batteries to power them; it is important to promote self-sufficiency.\n\nBack in the West, the British Army has implemented a new vision for training its soldiers, known as the 'Land Training System' (LTS). This new structure aims to cultivate the sub-unit level with a wide range of skills and competencies in a combined arms environment.\n\nLTS is a programme partitioned into three development phases: Tradewind, Cyclone and Storm.\n\nTradewind will hone the skills and competencies of troops, with the aim of making training more self-sustaining; Cyclone involves building teams in which a sub-unit trains together (in a ten week timeframe every year) to master individual and collective skills; while Storm constitutes the scale and mass of 21 century fighting.\n\nThe Army aims to 'cyclone' 70% of its personnel by next year; and by 2027, the service will have fewer courses and more blended learning.",

        "body": "In a recent development, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on former U.S. President Donald Trump to reveal his plan for a swift end to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nWhat Happened: Zelenskyy, during a Wednesday interview, urged Trump to unveil his strategy for a rapid conclusion to the war, stressing that any plan must respect Ukraine's sovereignty, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.\n\n\"If Trump knows how to finish this war, he should tell us today,\" Zelenskyy asserted.\n\nTrump, who is leading in the polls over President Joe Biden for the upcoming November election, has promised to end the war by his potential inauguration in January. He criticized the billions spent on Ukraine's defense during a recent televised debate, claiming that Kyiv is \"not winning the war.\"\n\nSee Also: Elon Musk Calls Out New Yorker Piece Criticizing Joe Biden: 'So Many Dem Knives In Biden's Back Right Now\n\nZelenskyy expressed his willingness to meet with Trump to discuss his team's proposals. He also voiced his concerns about the delays in weapon deliveries from Western allies.\n\n\"They can't plan my life and life of our people and our children,\" he said.\n\n\"We want to understand whether in November we will have the powerful support of the U.S., or will be all alone.\"\n\nWhy It Matters: Zelenskyy's call to Trump comes in the wake of a series of events. In April, Zelenskyy had shown openness to Trump's suggestions for ending the war, stating that he would \"with pleasure\" consider Trump's ideas. In June, Trump's advisors proposed a strategy to end the conflict, which Trump reportedly responded positively to.\n\nIn a recent move, NATO has planned to \"Trump-proof\" Ukraine aid after Biden's weak debate performance with a $40B annual financial pledge and a new post in Kyiv. This move is aimed at safeguarding Ukraine's potential future NATO membership and countering the impact of a potential return of Trump.\n\nRead Next: Trump Ally Steve Bannon Says Biden Withdrawl Could Upend GOP Campaign, Describes First Debate As 'Pyrrhic Victory' For Ex-President\n\nPhoto by Dmytro Larin on Shutterstock\n\nThis story was generated using Benzinga Neuro and edited by Pooja Rajkumari\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",

The President was helped off the stage by his wife Jill after clashing with his Republican rival on topics including immigration, abortion rights and the Russia-Ukraine war. Biden's physical state and raspy voice drew scrutiny from both sides of the aisle, with one CNN panelist later claiming there was \"very aggressive panic\" among Democrats. Some in the party also cast doubt on whether Biden should be their candidate in November.

        "body": "China's economic woes, centered around a protracted crisis in the property market, have created an impression that weak real activity will show up in softer imports of key commodities. The reality, however, turned out to be the opposite, with the country now a key driver of global commodities demand, JPM Commodities Research said.\n\nIn stark contrast to the wider, faltering macroeconomic growth in the country, the imports of commodities by the world's second-biggest economy surged 16% in 2023, and staged a strong start to 2024, rising 6% in the first five months of the year, the investment bank said.\n\nThe trend, according to JPM, started in 2018 because of growing trade tensions during the Trump administration, but accelerated in 2022 with the start of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nAccording to JPM, China consumes almost 40% of the world's commodities, up from 23% in 2006, and is highly dependent on energy imports, shipping from abroad more than 70% of its crude oil feedstock and 40% of natural gas.\n\nETFs: (NYSEARCA:USO), (BNO), (UCO), (SCO), (USL), (DBO), (DRIP), (GUSH), (NRGU), (USOI), (NYSEARCA:UNG), (BOIL), (KOLD), (UNL), (FCG).\n\nNearly 80% of the raw materials needed to feed China's copper demand is sourced from overseas while raw material import dependence for aluminum and nickel currently sits around 65% and 95%, respectively, too, JPM analysts noted.\n\nAnalysts further argue, although China is a dominant player in global processing of commodities, it lacks sufficient upstream resources to satisfy its demand needs and its ability to control the value chain for major raw commodities has been historically limited.\n\nAdditionally, even as China accounted for 60% of the global EV sales in 2023, it relies on foreign suppliers for materials needed to make them, the brokerage added.\n\nElectric vehicle stocks with a presence in China: NIO (NIO), Li Auto (LI), XPeng (XPEV), ZEEKR Intelligent (ZK), BYD Company (OTCPK:BYDDF), Kandi Technologies (KNDI), Tesla (TSLA).\n\nThe brokerage further estimates, China's natural gas storage capacity will reach 85 Bcm by 2030 (16% of demand) on par with the U.S. that has around 130 Bcm of storage capacity, capable of holding about 15% of total U.S. demand. China's grain storage capacity is in line with that in the U.S.",

        "body": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A visit to Russia by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, expected within days, could help dispel worries that New Delhi is getting too close to the West and further away from Moscow, ceding space to China, analysts said.\n\nNo dates have yet been set for the visit, although it has been confirmed by both sides. Indian media said Modi will be in Moscow next week, around the time of a NATO summit in Washington, at which Ukraine will be one of the main issues.\n\nWhile the West has tried to isolate Putin, China, India and powers in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America have continued to build ties, with official figures showing rising trade with Russia.\n\n\"It will be a good opportunity for Moscow to project in the media the image of President Putin receiving a leader of a country like India in the context of the Washington summit,\" said Aleksei Zakharov, a Moscow-based expert on India.\n\n\"India's objective is to ensure that Russia is not in China's corner and that, even if it does not explicitly support India, it maintains a permanent neutrality in the India-China territorial disputes.\"\n\nTies between India and China have been frosty since a deadly border war in 2020.\n\nThe leaders of Russia and India have held annual summits since 2000 but the last in-person meeting was in 2021, when Putin visited Delhi.\n\nThe next meeting had been due in Moscow in 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, but it did not happen, while Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping elevated their ties, pledging a \"new era\" of partnership in May.\n\nThe two are meeting at a security summit on Wednesday in Kazakhstan, to which Modi has sent his foreign minister.\n\nIndia has also been seeking to distance itself from its largest arms supplier, Russia, as the Ukraine war hobbled the latter's ability to supply munitions and spares.\n\nThe dearth of Modi's visits to Moscow had given \"rise to speculation that there was some kind of drift in the Indo-Russia relationship,\" said analyst Nandan Unnikrishnan, of the Observer Research Foundation think tank in New Delhi.\n\n\"So I think Modi's visit will put an end to that kind of speculation,\" he said. \"And we don't want to spoil our relationship with any party, whether it's Russia, the United States, or anyone because of another relationship.\"\n\nIndia's foreign ministry declined to comment.\n\nAt a regular press conference last week, it said, \"We have a very well established bilateral summit arrangement with the Russian Federation ... and are also preparing to hold the next summit.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Kremlin said deepening trade and economic ties would be a key theme of Modi's visit which was in the \"final stage\" of preparation.\n\nSpokesperson Dmitry Peskov said regional security and global security issues always figured high on the agenda of such meetings.\n\nIndia, which has stepped up purchases of Russian oil shunned by the West, is expected to seek a discount higher than the current rate of $3 to $3.5 a barrel during the visit, sources said.\n\nIt will also seek formal approval for a unit of Oil and Natural Gas Corp to retain its stake of 20% in the Sakhalin 1 oil project in Russia's far east.\n\nThe unit, ONGC Videsh, and the oil ministries of India and Russia, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIndia has also been keen to boost exports of pharmaceutical, machinery and other goods to Russia. Two-way trade jumped 33% to $65.7 billion in the last fiscal year that ended in March, with India's imports accounting for $61.43 billion.\n\n(Reporting by Krishna N.

        "body": "As Chinese military aircraft and vessels continue their daily operations around Taiwan, China issued a no-sail zone warning in waters near the self-ruled island on Tuesday, the latest show of force by Beijing amid tensions in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nMaritime Safety Administration of China's eastern Zhejiang province issued a navigational warning for a \"military exercises\" in the East China Sea from Wednesday to Friday.\n\nNewsweek's map shows the boundaries of the declared danger zone in the waters east of Zhejiang and south of Shanghai, however large parts of the area fall within Taiwan's air defense identification zone, or ADIZ, and roughly 11 miles from the Taiwan Strait's median line.\n\nChina's leaders claim the island as part of Chinese territory despite Taipei's repeated rejections. Beijing has employed a mixture of military, economic, and psychological pressure against the island in service of its goal of eventual unification.\n\nAn ADIZ is self-declared airspace over land or water, in which the ready identification, location and control of aircraft is required in the interest of national security. But the zones -- also used by neighboring China, South Korea, Japan and the Philippines -- does not constitute territorial airspace and is not governed under international law.\n\nChina's military deployed 22 aircraft and six vessels around Taiwan in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. on Wednesday, according to the Defense Ministry in Taipei.\n\nOn X (formerly Twitter), one observer of the Chinese military noted that the no-go zone, while large, was declared for a short duration.\n\n\"A wild guess would be that it is probably going to be the first catapult take-off test\" of China's third aircraft carrier Fujian, according to user @foolsball, who added that the area resembled a \"big finger pointing\" to the Taiwan Strait.\n\nOn Monday, a separate navigational warning issued by Shanghai's maritime safety authority suggested the Fujian, China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, was due to conduct another sea trial in the East China Sea two days later, near the entrance of the Yangtze River.\n\nThe Fujian conducted its first sea trial on May 1. The flat-top warship is China's first carrier capable of catapult-assisted take-off, whereas its two other carriers, both of Soviet design, launch aircraft with ski-jump ramps.\n\nSatellite images showed the Fujian had returned to an outfitting dock on Tuesday. @foolsball speculated that it could be unloading aircraft mock-ups before sea trials.\n\nNewsweek could not independently verify the authenticity of the image.\n\nChina's Defense Ministry did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nLu Li-Shih, a former instructor at Taiwan's Naval Academy, said in a Facebook post that the upcoming sea trial would help the Fujian improve shortcomings identified in its previous test.\n\nHe also believed that the carrier would conduct so-called \"touch-and-go\" landing with aircraft for this round of trials, while actual landing on the flight deck would wait until the next test.\n\nTaiwan's armed forces will conduct live-fire exercises from July 22-26 as part of the 40th edition of its annual Han Kuang war games. Lessons learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war will be incorporated in live-fire drills, according to Taiwanese Maj. Gen. Tung Chi-Hsing.\n\nIn response, Beijing slammed the Han Kuang exercise as a \"show,\" in which independence supporters in Taiwan are doomed to defeat. The \"ending cannot be changed,\" the Chinese Defense Ministry said in its monthly press conference in late June.",

        "summary": "China has issued a no-sail zone warning in waters near Taiwan, citing military exercises in the East China Sea from Wednesday to Friday. This area overlaps with Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and is close to the Taiwan Strait's median line. The warning coincides with increased Chinese military activity around Taiwan, including the deployment of 22 aircraft and six vessels. Observers speculate that the exercises may involve the first catapult take-off test of China's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, which recently returned to dock after its initial sea trial. Taiwan plans to conduct its own live-fire exercises from July 22-26, incorporating lessons from recent global conflicts. Beijing criticized these exercises, asserting that Taiwan's independence efforts are futile."

Martenson, PhD (Duke), MBA (Cornell) is an economic researcher and futurist specializing in energy and resource depletion, and founder of PeakProsperity.com.\n\nHe is one of a small list of favorites of mine that I am constantly reading and following on Twitter and on his site. He was also one of the first to sound the alarm about Covid in the U.S. while the mainstream media (and the rest of the nation) hadn't figured out the obvious yet.\n\nIn our 75 minute audio interview, we discussed a wide range of topics, including the potential for World War 3, the immigration crisis, the state of the economy in the U.S., our nation's response to Covid and looking back on the events of 9/11 more than 20 years later.\n\nChris told me right off the bat that he has significant concerns about the Russia/Ukraine war escalating due to the U.S. war machine making unilateral decisions: \"So here's the event that bothers me the most right now. A month ago, we hear that Ukraine has used some of their first long-range capabilities to attack Russia's over-the-horizon nuclear early detection radar system. One of them, right?\"\n\n\"A couple of weeks later, a second one. All right. Do you think anybody listening to this really believes that we voted for somebody who made that decision to target those things?\"\n\nHe continued: \"They didn't consult any congressmen or senators. There's like no presidential input involved. Somebody somewhere in the deep state said, you know what, let's blind Russia right now for nuclear attacks and hope for the best. Or what? I don't know what their plan is, but we can all feel it -- that we have an out-of-control machine that makes decisions that have nothing to do with what's best for you or me or anybody else.\"\n\nThe conversation then look a hard turn into discussing the deep state, the U.S. war machine and the events of 9/11. Chris and I both shared our concerns with the details we were given about the events of September 11, 2001, specifically regarding Building 7...(READ THIS FULL INTERVIEW AND LISTEN TO THE AUDIO HERE).",

Russia's United Nations ambassador says he can't.\n\nWhen asked to respond to the claim from the presumptive Republican nominee, Vassily Nebenzia told reporters Monday that \"the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\"\n\nAt a CNN town hall in May 2023, Trump said: \"They're dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I'll have that done -- I'll have that done in 24 hours.\" He said that would happen after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. And he keeps repeating the claim on the campaign trail.\n\nDuring last week's debate with President Joe Biden, Trump claimed, \"If we had a real president, a president that knew -- that was respected by Putin ... he would have never invaded Ukraine.\"\n\nTrump campaign's communications director Steven Cheung said Tuesday that \"a top priority in his second term will be to quickly negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\"\n\n\"Trump believes European nations should be paying more of the cost of the conflict,\" Cheung said.\n\nRelated Story: How to Get Voters the Facts They Need Without a Trump Jan. 6 Trial\n\nNebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 in Istanbul when Russia and Ukraine were \"very close\" to an agreement. Moscow invaded its neighbor two months earlier on Feb. 24, 2022, though Russia insists its \"special military operation\" began in 2014 after clashes in Ukraine's east resulted in Moscow seizing the Crimea Peninsula.\n\nThe Russian ambassador blamed Ukraine's Western backers for blocking the April 2022 peace deal and telling Kyiv to keep fighting Russia.\n\nNow, he said, Zelenskyy \"is running around with his so-called peace plan which, of course, is not a peace plan but a joke.\" While meeting in Switzerland last month, nearly 80 countries called for the \"territorial integrity\" of Ukraine to be the basis for any peace agreement to end the war. But some key developing nations did not join in and Russia did not attend the conference.\n\nRelated Story: Manhattan Prosecutors Agree to Delay Trump's Sentencing\n\nNebenzia pointed to Putin's offer on June 14 to \"immediately\" order a cease-fire in Ukraine and start negotiations if Kyiv begins withdrawing troops from the four regions annexed by Moscow in 2022 and renounces plans to join NATO.\n\nZelenskyy, who has vowed not to give up any territory, rejected what he called an ultimatum by Putin to surrender more land.\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment about Nebenzia's remarks.\n\nRelated Story: How did CNN's Moderators Do in the Biden-Trump Debate? It Almost ...\n\nAfter Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian forces thwarted their drive to the capital. Much of the fighting has been focused in Ukraine's south and east, where Moscow illegally seized four regions, although it doesn't fully control any of them.\n\nBut Ukraine is still struggling to stabilize parts of its front line after desperately needed military assistance from the United States was delayed for months before being approved in April. And Russia took advantage of the Ukrainian weapons shortage to launch an offensive and has made gains.\n\nNebenzia called Zelenskyy's peace formula \"a nonstarter\" and said he needs to be \"realistic\" and take into account what's happened since April. The more difficult the situation becomes for Ukraine on the ground, he warned, the more difficult diplomacy will become to end the war.",

        "title": "Aiming to Lower Gas Prices, Feds Boost Supply in Time for the 4th",
        "body": "Gas prices could be about to get cheaper, just in time for summer road travel, as about 42 million gallons of gasoline makes its way into the fuel market.\n\nIn May, the Biden administration announced that the one million barrels of gasoline in the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve were up for sale. Contracts were awarded to five companies, and barrels were sold at an average of $2.34 per gallon. The gasoline was released to the contracted companies as of June 30.\n\nAmos Hochstein, deputy assistant to the president and senior advisor for energy and investment, says the release of gas should soon help drive down costs at the pump or, at least, prevent the price from increasing.\n\n\"It's not even oil -- it's a million barrels of gasoline directly into the gas market,\" says Hochstein, who is the leading expert and advisor to President Joe Biden on gasoline. By contrast, when oil reserves are released it still takes time to refine into gasoline. This action will move gas into the U.S. supply faster, but it's one that can't be done very often, says Hochstein.\n\n\"This is a one shot deal,\" says Hochstein, adding that it was timed before July Fourth to blunt the pressure on gas supply due to travel demands.\n\nFor context, 42 million gallons is about 11% of the total amount of gas that vehicles guzzle each day in the U.S., about 376 million gallons.\n\nLowering gas prices doesn't just benefit the average driver, it also means trucks that deliver supplies and food can run on cheaper fuel. Gas costs are factored into overall prices of goods, so cheaper gas can, theoretically, bring down prices -- or at least prevent them from going up.\n\nCheaper gas prices certainly can't hurt Biden, whose campaign is still reeling from last week's debate in which the president's performance was so poor it prompted a bevy of outlets to call for him to bow out of his bid for reelection. Presidents don't control gas prices, but they can enact policies related to drilling, refining and, in the case of today's news, releasing gas from reserves. Those actions can ultimately impact what drivers pay at the pump.\n\nWho will see cheaper gas?\n\nGas prices have come down since hitting a peak in June 2022 when the average price for regular unleaded gas was $5.016, according to AAA, which tracks gas prices. As of today, the national average gas price is $3.501, according to AAA. It's up negligibly from last week's average of $3.469 and slightly lower than the average of $3.535 at the same time one year ago.\n\nThis release of gas should flow supply into gas stations during the Fourth of July rush. It'll primarily impact Northeast states including Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. But Hochstein says it could reach the Midwest, as well.\n\nThe Northeast will see cheaper gas because the barrels originate in the Northeast Reserve. \"When we sell this gasoline into the market, it loses value if you're trucking it across the country,\" says Hochstein. \"It is most valuable in the immediate area where it is in the Northeast.\"\n\nAverage gas prices tend to be highest out West with California ($4.790) leading the pack, followed by Hawaii ($4.702), Washington ($4.306), Oregon ($4.051) and Nevada ($4.035). On the low end, typical prices are found in Southern states led by Mississippi ($2.957), Louisiana ($3.028), Arkansas ($3.060), Oklahoma ($3.080) and Texas ($3.099).\n\nWhat influences gas prices?\n\nGas prices are set based on several factors including the price of raw crude oil -- more than half the price -- and the cost of refining that oil. The price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude is a bench market for oil prices in North America. Since its peak of $115 in the summer of 2022, West Texas Intermediate crude has fallen to around $83 today.\n\nToday's oil prices are influenced by global factors including the war between Russia and Ukraine and the war in the Middle East. Both areas producing oil and gas are under a lot of strain, says Hochstein. In 2022, following the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine, the administration announced a 180 million-barrel sale of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase gas supplies.\n\nBeyond oil and refining costs, gas prices also include a federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon and a state tax. On Monday, seven states hiked gas taxes.\n\nTiming of the release of this gas was critical, says Hochstein. That's because gas prices tend to go up during the summer largely due to several factors:\n\nHigher demand due to summer travel. AAA estimates that nearly 71 million people are expected to travel over the entire July 4 week, with 60.6 million traveling by car -- a record high. The switch to summer-blend gasoline, which costs more than winter-blend gasoline. Vehicles are less efficient during the summer months due to heat.Hot temperatures that can make it difficult to refine oil, as well, which can take its toll on gas supplies. Hurricanes and other extreme weather events in areas where oil drilling and refining take place.\n\nMore From NerdWallet\n\nWhy Are Gas Prices So High?Heads Up, Drivers: 7 States Will Pump Up Gas Taxes on July 12024 Summer Travel Report\n\nThe article Aiming to Lower Gas Prices, Feds Boost Supply in Time for the 4th originally appeared on NerdWallet.\n\nMore from this section\n\nSimone Biles headlines a U.S. women's gymnastics team eyeing redemption at the Paris Olympics\n\n'Artificial Wisdom' is a smash hit!\n\nCharles Symington is the New President of Primum Familiae Vini",

Lower gas prices could help reduce overall costs for goods and services, benefiting consumers and businesses alike. This action comes as gas prices have decreased from their peak in June 2022 but remain influenced by global factors such as geopolitical conflicts and seasonal demand."

        "body": "Gas prices could be about to get cheaper, just in time for summer road travel, as about 42 million gallons of gasoline makes its way into the fuel market.\n\nIn May, the Biden administration announced that the one million barrels of gasoline in the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve were up for sale. Contracts were awarded to five companies, and barrels were sold at an average of $2.34 per gallon. The gasoline was released to the contracted companies as of June 30.\n\nAmos Hochstein, deputy assistant to the president and senior advisor for energy and investment, says the release of gas should soon help drive down costs at the pump or, at least, prevent the price from increasing.\n\n\"It's not even oil -- it's a million barrels of gasoline directly into the gas market,\" says Hochstein, who is the leading expert and advisor to President Joe Biden on gasoline. By contrast, when oil reserves are released it still takes time to refine into gasoline. This action will move gas into the U.S. supply faster, but it's one that can't be done very often, says Hochstein.\n\n\"This is a one shot deal,\" says Hochstein, adding that it was timed before July Fourth to blunt the pressure on gas supply due to travel demands.\n\nFor context, 42 million gallons is about 11% of the total amount of gas that vehicles guzzle each day in the U.S., about 376 million gallons.\n\nLowering gas prices doesn't just benefit the average driver, it also means trucks that deliver supplies and food can run on cheaper fuel. Gas costs are factored into overall prices of goods, so cheaper gas can, theoretically, bring down prices -- or at least prevent them from going up.\n\nCheaper gas prices certainly can't hurt Biden, whose campaign is still reeling from last week's debate in which the president's performance was so poor it prompted a bevy of outlets to call for him to bow out of his bid for reelection. Presidents don't control gas prices, but they can enact policies related to drilling, refining and, in the case of today's news, releasing gas from reserves. Those actions can ultimately impact what drivers pay at the pump.\n\nWho will see cheaper gas?\n\nGas prices have come down since hitting a peak in June 2022 when the average price for regular unleaded gas was $5.016, according to AAA, which tracks gas prices. As of today, the national average gas price is $3.501, according to AAA. It's up negligibly from last week's average of $3.469 and slightly lower than the average of $3.535 at the same time one year ago.\n\nThis release of gas should flow supply into gas stations during the Fourth of July rush. It'll primarily impact Northeast states including Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. But Hochstein says it could reach the Midwest, as well.\n\nThe Northeast will see cheaper gas because the barrels originate in the Northeast Reserve. \"When we sell this gasoline into the market, it loses value if you're trucking it across the country,\" says Hochstein. \"It is most valuable in the immediate area where it is in the Northeast.\"\n\nAverage gas prices tend to be highest out West with California ($4.790) leading the pack, followed by Hawaii ($4.702), Washington ($4.306), Oregon ($4.051) and Nevada ($4.035). On the low end, typical prices are found in Southern states led by Mississippi ($2.957), Louisiana ($3.028), Arkansas ($3.060), Oklahoma ($3.080) and Texas ($3.099).\n\nWhat influences gas prices?\n\nGas prices are set based on several factors including the price of raw crude oil -- more than half the price -- and the cost of refining that oil. The price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude is a bench market for oil prices in North America. Since its peak of $115 in the summer of 2022, West Texas Intermediate crude has fallen to around $83 today.\n\nToday's oil prices are influenced by global factors including the war between Russia and Ukraine and the war in the Middle East. Both areas producing oil and gas are under a lot of strain, says Hochstein. In 2022, following the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine, the administration announced a 180 million-barrel sale of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase gas supplies.\n\nBeyond oil and refining costs, gas prices also include a federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon and a state tax. On Monday, seven states hiked gas taxes.\n\nTiming of the release of this gas was critical, says Hochstein. That's because gas prices tend to go up during the summer largely due to several factors:\n\nHigher demand due to summer travel. AAA estimates that nearly 71 million people are expected to travel over the entire July 4 week, with 60.6 million traveling by car -- a record high.\n\nThe switch to summer-blend gasoline, which costs more than winter-blend gasoline. Vehicles are less efficient during the summer months due to heat.Hot temperatures that can make it difficult to refine oil, as well, which can take its toll on gas supplies. Hurricanes and other extreme weather events in areas where oil drilling and refining take place.\n\nMore From NerdWalletWhy Are Gas Prices So High?Heads Up, Drivers: 7 States Will Pump Up Gas Taxes on July 12024 Summer Travel Report\n\nAnna Helhoski writes for NerdWallet.

        "body": "Ukraine War, Russia sanctions speeds demand by U.S. allies, CEO says\n\nAround 200 of the workers Piasecki Aircraft Corp. plans to hire at its new \"Heliplex\" in the former Sikorsky factory near G.O. Carlson Airport will rebuild Vietnam-era Chinook helicopters for military and civilian use by the U.S. and allied nations, chief executive John W. Piasecki said Tuesday. He spoke at a luncheon to announce the venture at the plant in Sadsbury Township, near Coatesville, Chester County.\n\nThe work will be done in partnership with Columbia Helicopters of Aurora, Oregon, which plans a similar number of hires, said Columbia chief executive Dave Balevic, who joined Piasecki, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D., Pa., and other officials at the event.\n\nPiasecki so far has hired 31 engineers and technicians at Coatesville since agreeing to buy the facility last year. The company expects to eventually employ at least 400, including those who will work on the Chinook upgrades.\n\nPiasecki said the Russia-Ukraine war had prompted \"new demand from our allies\" for heavy-lift helicopters.\n\nAging Russian-built helicopters in the arsenals of former Soviet-allied states \"can't operate because of the lack of parts, due to Ukrainian War sanctions,\" Piasecki added. \"This has opened a window for Columbia and Piasecki to re-establish\" a program to update those helicopters.\n\nHe said Casey and other Pennsylvania representatives in Congress had pressed the military to support new helicopter research and help allies buy U.S.-made helicopters. Casey said military industries are important to U.S. national security and manufacturing employment.\n\nThe updated helicopters, Columbia Model 107-III, will include more powerful engines, glass cockpits, improved autopilot, rotor and fuel systems.\n\nPiasecki will remove old transmissions, rotors and other components, ship them to Oregon for refurbishment, and install new wire and cockpit systems, along with the refurbished equipment, then paint and test the upgraded helicopters, including flight testing.\n\nThe move comes as Boeing's heavy-lift helicopter division, which makes Chinooks at plants in Ridley Park, Delaware County and in Arizona, has been lobbying for more military orders to keep from closing its Chinook and Osprey production lines.\n\nBoeing's design unit, Piasecki, the Leonardo helicopter factory in Northeast Philadelphia, and other helicopter and parts makers have been lobbying for government contracts to build unmanned, electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft as drone warfare has threatened to make a lot of U.S. and foreign military equipment obsolete and sparked interest, and U.S. funding, for new designs.\n\nThe companies have a shared history. Piasecki Aircraft was founded by Philadelphia-born Frank Piasecki, a University of Pennsylvania and New York University grad who started building helicopters for the U.S. Navy during World War II, and is still controlled by family members.\n\nHis team designed the Chinook as a dual-rotor heavy-living aircraft, which Boeing purchased in 1960 and built for use in the Vietnam War, first at Piasecki's former Vertol plant in Prospect Park, Delaware County, then at the current Ridley Park complex between the Delaware River and I-95. That plant now employs around 3,500 and continues to update Chinooks for the Army, Air Force, Special Forces, and allied militaries.\n\nColumbia founder Wes Lematta bought surplus Chinooks, built by Boeing in Delaware County as the U.S. scaled down forces in Vietnam in the early 1970s. Columbia eventually licensed what it calls the Model 107 line of helicopters based on Boeing's Chinook airframe. Scores of old Chinooks are stored at an Air Force base in Arizona and are available to upgrade, according to Columbia.\n\nThat company operated six Model 107-II helicopters for the U.S. in Afghanistan, and has also sold and serviced the helicopters for use in the Philippines, South Korea and Switzerland, Balevic said. But production of those helicopters had trailed in recent years, before the recent interest.\n\nPiasecki and Balevic said their partnership will build a new Model 107-III helicopter. \"We will transform the heavy-lift helicopter industry worldwide,\" Balevic said, promising \"more fuel efficient, powerful and robust\" aircraft \"for decades to come.\"\n\nPiasecki said last year that it hoped to eventually employ 400 in all at the 219,000-square-foot Heliplex near Coatesville, while keeping its Essington headquarters and development center open as well.\n\nThe Columbia project will account for about half of the projected staff. Piasecki also presented models of alternate-fuel and training aircraft it has been working on and hopes to build at the Heliplex.",

Martenson, PhD (Duke), MBA (Cornell) is an economic researcher and futurist specializing in energy and resource depletion, and founder of PeakProsperity.com.\n\nHe is one of a small list of favorites of mine that I am constantly reading and following on Twitter and on his site. He was also one of the first to sound the alarm about Covid in the U.S. while the mainstream media (and the rest of the nation) hadn't figured out the obvious yet.\n\nIn our 75 minute audio interview, we discussed a wide range of topics, including the potential for World War 3, the immigration crisis, the state of the economy in the U.S., our nation's response to Covid and looking back on the events of 9/11 more than 20 years later.\n\nChris told me right off the bat that he has significant concerns about the Russia/Ukraine war escalating due to the U.S. war machine making unilateral decisions: \"So here's the event that bothers me the most right now. A month ago, we hear that Ukraine has used some of their first long-range capabilities to attack Russia's over-the-horizon nuclear early detection radar system. One of them, right?\"\n\n\"A couple of weeks later, a second one. All right. Do you think anybody listening to this really believes that we voted for somebody who made that decision to target those things?\"\n\nHe continued: \"They didn't consult any congressmen or senators. There's like no presidential input involved. Somebody somewhere in the deep state said, you know what, let's blind Russia right now for nuclear attacks and hope for the best. Or what? I don't know what their plan is, but we can all feel it -- that we have an out-of-control machine that makes decisions that have nothing to do with what's best for you or me or anybody else.\"\n\nThe conversation then look a hard turn into discussing the deep state, the U.S. war machine and the events of 9/11. Chris and I both shared our concerns with the details we were given about the events of September 11, 2001, specifically regarding Building 7.\n\nChris told me: \"My PhD from Duke University is in a life science. But to get there, I took physics, I took chemistry, organic chemistry, all kinds of things, right? So I'm a big believer in chemistry. Physics and chemistry, okay? So with that said, there's some laws out there. There are natural laws, like the law of gravity. You can not believe in it. You can decide that you can cross your legs, float, but nobody does it, right? It just doesn't happen. It's this thing. It's like death. I'm gonna evade death. No, you're not, right?\"\n\nHe continued: \"Second, there's this law of the conservation of momentum, right? So if you're standing on a pond that's frozen over and I'm standing on a pond and you push on me, we're both going in opposite directions, right? It's just how it is. So when we look at Building Seven, if you were standing on the corner, any one of the four corners, it fell symmetrically like an imploding building, but leave that aside, that observation. If you were standing on the corner at the moment it let go, NIST itself had to finally admit that for two and a quarter seconds, that building fell at free fall.\"\n\nChris explained why this is so concerning: \"Meaning if you dropped a bowling ball into the air off the corner of the building at the same time that let go, it would track at the same pace. Like if you jumped off a bridge that was 88 feet high. Yes. If you jumped off that building, you and the corner of that building would be eye to eye staring at each other as it went down.\"\n\n\"That building had 80,000 tons of structural steel in it. It doesn't just go away. It can't, but it did. For two and a quarter seconds, there was no resistance to downward momentum. That's not... you can't crumple that. There's no possible way to begin progressively collapsing this thing. You can't do that. So we have to then come up with an explanation for how 80,000 tons of structural steel stepped aside and provided no resistance for two and a quarter seconds.\"\n\nAfter hashing out our thoughts on 9/11, our conversation turned to the forthcoming election. Martenson expressed to me that the election either could \"already be in the bag\" or \"not be happening\", two ideas I couldn't help but be skeptical of.\n\nChris told me: \"So what is the media not talking about? What's not happening that really ought to be happening? And on that front, you know what's really unnerving to me? Biden and Harris aren't really campaigning. You know, they just sort of weakly started lately. I was starting to see a few ads here and there, but it's lame. It's like they don't even care. And so how is it that you wouldn't even campaign? Well, one of two reasons. You're not worried about the election because it's already in the bag, right? Or there's not going to be one.\"\n\nTuring our attention to the problems the nation faces, we talked about the U.S. debt crisis and the nation's immigration crisis.\n\n\"We clearly have a runaway monetary fiscal train at this point in time, and it's just headed towards what I call the nuclear reactor critical mass runaway moment,\" Chris told me. \"Higher interest payments beget more borrowing, which begets higher interest rates, which begets higher interest payments. And you're on that spiral. That's the death spiral, which happens to companies, but it can happen to countries too.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We could have probably kicked the can another cycle or two, but now you have the rest of the world backing away, if not trotting away from the U.S. dollar, and people don't get it yet. China's negatively hoarding their treasuries, they're dis-hoarding right now. So China's selling. Japan's in a world of hurt. I don't know if you see, but the yen's here banging around at the 160 level again. So they're selling, and their big bank has to probably sell some treasuries. Russia, obviously not buying any of our crap -- they kicked that habit in 2018. But Saudi Arabia now not buying treasuries, dis-hoarding.\"\n\nAnd he raised questions about where, exactly, treasury demand is coming from, telling me: \"So who's buying? Well, you go to the Treasury International Capital Report. You find out, oh good, the Cayman Islands stepped in. Dude, we need an audit of the Fed right away. I don't think it's always suspicious to see it, no, because every time we need the Cayman Islands and the UK to step up and buy just hand over fist treasuries, somehow they do.\"\n\nFinally, Chris -- like most of us watching flawed policy unfold -- says we're definitely going back to QE: \"But listen, here's a prediction. It's very easy to make for me. The Fed's going to have to go back to QE. It's not just lowering interest rates -- that's going to do dick all for us at this point. They're going to go back to QE because we can't risk a treasury failure. We have $9 trillion of debt, new and existing, rolling through the auction market this next calendar year. And so the Fed's going to have to step in and start buying that stuff. Full stop. That's inflation.\"\n\nLast, we discussed some alarming facts about the ongoing immigration crisis in the U.S., namely the idea that there are tons of military aged men coming from countries like China and entering the country.\n\nChris thinks its part of a larger plan: \"Well, they're letting in the teams that are going to attack us and dismantle us from within when the war starts. I mean, that sounds conspiratorial, but God damn, if I can't help but think that. You know, military. It's the data. You can't exclude it out of hand. You just can't. Maybe not all of them. Let's say we had 20 million people come in over the last five, six years or whatever the number is now, right?\"\n\n\"What if just 10% of them are nefarious? They're MS-13 gang members who got disordered from a Nicaraguan jail, or they're actual SEAL team equivalents coming from China, Afghanistan, wherever, right? That's just 10%. Okay, well, there's 2 million people inside our country now who are poised to cause damage if called upon, right? And no one knows where they are and they don't have social security numbers. Nobody can track them. You know, it's just, you're a racist if you do.\"",

Moscow invaded its neighbor two months earlier on Feb. 24, 2022, though Russia insists its \"special military operation\" began in 2014 after clashes in Ukraine's east resulted in Moscow seizing the Crimea Peninsula.\n\nThe Russian ambassador blamed Ukraine's Western backers for blocking the April 2022 peace deal and telling Kyiv to keep fighting Russia.\n\nNow, he said, Zelenskyy \"is running around with his so-called peace plan which, of course, is not a peace plan but a joke.\" While meeting in Switzerland last month, nearly 80 countries called for the \"territorial integrity\" of Ukraine to be the basis for any peace agreement to end the war. But some key developing nations did not join in and Russia did not attend the conference.\n\nNebenzia pointed to Putin's offer on June 14 to \"immediately\" order a cease-fire in Ukraine and start negotiations if Kyiv begins withdrawing troops from the four regions annexed by Moscow in 2022 and renounces plans to join NATO.\n\nZelenskyy, who has vowed not to give up any territory, rejected what he called an ultimatum by Putin to surrender more land.\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment about Nebenzia's remarks.\n\nAfter Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian forces thwarted their drive to the capital. Much of the fighting has been focused in Ukraine's south and east, where Moscow illegally seized four regions, although it doesn't fully control any of them.\n\nBut Ukraine is still struggling to stabilize parts of its front line after desperately needed military assistance from the United States was delayed for months before being approved in April. And Russia took advantage of the Ukrainian weapons shortage to launch an offensive and has made gains.\n\nNebenzia called Zelenskyy's peace formula \"a nonstarter\" and said he needs to be \"realistic\" and take into account what's happened since April. The more difficult the situation becomes for Ukraine on the ground, he warned, the more difficult diplomacy will become to end the war.",

        "body": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin welcomes Ukrainian Defense Secretary Rustem Umerov to the Pentagon in Washington on July 2, 2024. (Drew Angerer/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced Tuesday that the United States will provide $2.3 billion more in military assistance to Ukraine, which includes missile systems, anti-tank weapons, and more munitions.\n\n\"Make no mistake, Ukraine is not alone, and the United States will never waver in our support,\" Mr. Austin said during a news conference at the Pentagon as he met with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov.\n\n\"Alongside some 50 allies and partners, we'll continue to provide critical capabilities that Ukraine needs to push back Russian aggression today and to deter Russian aggression tomorrow,\" he added.\n\n\"This package ... will provide more air defense interceptors, anti-tank weapons, and other critical munitions\" taken from U.S. military stocks, Mr. Austin confirmed.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media Sunday that Russia had dropped more than 800 powerful glide bombs in Ukraine in the last week. He urged national leaders to relax restrictions on the use of Western weapons to strike military targets inside Russia. In particular, he said, Ukraine needs the \"necessary means to destroy the carriers of these bombs, including Russian combat aircraft, wherever they are.\"\n\nMr. Austin did not refer to the aforementioned restrictions in his Tuesday comments, but he told Mr. Umerov that they would discuss \"more ways to meet Ukraine's immediate security needs and to build a future force to ward off more Russian aggression.\"\n\nAccording to a Council on Foreign Relations think tank analysis as well as the Committee for a Responsible Budget, some $175 billion has been sent to Ukraine since February 2022, when the Russia-Ukraine war began. A large portion of that -- $61.3 billion -- was sent to the Eastern European country in an April bill that passed both houses of Congress.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met with Mr. Zelenskyy during a public event in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, and asked him for a \"quick cease-fire.\"\n\n\"I asked the president to consider whether ... a quick cease-fire could speed up the peace talks,\" the Hungarian leader said at a press conference, according to local media reports.\n\nIn response, Mr. Zelenskyy said that he hopes for a \"just peace,\" adding that \"we appreciate that your visit takes place right after the start of the Hungarian Presidency of the European Union. This clearly indicates our common European priorities, of how important it is to bring a just peace to Ukraine.\"\n\nBut he stressed that he hopes that the European Union, of which Hungary is a member, will back his country.\n\n\"It is also very important for all of us in Europe that Europe's support for Ukraine remains sufficient, including our defense against\" Russia, the Ukrainian leader added.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram, \"Our cities and communities suffer daily from such Russian strikes,\" while saying that there are ways to overcome this that include \"destroying Russian missile launchers, striking with real long-range capability and increasing the number of modern air defense systems.\"\n\nHe also posted images that showed a large smoldering crater near a destroyed building, as well as pictures of bodies.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, Russia has not issued a public comment in response to Mr. Austin's announcement. Previous U.S. aid packages to Ukraine have been met by scorn from top Russian officials, who have suggested that the aid would lead to more deaths in the conflict.\n\nAfter the April package was passed in Congress, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters at the time that \"money allocated and the weapons that will be supplied will not change this dynamic,\" adding, \"More Ukrainians will die, Ukraine will suffer greater losses.\"\n\nThe Pentagon announcement was made about a day after Ukraine's security service announced that it had stopped what it described as an attempted coup that would have \"played into Russia's hands.\"\n\n\"Under the pretext of holding a so-called 'veche' [a people's assembly], the perpetrators planned to announce a 'removal from power' of the current military and political leadership of Ukraine,\" the statement said. \"Then they hoped to seize the building of the Parliament of Ukraine and block its work.\"",

And he keeps repeating the claim on the campaign trail.\n\nDuring last week's debate with President Joe Biden, Trump claimed, \"If we had a real president, a president that knew -- that was respected by Putin ... he would have never invaded Ukraine.\"\n\nTrump campaign's communications director Steven Cheung said Tuesday that \"a top priority in his second term will be to quickly negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\"\n\n\"Trump believes European nations should be paying more of the cost of the conflict,\" Cheung said.\n\nNebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 in Istanbul when Russia and Ukraine were \"very close\" to an agreement. Moscow invaded its neighbor two months earlier on Feb. 24, 2022, though Russia insists its \"special military operation\" began in 2014 after clashes in Ukraine's east resulted in Moscow seizing the Crimea Peninsula.\n\nThe Russian ambassador blamed Ukraine's Western backers for blocking the April 2022 peace deal and telling Kyiv to keep fighting Russia.\n\nNow, he said, Zelenskyy \"is running around with his so-called peace plan which, of course, is not a peace plan but a joke.\" While meeting in Switzerland last month, nearly 80 countries called for the \"territorial integrity\" of Ukraine to be the basis for any peace agreement to end the war. But some key developing nations did not join in and Russia did not attend the conference.\n\nNebenzia pointed to Putin's offer on June 14 to \"immediately\" order a cease-fire in Ukraine and start negotiations if Kyiv begins withdrawing troops from the four regions annexed by Moscow in 2022 and renounces plans to join NATO.\n\nZelenskyy, who has vowed not to give up any territory, rejected what he called an ultimatum by Putin to surrender more land.\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment about Nebenzia's remarks.\n\nAfter Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian forces thwarted their drive to the capital. Much of the fighting has been focused in Ukraine's south and east, where Moscow illegally seized four regions, although it doesn't fully control any of them.\n\nBut Ukraine is still struggling to stabilize parts of its front line after desperately needed military assistance from the United States was delayed for months before being approved in April. And Russia took advantage of the Ukrainian weapons shortage to launch an offensive and has made gains.\n\nNebenzia called Zelenskyy's peace formula \"a nonstarter\" and said he needs to be \"realistic\" and take into account what's happened since April. The more difficult the situation becomes for Ukraine on the ground, he warned, the more difficult diplomacy will become to end the war.",

Trump has reiterated this claim during his campaign, suggesting he would negotiate with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Nebenzia argued that a potential peace deal in April 2022 was blocked by Ukraine's Western allies and criticized Zelenskyy's current peace plan. He also mentioned Putin's offer for a cease-fire if Ukraine withdraws from annexed regions and renounces NATO ambitions, which Zelenskyy rejected. The Trump campaign emphasized that negotiating an end to the war would be a priority in a second term, with a focus on European nations bearing more conflict costs. The situation remains complex, with ongoing fighting and diplomatic challenges."

        "title": "Foreign professor fired from Chinese university after interview with VOA",
        "body": "Björn Alexander Düben, a German assistant professor at Jilin University's School of Public Diplomacy, was mysteriously dismissed and instructed to leave China after a nine-year tenure, following his participation in an interview with Voice of America (VOA). This dismissal highlights the severe restrictions on free speech imposed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nDüben's troubles began shortly after he commented on Chinese leader Xi Jinping's visit to Europe in an article published by VOA Mandarin on May 11. The next day, he received a WeChat message from the university's international secretary, which stated, \"It is well known that colleges and universities must be responsible for any form of interviews with domestic and foreign media.\" This message hinted at the sensitive nature of his comments regarding the Chinese leadership.\n\nOn May 15, Düben was informed that his classes for the day were suspended due to all classrooms being occupied. Shortly after, a colleague informed him that not only were his classes canceled indefinitely, but his employment was also being terminated, citing decisions made by \"unspecified higher-level authorities.\" Düben was also told that his China Talent visa, which was valid until 2033, would be canceled unless he chose to resign or face a disciplinary inquiry, both of which would likely lead to his dismissal.\n\nFeeling cornered and fearing repercussions from contesting the decision, Düben chose to resign. Following his resignation, he was told he could retain his visa but had to leave China by May 30 and would be barred from re-entering the country. The university administrator indicated that these were instructions from \"above,\" allowing no room for negotiation.\n\nThis incident wasn't Düben's first foray into media commentary. Over the years, he had frequently provided insights on sensitive topics related to China's foreign policy for various international outlets, including Reuters and The Diplomat, a current affairs magazine. However, his comments on Xi Jinping's visit, despite being similar in nature to his previous commentary, triggered unprecedented consequences, possibly due to the current heightened political sensitivities in China.\n\nEric, who did not provide a last name, is a former agent of the Political Security Bureau of China's Ministry of Public Security who has since fled to Australia. He shed light on the possible internal reactions to Düben's comments. He suggested that such statements could be seen as offensive by Chinese authorities, particularly if they perceive them as undermining the image of the CCP or its leaders. Eric explained, \"After your report came out, anyone who sees it, such as Chinese media correspondents stationed abroad or other officials, may report the public opinion involving the number one leader to their superiors... The senior leaders of the superior department will think the situation is serious and initiate countermeasures, such as deciding to expel the person mentioned in the article from the country.\"\n\nFurthermore, Düben commented on the Russia-Ukraine war in the VOA story, noting that \"Russia has long been short of basic ammunition, but now many supply loopholes have been plugged,\" and \"Russia currently needs the most parts that China can provide but is difficult to track specific dual-use parts.\" Eric said the comment on the loopholes needs fact-checking. \"If it's not true, the Chinese government will think it is a frame-up and smear, and the anger of being wronged can easily lead to retaliation. If true, how can an ordinary assistant professor come to this conclusion?\"\n\nThe conditions of Düben's employment contract at Jilin University, which mandated adherence to China's sovereignty and social order and prohibited any activities that could disrupt academic or ideological norms, were also noted. These vague clauses could have been weaponized against him, impacting his legal standing and complicating any defense he might mount in a legal challenge against his dismissal.\n\nErika Staffas Edström, an analyst at the Swedish National China Center at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, commented on the broader implications of such incidents. She told VOA, \"It is clear that the Chinese Communist Party has stepped up its efforts to strengthen its control on global discourse and information in recent years. However, it is too early to say whether this specific incident represents another step by the Chinese Communist Party to strengthen its control over free speech.\"\n\nOverall, Düben's case exemplifies the increasing challenges that foreign academics face in China, where political sensitivities can trigger harsh reactions from authorities, leading to censorship and suppression of academic freedom. This incident not only affects Düben but also serves as a warning to the international academic and diplomatic communities about the risks of engaging in sensitive discussions related to China's political landscape.",

        "title": "Strengthening Taiwan's resiliency",
        "body": "This report recommends actions for the new leadership of Taiwan to take to enhance its societal resilience against Chinese aggression in the context of both \"gray zone\" conflict and wartime attacks. The report focuses on establishing a comprehensive security strategy and analyzes three key areas particularly important for effective resilience: enhancing cybersecurity for critical infrastructures; improving energy security; and accelerating defense transformation.\n\nThe new administration of Lai Ching-te faces both existing resilience challenges and the potential for significantly greater problems if the People's Republic of China (PRC) pursues expanded gray zone activities or if actual conflict occurs.\"The gray zone describes a set of activities that occur between peace (or cooperation) and war (or armed conflict),\" writes Clementine Starling. \"A multitude of activities fall into this murky in-between -- from nefarious economic activities, influence operations, and cyberattacks to mercenary operations, assassinations, and disinformation campaigns. Generally, gray-zone activities are considered gradualist campaigns by state and non-state actors that combine non-military and quasi-military tools and fall below the threshold of armed conflict. They aim to thwart, destabilize, weaken, or attack an adversary, and they are often tailored toward the vulnerabilities of the target state. While gray-zone activities are nothing new, the onset of new technologies has provided states with more tools to operate and avoid clear categorization, attribution, and detection -- all of which complicates the United States' and its allies' ability to respond.\" Starling, \"Today's Wars Are Fought in the 'Gray Zone.' Here's Everything You Need to Know About it,\" Atlantic Council, February 23, 2022, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/todays-wars-are-fought-in-the-gray-zone-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-it/. The ongoing challenges include substantial disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks, military incursions, and periodic economic coercion. Potential future challenges could involve expansion of one or more of these ongoing Chinese activities. In the context of a more contested environment such as a quarantine,In a quarantine of Taiwan, Beijing would interdict shipments but allow some supplies -- potentially food and medicine -- to pass through unimpeded. This measure would enable the PRC to assert greater sovereignty over Taiwan without formally committing to either a war or a blockade. blockade, or a kinetic conflict, Chinese actions could seek to cause leadership failures and loss of social cohesion; undertake cyberattacks to target critical infrastructures; generate energy shortages; and seek to defeat Taiwan militarily before the United States could provide effective support. The potential for such harms substantially increases the importance of resilient responses by Taiwan.\n\nThe report recommends four major sets of actions to enhance Taiwan's resilience:\n\nResilience is not a new theme in Taiwan. Former President Tsai Ing-wen, who completed two terms in office on May 20, entitled her 2022 National Day Address \"Island of Resilience,\"\"President Tsai Delivers 2022 National Day Address,\" Office of the President of Taiwan, October 10, 2022, https://english.president.gov.tw/News/6348. and similarly identified resilience as a key factor for Taiwan in her two subsequent National Day addresses.\"Full Text of President Tsai Ing-Wen's National Day Address,\" Focus Taiwan website, Central News Agency of Taiwan, October 10, 2023, https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202310100004; and \"President Tsai Delivers 2024 New Year's Address,\" Office of the President, Taiwan, January 1, 2024, https://english.president.gov.tw/NEWS/6662. \"The work of making the Republic of China (Taiwan) a more resilient country is now our most important national development priority,\" she stated in that 2022 speech, in which she articulated four key areas of resilience: economy and industry, social safety net, free and democratic government system, and national defense. What is left undone, however, is aligning these and other resilience elements into a comprehensive security strategy similar to those undertaken by FinlandFinnish Security Committee, Security Strategy for Society: Government Resolution, Ministry of Defense, November 2, 2017, https://turvallisuuskomitea.fi/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/YTS_2017_english.pdf. and Sweden,\"Swedish Defence Commission Submits Total Defence Report,\" Ministry of Defense, December 19, 2023, https://www.government.se/articles/2023/12/swedish-defence-commission-submits-total-defence-report/. which utilize a whole-of society approach to enhance resilience.\n\nResilience is a nation's ability to understand, address, respond to, and recover from any type of national security risk. Given the scale of risk Taiwan faces from China, domestic resilience should be front and center in Taiwan's national security strategy.Pursuing a professional and structured approach to resilience against Chinese aggression will also have a \"halo\" effect, building approaches and expertise that will support effective work on other areas of national security risk. Comparable comprehensive national security approaches, such as the Finnish model, aim to foster and enable an engaged national ecosystem of partners, each with a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities. Finland's model is instructive, underscoring the importance of engagement by the entire society:\n\nComprehensive security thus is far more than just government activities:\n\nThe Finnish strategy identifies seven \"vital functions\" as key areas: leadership; international and European Union activities; defense capability; internal security; economy, infrastructure, and security of supply; functional capacity of the population and services; and psychological resilience.Finnish Security Committee, Security Strategy for Society.\n\nTaiwan has taken a variety of actions to enhance resilience including the establishment in 2022 of the All-out Defense Mobilization Agency.\"All-out Defense Mobilization Agency,\" agency website, n.d., https://aodm.mnd.gov.tw/aodm-en/indexE.aspx. That agency has a useful but limited scope with its mandate of \"comprehensive management of 'planning for mobilization, management, service, civil defense, [and] building reserve capacity.' \"John Dotson, \"Taiwan's 'Military Force Restructuring Plan' and the Extension of Conscripted Military Service,\" Global Taiwan Institute's Global Taiwan Brief 8, no. 3 (2023), https://globaltaiwan.org/2023/02/taiwan-military-force-restructuring-plan-and-the-extension-of-conscripted-military-service/. But while defense is important (and further discussed below), as the Finnish and Swedish strategies underscore, Taiwan should expand its approach to resilience to include the full spectrum of governmental, private sector, and individual tasks -- and the necessary cooperative efforts to make them most effective.\n\nPresident Lai's recent election ushered in an unprecedented third consecutive term for the Democratic Progressive Party.The party does face, however, the governance challenges that come with a hung parliament. This outcome not only provides continuity in the agenda set by the island's duly elected leader, but also presents an opportunity to sharpen the focus areas for resilience. As Taiwan transitions to a Lai presidency, the challenge of shoring up the island's resilience should be at the forefront.\n\nAs a valuable starting point for establishing such an expanded resilience strategy, the Lai government should undertake extensive consultations with both Finland and Sweden -- which could be facilitated as necessary by the United States. Taiwan should also seek to engage with the Hybrid Center of Excellence, based in Finland, which is an \"autonomous, network-based international organization countering hybrid threats.\"Hybrid CoE,\" European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, n.d., https://www.hybridcoe.fi/.\n\nThe discussion below describes several important elements of a comprehensive resilience strategy, and it will be a crucial task for the Lai administration to expand Taiwan's current efforts to the full scope of such an approach. Resilience is a team game with the whole of society playing a role. But only Taiwan's central government can act as the team captain, setting expectations, establishing priorities, formulating and communicating national strategy, and coordinating activities. Only leaders in national-level government can oversee the critical work of developing institutional effectiveness in key areas of risk management and resilience.\n\nAs a starting point, Taiwan should undertake a comprehensive audit now to uncover any gaps in the country's ability to understand, respond to, and recover from both the chronic risks it currently faces and any more acute manifestations of PRC aggression in the future. Taiwan's government should examine the following areas to pursue greater resilience:\n\nWorking with countries that are already developing vanguard resilience capabilities could help Taiwan quickly establish a workable model. For example, the United Kingdom's National Situation CentreLucy Fisher, \"First Glimpse Inside UK's New White House-Style Crisis Situation Centre,\" Telegraph, December 14, 2021, https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/12/14/first-glimpse-inside-uks-new-white-house-style-crisis-situation/. -- built in less than a year during the COVID-19 pandemic -- is a model of developing access to critical data in peacetime and lessons learned from previous crisis scenarios about the practical challenges a nation could face in a variety of scenarios. Many commercial providers offer competent ways of displaying data insights on dashboards, and while this is helpful, it is only part of what can be achieved.\n\nAs a model for its broader resilience requirements, Taiwan will have the benefit of its existing efforts including in the counterdisinformation arena, where it has programs as effective as any in the world, despite the fact that Taiwan consistently faces the world's highest volume of targeted disinformation campaigns.A. Rauchfleisch et al., \"Taiwan's Public Discourse About Disinformation: The Role of Journalism, Academia, and Politics,\" Journalism Practice 17, no. 10 (2023): 2197-2217, https://doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2022.2110928. The saturation of PRC information manipulation across Taiwan's traditional and social media platforms is strategically designed to undermine social cohesion, erode trust in government institutions, and soften resistance to Beijing's forced unification agenda, while sowing doubts about America's commitment to peace and stability in the region.\n\nTaiwan has developed a multifaceted strategy to combat this onslaught, eschewing heavy-handed censorship in favor of promoting free speech and empowering civil society. This approach serves as a beacon for other democracies, demonstrating how to effectively counter disinformation through rapid-response mechanisms, independent fact-checking, along with widespread media literacy initiatives. Collaborative efforts such as the Taiwan FactCheck Center, Cofacts, and MyGoPen have proven instrumental in swiftly identifying and debunking false rumors, notably during the closely watched presidential election on January 13.Chee-Hann Wu, \"Three Musketeers against MIS/Disinformation: Assessing Citizen-Led Fact-Checking Practices in Taiwan,\" Taiwan Insight magazine, July 21, 2023, https://taiwaninsight.org/2023/03/31/three-musketeers-against-mis-disinformation-assessing-citizen-led-fact-checking-practices-in-taiwan/; and David Klepper and Huizhong Wu, \"How Taiwan Beat Back Disinformation and Preserved the Integrity of Its Election,\" Associated Press, January 29, 2024, https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-election-china-disinformation-vote-fraud-4968ef08fd13821e359b8e195b12919c.\n\nTaiwan's Minister of Digital Affairs (MoDA) attributes the island's success in combating this \"infodemic\" to its sophisticated civil-sector efforts, which avoids reliance on reactive takedowns of malicious content akin to a game of whack-a-mole. Much like its handling of the pandemic -- where Taiwan achieved one of the world's lowest COVID-19 fatality rates without resorting to draconian lockdowns -- it has demonstrated resilience and innovation in the digital sphere.E. Glen Weyl and Audrey Tang, \"The Life of a Digital Democracy,\" Plurality (open-source project on collaborative technology and democracy), accessed May 6, 2024, https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/2-2/eng/?mode=dark.\n\nTaiwan's response to disinformation demonstrates that it is well-positioned to establish a comprehensive approach to societal resilience. The discussion below describes several important elements of a comprehensive resilience strategy, but it will be a crucial task for the Lai administration to expand Taiwan's current efforts to the full scope of such an approach.\n\nLike all advanced economies, Taiwan depends on its critical infrastructures. Critical infrastructures have been described as \"sectors whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital . . . that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety.\"\"Critical Infrastructure Sectors,\" US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), 2022, https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors. Since several critical infrastructures are interlinked, it is important in evaluating resilience to \"capture cross-cutting risks and associated dependencies that may have cascading impacts within and across sectors.\"\"National Critical Functions,\" CISA, n.d., https://www.cisa.gov/topics/risk-management/national-critical-functions. Among those interlinked critical infrastructures are energy, communications, transportation, and water. Each of these are critical to society as a whole and each are dependent on digital technology for their operations.\n\nIn Taiwan, the Administration for Cyber Security has identified critical infrastructures \"by their feature types into the following eight fields: energy, water resource, telecommunications, transportation, banking and finance, emergency aid and hospitals, central and local governments, and high-tech parks.\"Taiwan Administration for Cyber Security, \"Cyber Security Defense of Critical Infrastructure: Operations,\" Ministry of Digital Affairs, February 21, 2023, https://moda.gov.tw/en/ACS/operations/ciip/650. It is worth underscoring that several of Taiwan's critical infrastructures, such as the electric grid\"Taipower Announces Grid Resilience Strengthening Construction Plan with NT$564.5 Billion Investment Over 10 Years, Preventing Recurrence of Massive Power Outages,\" Ministry of Economic Affairs, September 15, 2022, https://www.moea.gov.tw/MNS/english/news/News.aspx?kind=6&menu_id=176&news_id=103225#:~:text=Wen%2DSheng%20Tseng%20explained%20that,of%20electricity%20demand%20in%20Taiwan. and the water system,Taiwan Water Corporation provides most of the water in Taiwan.

As described by Taiwan's Administration for Cyber Security, \"Due to Taiwan's unique political and economic situation, the country faces not only a complex global cyber security environment but also severe cyber security threats, making the continuous implementation and improvement of cyber security measures a necessity.\"\"About Us: History,\" Administration for Cyber Security, MoDA, n.d., https://moda.gov.tw/en/ACS/aboutus/history/608. Note: US government analyses likewise underscore the significant number of attacks. As described by the US International Trade Administration (ITA), \"Taiwan faces a disproportionately high number of cyberattacks, receiving as many as 30 million attacks per month in 2022.\" See \"Taiwan -- Country Commercial Guide,\" US ITA, last published January 10, 2024, https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/taiwan-cybersecurity.\n\nThe number of cyberattacks against Taiwan is notable.Statistics are not entirely consistent, and attempted intrusions are sometimes counted as attacks. Published estimates range from five million cyberattacks per day against Taiwanese government agencies\"Taiwanese Gov't Facing 5M Cyber Attacks per Day,\" CyberTalk, Check Point Software Technologies, accessed May 2, 2024, https://www.cybertalk.org/taiwanese-govt-facing-5m-cyber-attacks-per-day/. Other private-sector companies' analyses have reached comparable conclusions. to the detection of 15,000 cyberattacks per second, including attempted intrusions, in Taiwan during the first half of 2023.Huang Tzu-ti, \"Taiwan Hit by 15,000 Cyberattacks per Second in First Half of 2023,\" Taiwan News, August 17, 2023, https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/news/4973448.\n\nThe attacks often focus on key societal infrastructures. A recent Voice of America report noted that just prior to the January 2024 elections:\n\nGoogle researchers have likewise described the cyber threat to key critical infrastructures, revealing that it is \"tracking close to 100 hacking groups out of China [and that these] malicious groups are attacking a wide spectrum of organizations, including the government, private industry players and defense organizations.\"Gagandeep Kaur, \"Is China Waging a Cyber War with Taiwan?,\" CSO Online, December 1, 2023, https://www.csoonline.com/article/1250513/is-china-waging-a-cyber-war-with-taiwan.html#:~:text=Nation%2Dstate%20hacking%20groups%20based.\n\nThe attacks themselves are often relatively sophisticated. Trellix, a cybersecurity firm, described multiple techniques utilized by attackers that \"focused on defense evasion, discovery, and command and control . . . to subvert system defenses to gather information about accounts, systems, and networks.\" Among them are \"living-off-the-land\" techniques, which allow attackers to maintain their intrusions over time with smaller chances of detection.Anne A wrote that \"attackers are likely to employ living off-the-land techniques to gather policing, banking, and political information to achieve their goals. They also likely simultaneously and stealthily evaded security detections from remote endpoints.\"See An, \"Cyberattack on Democracy: Escalating Cyber Threats Immediately Ahead of Taiwan's 2024 Presidential Election,\" Trellix, February 13, 2024, https://www.trellix.com/blogs/research/cyberattack-on-democracy-escalating-cyber-threats-immediately-ahead-of-taiwan-2024-presidential-election/. Separately, a Microsoft Threat Intelligence blog said: \"Microsoft has identified a nation-state activity group tracked as Flax Typhoon, based in China, that is targeting dozens of organizations in Taiwan with the likely intention of performing espionage. Flax Typhoon gains and maintains long-term access to Taiwanese organizations' networks with minimal use of malware, relying on tools built into the operating system, along with some normally benign software to quietly remain in these networks.\" See \"Flax Typhoon Using Legitimate Software to Quietly Access Taiwanese Organizations,\" Microsoft Threat Intelligence blog, August 24, 2023, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/08/24/flax-typhoon-using-legitimate-software-to-quietly-access-taiwanese-organizations/.\n\nWhile no one can say with certainty what actions the PRC would take in the context of a blockade of or outright conflict with Taiwan, the United States is clear-eyed about the potential for attacks on its own critical infrastructures if engaged in conflict with China. The February 2023 Annual Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community notes the likelihood of such PRC cyberattacks in that context:\n\nThe ongoing Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine war further underscore the reality of critical infrastructures as a target in a conflict. It seems reasonable to assume that comparable actions (and perhaps even more) would be undertaken against Taiwan in the event of a blockade or kinetic conflict. \"Probable targets,\" according to James A. Lewis, would include critical infrastructures such as electrical power facilities, information and communications systems, and pipelines.James Lewis, \"Cyberattack on Civilian Critical Infrastructures in a Taiwan Scenario,\" Center for Strategic and International Studies, August 2023, https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2023-08/230811_Lewis_Cyberattack_Taiwan.pdf?VersionId=l.gf7ysPjoW3.OcHvcRuNcpq3gN.Vj8b.\n\nTaiwan can enhance its cyber resilience through its own actions and in collaborative activities with private-sector companies and with the United States. While cyberattacks can be highly disruptive, one of the important lessons of the Ukraine-Russia conflict is that the effects on operations can be mitigated, as described in a CyberScoop analysis that underscores a shift in expectations:\n\nAccording to the analysis, the critical element for such success has been significant multinational and public-private collaboration:\n\nTaiwan should utilize the Ukraine model of cyber resilience -- backed in part by private-sector companies -- and take comparable actions to enhance its cybersecurity. Taiwan has a substantial existing cybersecurity framework on which to build such mitigating actions. Since 2022, the Ministry of Digital Affairs, through its Administration for Cyber Security, is responsible for \"implementing cyber security management and defense mechanisms for national critical infrastructures\" including \"evaluating and auditing cyber security works at government agencies and public entities.\"\"About Us: History,\" Administration for Cyber Security. Utilizing that framework, Taiwan should undertake the following four actions that would significantly enhance the island's cybersecurity resilience.\n\nFirst, Taiwan should utilize cloud-based capabilities to establish a duplicative set of cyber-enabled governmental functions outside of Taiwan. Ukraine undertook such actions, thereby rendering Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine unable to disrupt ongoing governmental activities. Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs has been evaluating the use of public clouds including the possibility of \"digital embassies\" abroad to hold data.Si Ying Thian, \"'Turning Conflicts into Co-creation': Taiwan Government Harnesses Digital Policy for Democracy,\" GovInsider, December 6, 2023, https://govinsider.asia/intl-en/article/turning-conflicts-into-co-creation-taiwans-digital-ministry-moda-harnesses-digital-policy-for-democracy. Taiwan should organize such actions with key cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, which provided support to Ukraine.Frank Konkel, \"How a Push to the Cloud Helped a Ukrainian Bank Keep Faith with Customers amid War,\" NextGov/FCW, November 30, 2023, https://www.nextgov.com/modernization/2023/11/how-push-cloud-helped-ukrainian-bank-keep-faith-customers-amid-war/392375/. The United States should work with Taiwan and appropriate cloud providers to help effectuate such a result.\n\nSecond, Taiwan should establish arrangements with private-sector cybersecurity providers to undertake defensive operations against PRC cyberattacks in the context of a blockade or kinetic conflict. As noted above, such private-sector actions have been instrumental to Ukraine, and would similarly be invaluable for Taiwan. The United States should also help facilitate such private-sector defensive cyber operations for Taiwan.\n\nThird, Taiwan should organize a surge capability of individual cybersecurity experts who can be called upon to complement governmental resources. Both Estonia and the United Kingdom have very effective cyber-reserve approaches, and Taiwan should engage with each country, seeking lessons learned as part of establishing its own reserve corps.\n\nFourth, Taiwan needs to accelerate its low-earth orbit satellite communications program. The Ministry of Digital Affairs' two-year, US$18 million plan to strengthen the resilience of government communications entails building more than 700 satellite receiver stations. The impetus: ships from mainland China have repeatedly severed submarine internet cables in what Taiwan perceived as \"a trial of methods\" that the PRC could use to prepare for a military invasion.Eric Priezkalns, \"Taiwan to Build 700 Satellite Receivers as Defense against China Cutting Submarine Cables,\" CommsRisk, June 13, 2023, https://commsrisk.com/taiwan-to-build-700-satellite-receivers-as-defense-against-china-cutting-submarine-cables/.\n\nThe existing program involves satellites as well as ground-based receivers. The Taiwan Space Agency disclosed its plan for a \"dedicated\" LEO satellite communications project in late 2022,Juliana Suess, \"Starlink 2.0? Taiwan's Plan for a Sovereign Satellite Communications System,\" Commentary, Royal United Services Institute, January 20, 2023, https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/starlink-20-taiwans-plan-sovereign-satellite-communications-system. as a public-private partnership:\n\nIn accord with the Taiwan Relations Act,Taiwan Relations Act, US Pub. L. No. 96-8, 93 Stat. 14 (1979), https://www.congress.gov/96/statute/STATUTE-93/STATUTE-93-Pg14.pdf. and as a matter of long-standing policy, the United States strongly supports Taiwan's defensive capabilities including for cybersecurity. The Integrated Country Strategy of the American Institute in Taiwan (essentially the unofficial US embassy) specifically provides that \"bolster[ing] Taiwan's cybersecurity resilience\" is one of the United States' strategic priorities for the island.\"Integrated Country Strategy,\" American Institute in Taiwan, 2022, https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ICS_EAP_Taiwan_Public.pdf. To support that objective, the United States can enhance Taiwan cybersecurity through cooperative defensive activities.\n\nFirst, US Cyber Command regularly supports the network resilience of allied countries and partners through its \"Hunt Forward\" operations, which are \"strictly defensive\" joint ventures, undertaken following an invitation from the ally or partner, to \"observe and detect malicious cyber activity\" on these networks, together searching out \"vulnerabilities, malware, and adversary presence.\"Franklin D. Kramer, The Sixth Domain: The Role of the Private Sector in Warfare, Atlantic Council, October 16, 2023, 13, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-sixth-domain-The-role-of-the-private-sector-in-warfare-Oct16.pdf.\n\nWhile Taiwan has not been specifically identified as a Hunt Forward participant, Anne Neuberger, who is the US deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, said at a Politico Tech Summit in 2023 that in the event of a major cyberattack on Taiwan, the United States would \"send its best teams to help hunt down the attackers, the same approach typically used to help global allies in cyberspace.\"Joseph Gedeon, \"Taiwan Is Bracing for Chinese Cyberattacks, White House Official Says,\" Politico, September 27, 2023, https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/27/taiwan-chinese-cyberattacks-white-house-00118492. She described the typical approach as:\n\nNeuberger also highlighted US work with Taiwan to carry out military tabletop games and exercises to prepare for potential cyberattack.Gedeon, \"Taiwan Is Bracing.\"\n\nMore recently, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2024 explicitly authorized the Defense Department to cooperate on:\n\nGoing forward, those authorities authorize not only Hunt Forward actions but also actions to leverage commercial and military technology to harden such networks (which would seem to resolve any export control issues) and to conduct combined training and exercises, all of which underscores clear congressional approval for enhanced cybersecurity activities with Taiwan.National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024.\n\nSecond, the United States should undertake to enhance Taiwan's communications resilience by making available access to US commercial and military LEO networks. The important role of the commercial provider Starlink in assuring communications in the context of the Ukraine-Russia war is well-known.According to a report by Emma Schroeder and Sean Dack, \"Starlink's performance in the Ukraine conflict demonstrated its high value for wartime satellite communications: Starlink, a network of low-orbit satellites working in constellations operated by SpaceX, relies on satellite receivers no larger than a backpack that are easily installed and transported. Because Russian targeting of cellular towers made communications coverage unreliable . . . the government 'made a decision to use satellite communication for such emergencies' from American companies like SpaceX. Starlink has proven more resilient than any other alternatives throughout the war. Due to the low orbit of Starlink satellites, they can broadcast to their receivers at relatively higher power than satellites in higher orbits. There has been little reporting on successful Russian efforts to jam Starlink transmissions.\" See Schroeder and Dack, A Parallel Terrain: Public-Private Defense of the Ukrainian Information Environment, Atlantic Council, February 2023, 14, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/A-Parallel-Terrain.pdf. Starlink's parent company, SpaceX, is, however, controlled by Elon Musk, whose Tesla company has major investments in China. That linkage has raised the question of whether Taiwan could rely on any commercial arrangements it might make on its own with Starlink -- particularly since Starlink did impose some limitations on Ukraine's use of the network.Joey Roulette, \"SpaceX Curbed Ukraine's Use of Starlink Internet for Drones: Company President,\" Reuters, February 9, 2023, https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/spacex-curbed-ukraines-use-starlink-internet-drones-company-president-2023-02-09/. However, as previously described by one of the authors of this report, the US government has sway on such matters:\n\nAccordingly, the US should rely on this authority to organize appropriate arrangements with Starlink -- and other space companies that provide like capabilities -- to ensure access that would support Taiwan communications. One way to do this would be to incorporate appropriate terms into the commercial augmentation space reserve (CASR) program arrangements that US Space Force is currently negotiating with civil space providers,Frank Kramer, Ann Dailey, and Joslyn Brodfuehrer, NATO Multidomain Operations: Near- and Medium-term Priority Initiatives, Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, Atlantic Council, March 2024, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NATO-multidomain-operations-Near-and-medium-term-priority-initiatives.pdf. as part of the Department of Defense's overall commercial space strategy.Department of Defense, \"Commercial Space Integration Strategy,\" 2024, https://media.defense.gov/2024/Apr/02/2003427610/-1/-1/1/2024-DOD-COMMERCIAL-SPACE-INTEGRATION-STRATEGY.PDF; and \"U.S. Space Force Commercial Space Strategy,\" US Space Force, April 8, 2024, https://www.spaceforce.mil//Portals/2/Documents/Space%20Policy/USSF_Commercial_Space_Strategy.pdf.\n\nAdditionally, the DOD is developing its own LEO capability through a variety of constellations being put in place by Space Force.\"Space Development Agency Successfully Launches Tranche 0 Satellites,\" Space Development Agency, September 2, 2023, https://www.sda.mil/space-development-agency-completes-second-successful-launch-of-tranche-0-satellites/. Pursuant to the recent NDAA authorization noted above, DOD should work with the Taiwan military to ensure that those constellations will be available to support Taiwan as necessary.\n\nLonger term, the United States should also undertake to enhance the resilience of Taiwan's undersea cables. As previously proposed by one of the authors, the United States should lead in establishing an international undersea infrastructure protection corps. It should:\n\nSuch an activity would include focus on cybersecurity for undersea cable networks, hardening and other protection for cable landing points, and capabilities and resources to ensure expeditious repair of cables as needed.Kramer, The Sixth Domain. To be sure, getting such an activity up and running will necessarily be a multiyear effort. However, Taiwan's vulnerability underscores the importance of beginning promptly and working as expeditiously as possible.\n\nAs part of its efforts to enhance resilience, Taiwan must mitigate its energy vulnerabilities, as its reliance on maritime imports for about 97 percent\"E-Stat,\" Energy Statistics Monthly Report, Energy Administration, Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs, accessed May 6, 2024, https://www.esist.org.tw/newest/monthly?tab=%E7%B6%9C%E5%90%88%E8%83%BD%E6%BA%90. of its energy needs creates acute risks. To lessen its dependency on maritime imports and strengthen its resiliency in the face of potential PRC coercion, Taiwan should curb energy and electricity demand, bolster indigenous supply, overhaul its inventory management, and prepare rationing plans. A resilient energy security approach would credibly signal to the PRC that Taiwan could hold out for long durations without maritime resupply.\n\nTaiwan's ultra-low electricity prices are a security risk (and a black eye for its climate targets). Reliance on seaborne energy shipments presents straightforward security problems, and Taiwan's low electricity prices subsidize consumption that is being met by imports of hydrocarbons, especially coal. The new Lai administration should make haste prudently, increasing electricity prices more frequently and significantly, without exceeding the limits of the politically possible.\n\nTaiwan's electricity price quandary is illustrated by Taipower, the state-owned monopoly utility. In 2022 and 2023, Taipower lost 227.2 billion New Taiwan dollars (NTD) and 198.5 billion NTD, respectively, as its per kilowatt hour cost of electricity sold substantially exceeded per unit prices.\"Comparison of Electricity Prices and Unit Cost Structures,\" Electricity Price Cost, Business Information, Information Disclosure, Taiwan Electric Power Co., accessed May 6, 2024, https://www.taipower.com.tw/tc/page.aspx?mid=196. Taipower's prices failed to offset the steep rise in electricity input costs amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the post-COVID-19 unsnarling of supply chains.\n\nTaiwan's electricity costs remain too low, diminishing the island's resiliency, although policymakers have now taken some steps in light of the problem. The Ministry of Economic Affairs' latest electricity price review, in March 2024, raised average prices by about 11 percent, with the new tariff reaching about 3.4518 NTD, or approximately $0.11 USD/kWh.Ministry of Economic Affairs (經濟部能源署), \"The Electricity Price Review Meeting,\" Headquarters News, accessed May 6, 2024, https://www.moea.gov.tw/MNS/populace/news/News.aspx?kind=1&menu_id=40&news_id=114222. This rationalization of prices, while welcome, is insufficient. In the United States, the rolling twelve-month ending price in January 2024 for all sectors totaled $0.127/kWh.\"Electric Power Monthly,\" US Energy Information Administration (EIA), February 2024, https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=table_5_03. Taiwan's heavily subsidized electricity consumers therefore enjoy a discount in excess of 13 percent compared to their US counterparts, despite US access to low-cost, abundant, and indigenously produced energy.\n\nTaiwan's heavily subsidized electricity prices incentivize maritime imports, especially coal. Astonishingly, Taiwan was the world's largest per capita user of coal generation for electricity in 2022, higher than even Australia, a major coal exporter.\n\nTaiwan's low electricity prices and use of coal expose the island to PRC economic coercion. Taiwan's dependency on imported coal heightens its vulnerability in the summer, when the island's electricity-generation needs peak. Concerningly, Taiwan has already experienced electricity shortfalls in summer peacetime conditions, including a wave of outagesLauly Li and Cheng Ting-Feng, \"Taiwan's Frequent Blackouts Expose Vulnerability of Tech Economy,\" Nikkei Asia, August 30, 2022, https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Taiwan-s-frequent-blackouts-expose-vulnerability-of-tech-economy. between July and August 2022. With the island's future summer cooling needs set to rise even further due to climate change and hotter temperatures, Taiwan's electricity needs pose a vulnerability that the PRC may attempt to exploit.\n\nCurbing Taiwan's electricity demand during summer months is critical, necessitating a rise in prices. While this reduction is a principal energy security challenge, the island must also do more to secure supply, especially for nuclear energy.\n\nTaiwan's resiliency will be strengthened by producing as much indigenous energy as possible, especially during the critical summer months. Taiwan, which has virtually no hydrocarbon resources, can therefore indigenously produce only four different forms of energy at scale: nuclear energy, offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar. Taiwan should pursue each of these indigenous energy sources. Taiwan should apply \"carrots\" by strengthening incentives and payments for indigenous production. At the same time, applying the \"stick\" of higher prices to energy consumption, especially for energy imports, would bolster the island's resiliency.\n\nTaiwan's renewable resources are significant and often economically viable, but they cannot secure adequate levels of resiliency by themselves. Taiwan's wind speeds slow in the summer,Xi Deng et al., \"Offshore Wind Power in China: A Potential Solution to Electricity Transformation and Carbon Neutrality,\" Fundamental Research, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fmre.2022.11.008. limiting onshore and offshore wind's effectiveness in bolstering energy security. Additionally, Taiwan's stringent localization requirements for offshore appropriately minimize PRC components and sensors in Taiwan's offshore wind turbines, but also raise the costs of this technology. Taiwan's solar potential\"Global Solar Atlas,\" World Bank Group, ESMAP, and Solar GIS, 2024, CC BY 4.0, https://globalsolaratlas.info/map?c=24.176825. is also limitedJulian Spector, \"Taiwan's Rapid Renewables Push Has Created a Bustling Battery Market,\" Canary Media, April 6, 2023, https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/taiwans-rapid-renewables-push-has-created-a-bustling-battery-market. by cloudy skies, frequent rainfall, and land scarcity.\n\nAccordingly, nuclear energy is the most viable way for Taiwan to address its summer electricity needs without turning to maritime imports. While Taiwan's nuclear reactors must acquire fuel from abroad, this fuel can be used for approximately eighteen to twenty-four months.\"U.S. Nuclear Plant Outages Increased in September After Remaining Low during Summer,\" Today in Energy, US EIA, October 18, 2015, https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37252#:~:text=Nuclear%20power%20plants%20typically%20refuel. Taiwan should maintain its existing nuclear energy capacity; restart retired capacity as soon as politically and technically feasible; and seek new, incremental capacity over time.For a more detailed discussion of Taiwan's indigenous supply, see Joseph Webster, \"Does Taiwan's Massive Reliance on Energy Imports Put Its Security at Risk?,\" New Atlanticist, Atlantic Council blog, July 7, 2023, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/does-taiwans-massive-reliance-on-energy-imports-put-its-security-at-risk/.\n\nTo cope with various contingencies, including the possibility of a prolonged summertime blockade, Taiwan should increase its stockpiles of energy, disperse inventory around the island, and harden facilities.\n\nWhile Taiwan's ability to hold out against a blockade involves by many factors, energy inventories are a critical element. Taiwan's electricity reserves are limited: it reported fifty-six days of supply of coal inventories in February 2023,\"The Current Situation and Future of [the] Country's Energy Supply and Reserves (立法院),\" Seventh Session of the Tenth Legislative Yuan, Sixth Plenary Meeting of the Economic Committee, accessed May 7, 2024, https://ppg.ly.gov.tw/ppg/SittingAttachment/download/2023030989/02291301002301567002.pdf. and aims to raise its natural gas inventories from eleven days to more than twenty days by 2030.Jeanny Kao and Yimou Lee, \"Taiwan to Boost Energy Inventories amid China Threat,\" ed. Gerry Doyle, Reuters, October 23, 2022, https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/taiwan-boost-energy-inventories-amid-china-threat-2022-10-24/. These inventory levels should be expanded, in part because \"days of supply\" fail to encapsulate uncertainty. Demand fluctuates depending on temperature and other variables, while Taiwan's access to energy storage inventories faces the risk of sabotage and, in certain scenarios, kinetic strikes.\n\nTaiwan's management of petroleum reserves is a matter of great importance, given the use of these fuels, especially diesel, for military matters. Taiwan's Energy Administration, in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, reported in April 2024 that its total oil inventories stood at 167 days of supply.Energy Administration, \"Domestic Oil Reserves Monthly Data (國內石油安全存量月資料),\" Ministry of Economic Affairs, accessed May 6, 2024, https://www.moeaea.gov.tw/ecw/populace/content/wfrmStatistics.aspx?type=4&menu_id=1302. This topline figure presents an overly optimistic portrait of Taiwan's petroleum security, however. For instance, Taiwan's government-controlled inventories in April 2024Energy Administration, Ministry of Economic Affairs. included 2.6 million kiloliters of crude oil and refined products; private stocks added another 6.5 million kiloliters. Accordingly, Taiwan reports forty-seven days of supply from government stockpiles, with an additional 120 days from private inventories.Energy Administration, Ministry of Economic Affairs. Given that domestic sales and consumption equated to about 54,200 kiloliters per day from prior comparable periods,Energy Administration, Ministry of Economic Affairs. Taiwan calculated it had about 167 days of supply.\n\nThere may, however, be insufficient monitoring of private inventories. Marek Jestrab observed:\n\nWhile Taiwan should ensure that stockpiles are actually on the island, and not at sea, it also needs to carefully examine the inventory split between crude oil and crude products, such as diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, etc. Additionally, Taiwan's policymakers should not expect to rely on its crude inventories, which only have a latent potential: crude oil cannot be used until it is refined into a crude product. Therefore, if the PRC disrupted Taiwan's refineries via cyber or even kinetic means, Taiwan would not be able to access the totality of its crude oil reserves.\n\nTaiwan's military requirements for fuel would likely surge during a confrontation or conflict with the PRC, reducing the \"days of supply.\" Since Taiwan's military vehicles largely run on diesel, the island should pay careful attention to this product.\n\nTaiwan should disperse and harden its energy assets, especially diesel storage, as concentrated objects would present inviting targets for the PRC. Beijing is studying Russia's invasion of Ukraine closely and will not fail to notice that Moscow attacked about 30 percent of Ukrainian infrastructure in a single day.Kathleen Magramo et al., \"October 11, 2022 Russia-Ukraine News,\" CNN, October 11, 2022, https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-10-11-22/index.html. As one author witnessed during his recent visit to Kyiv, Ukraine's dispersal of electricity assets is achieving a reasonable degree of success. Indeed, Russia's more recent campaignTom Balforth, \"Major Russian Air Strikes Destroy Kyiv Power Plant, Damage Other Stations,\" Reuters, November 2024, https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-missile-strike-targets-cities-across-ukraine-2024-04-11/#:~:text=KYIV%2C%20April%2011%20(Reuters),runs%20low%20on%20air%20defences. attacking large-scale thermal and hydroelectric power plants illustrates the utility of dispersed energy infrastructure. Like Ukraine, Taiwan should disperse and harden its energy storage inventories to the maximal feasible extent.\n\nWhile both Taiwan's electricity supply and demand will be very hard to predict in a state of emergency, rationing plans must be considered -- especially for the island's manufacturing and semiconductor industries.\n\nTaiwan's economy is uniquelyGlobal Taiwan Institute, \"Taiwan's Electrical Grid and the Need for Greater System Resilience,\" June 14, 2023, https://globaltaiwan.org/2023/06/taiwans-electrical-grid-and-the-need-for-greater-system-resilience/. tied to electricity-intensive manufacturing, as industrial consumers accounted for more than 55 percent of Taiwan's electricity consumption in 2023.\"3-04 Electricity Consumption (3-04 電力消費),\" Taiwan Energy Statistics Monthly Report (能源統計月報), accessed May 6, 2024, https://www.esist.org.tw/newest/monthly?tab=%E9%9B%BB%E5%8A%9B. Most of these industrial producers (such as chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) service export markets -- not Taiwan. While the PRC might attempt to disrupt the island's energy and electricity supply via cyber and kinetic means, Taiwan's electricity consumption would fall dramatically during a crisis if Taiwan's industries were forced to shut down. Although the closure of Taiwan's industry would prove economically ruinous, it would also make the island's electricity and energy issues much more manageable. Adding an additional layer of complication, many of Taiwan's most valuable exports - such as chips - are shipped via civilian airliners, not on seaborne vessels, and would consequently be more difficult to interdict in circumstances short of war.Alperovitch, D. (2024, June 6). A Chinese economic blockade of Taiwan would fail or launch a war. War on the Rocks. https://warontherocks.com/2024/06/a-chinese-economic-blockade-of-taiwan-would-fail-or-launch-a-war/ Taiwan should prepare rationing plans for a variety of contingencies, adapting to a range of scenarios, including a quarantine, siege, or even kinetic conflict. Taiwan must be ready.\n\nEver since Beijing leveraged then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi's August 2022 visit to Taiwan as an excuse to launch large-scale joint blockade military exercises, pundits have labeled the residual military situation around Taiwan as a \"new normal.\" Yet there is really nothing normal about a permanent presence of People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy warships menacingly surrounding the island along its twenty-four nautical mile contiguous zone, and nothing usual about increasing numbers of manned and unmanned military aircraft crossing the tacit median line in the Taiwan Strait -- a line that held significance for seven decades as a symbol of cross-strait stability. Nor should it be viewed as normal that a steady stream of high-altitude surveillance balloons -- which are suspected of collecting military intelligence -- violate Taiwan's airspace.\"The Ministry of National Defense Issues a Press Release Explaining Reports That 'Airborne Balloons by the CCP Had Continuously Flown over Taiwan,' \" Taiwan Ministry of National Defense, January 6, 2024, https://www.mnd.gov.tw/english/Publish.aspx?title=News%20Channel&SelectStyle=Defense%20News%20&p=82479. Some have better described this \"new normal\" as a strategy akin to an anaconda noticeably tightening its grip around the island, drawing close enough to reduce warning time and provocative enough to raise the risk of inadvertent clashes. In other words, the PRC has unilaterally dialed up a military cost-imposition campaign meant to chip away at peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, wear down Taiwan's military, and erode confidence and social cohesion in Taiwan society.\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was an additional wake-up call for the citizens of Taiwan, following mainland China's 2019 crackdown on Hong Kong freedoms, heightening recognition of the risks presented by the PRC and, in particular, that the long-standing status quo in cross-strait relations is no longer acceptable to Beijing. Taiwan thus finds itself in the unenviable position of simultaneously countering PLA gray zone intrusions and cognitive warfare -- what NATO calls affecting attitudes and behaviors to gain advantage\"Cognitive Warfare,\" Allied Command Transformation, NATO, accessed May 24, 2024, https://www.act.nato.int/activities/cognitive-warfare/#:~:text=NORFOLK%2C%20VA%20%E2%80%93%20Cognitive%20Warfare%20includes,an%20advantage%20over%20an%20adversary. -- while beefing itself up militarily to deter the growing threat of a blockade or assault.\n\nWith this backdrop, Taipei authorities have since embarked on long-overdue reforms in defense affairs, marked by several developments aimed at bolstering the island democracy's military capabilities and readiness in the face of growing threats from Beijing.\n\nFirst, Taiwan's overall defense spending has undergone seven consecutive year-on-year increases, reaching 2.5 percent of gross domestic product.\"Taiwan Announces an Increased Defense Budget for 2024,\" Global Taiwan Institute, September 20, 2023, https://globaltaiwan.org/2023/09/taiwan-announces-an-increased-defense-budget-for-2024/. While this is commendable, Taiwan's defense requirements are very substantial, and its budget in US dollars is only $19.1 billion.Yu Nakamura, \"Taiwan Allots Record Defense Budget for 2024 to Meet China Threat,\" Nikkei Asia, August 24, 2023, https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Defense/Taiwan-allots-record-defense-budget-for-2024-to-meet-China-threat. Accordingly, it will be important for Taiwan to continue the trend of higher defense spending to at least 3 percent of GDP both to bolster Taiwan's military capabilities and as a deterrent signal to Beijing -- and also to garner international community recognition that Taiwan is serious about its own defense. A key element will be to ensure that Taiwan has sufficient stocks of ammunition and other weapons capabilities to fight effectively until the United States could fully engage and in the event of a longer war. One area that deserves a high degree of attention is defense against ballistic and cruise missiles and unmanned vehicles. Especially in light of the recent coalition success in defeating such Iranian attacks against Israel, planning should be undertaken to assure comparable success for Taiwan against PRC attacks. Adding mobile, short-range air defenses to the high-priority list of military investments for Taiwan -- such as the highly mobile National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS)\"NASAMS: National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System,\" Raytheon, accessed May 12, 2024, https://www.rtx.com/raytheon/what-we-do/integrated-air-and-missile-defense/nasams. -- will make it harder for the PLA to find and destroy Taiwan defenses, especially if combined with passive means for target detection and missile guidance.\n\nSecond, the new president can kick-start an enhanced approach to defense by embracing full integration of public-private innovation and adopting Ukraine's model of grass-roots innovation for defense, which has served it well through a decade of war against a much larger Russia. Recognizing that innovation is itself a form of resilience, Taiwan can draw valuable lessons from Ukraine, particularly in leveraging private-sector expertise. By implementing what some Ukrainian defense experts term a \"capability accelerator\" to integrate emerging technologies into mission-focused capabilities, Taiwan can enhance its resilience and swiftly adapt to evolving security challenges, including rapidly fielding a high volume of unmanned systems to achieve distributed surveillance, redundant command and control, and higher survivability.Lopatin, \"Bind Ukraine's Military-Technology Revolution.\" This comprehensive approach, which recognizes the private sector as the greatest source of innovation in today's complex security environment, holds significant potential for enhancing Taiwan's defense capabilities through the utilization of disruptive technologies. The island's overall resilience would significantly benefit by drawing the private sector in as a direct stakeholder in national defense matters.\n\nUkraine's grass-roots model of defense innovation, spearheaded by volunteers, nongovernment organizations, and international partners, is a worthy and timely model for Taiwan. Ukraine's approach has yielded significant advancements in drone warfare, as well as sophisticated capabilities like the Delta battlefield management system -- a user-friendly cloud-based situational awareness tool that provides real-time information on enemy and friendly forces through the integration of data from sources such as drones, satellites, and even civilian reports.Grace Jones, Janet Egan, and Eric Rosenbach, \"Advancing in Adversity: Ukraine's Battlefield Technologies and Lessons for the U.S.,\" Policy Brief, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School, July 31, 2023, https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/advancing-adversity-ukraines-battlefield-technologies-and-lessons-us. This collaborative model, reliant on cooperation between civilian developers and military end users, has propelled Ukraine's military technological revolution by integrating intelligence and surveillance tasks, while enhancing decision-making and kill-chain target acquisition. Taiwan will benefit from a comparable approach.\n\nThird, as suggested above, Taiwan should focus a large portion of its defense budget on low-cost, highly effective systems. In terms of force structure, it appears that Taiwan has settled on a design that blends large legacy platforms of a twentieth-century military with the introduction of more survivable and distributable low-end asymmetric capabilities. The latter are best exemplified by Taiwan's indigenously produced Ta Chiang-class of high-speed, guided-missile corvettes (PGG) and Min Jiang-class fast mine laying boats (FMLB).For more information, see, e.g., Peter Suciu, \"Future of Taiwan's Navy: Inside the Tuo Chiang-Class Missile Corvettes,\" National Interest, March 27, 2024, https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/future-taiwans-navy-inside-tuo-chiang-class-missile-corvettes-210269; and Xavier Vavasseur, \"Taiwan Launches 1st Mine Laying Ship for ROC Navy,\" Naval News, August 5, 2020, https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2020/08/taiwan-launches-1st-mine-laying-ship-for-roc-navy/. But much more must be done to bolster Taiwan's overall defense capabilities by focusing on less expensive, but nonetheless highly effective systems.\n\nIn Ukraine's battle against Russian Federation invaders, drones have provided Ukrainian forces with important tactical capabilities by enabling them to gather intelligence, monitor enemy movements, and conduct precision strikes on high-value targets. Taiwan can comparably utilize low-cost UAVs to establish mesh networks that connect devices for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and for targeting that would be invaluable in countering a PRC amphibious assault. Lessons from Ukraine further highlight the importance of having the right mix of drone types and capabilities in substantial stockpiles, capable of a variety of missions. Notably, Ukrainian officials have called for the production of more than one million domestically produced drones in 2024.Mykola Bielieskov, \"Outgunned Ukraine Bets on Drones as Russian Invasion Enters Third Year,\" Ukraine Alert, Atlantic Council blog, February 20, 2024, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/outgunned-ukraine-bets-on-drones-as-russian-invasion-enters-third-year/. Then-President Tsai's formation of a civilian-led \"drone national team\" program is a commendable step in this direction and underscores the power of collaborative innovation in joint efforts between users.Yimou Lee, James Pomfret, and David Lague, \"Inspired by Ukraine War, Taiwan Launches Drone Blitz to Counter China,\" Reuters, July 21, 2023, https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/us-china-tech-taiwan/. Encouraging cooperation between Taiwan drone makers and US private industry will accelerate the development of a combat-ready unmanned systems fleet with sufficient range, endurance, and payload to enhance situational awareness and battlefield effects.\n\nConcurrent with those efforts utilizing unmanned systems, Taiwan should bolster its naval mining capabilities as a strategic measure against PRC aggression. Naval mines represent one of the most cost-effective and immediately impactful layers of defense.Franklin D. Kramer and Lt. Col. Matthew R. Crouch, Transformative Priorities for National Defense, Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, Atlantic Council, 2021, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Transformative-Priorities-Report-2021.pdf. In this regard, Taiwan's new Min Jiang class of FMLB represents the right type of investments in capabilities which could prove pivotal in thwarting potential invasion attempts.\n\nEven more significantly for a Taiwan audience, Ukraine broke a blockade of its Black Sea ports using a combination of naval drones and coastal defense missiles -- and repelled the once-mighty Russian Black Sea Fleet -- all without a traditional navy of its own.Peter Dickinson, \"Ukraine's Black Sea Success Exposes Folly of West's 'Don't Escalate' Mantra,\" Ukraine Alert, Atlantic Council, January 22, 2024, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/ukraines-black-sea-success-provides-a-blueprint-for-victory-over-putin/. Faced with clear intent by a PLA Navy practicing daily to isolate the island, the time is past due for Taiwanese authorities to hone their own counterblockade skills including a heavy reliance on unmanned surface vehicles.\n\nTaiwan should also make rapid investments in port infrastructure and defenses along Taiwan's eastern seaboard in places such as Su'ao and Hualien harbors, which can serve as deepwater ports that are accessible, strategic, antiblockade strongpoints, and where any conceivable PLA blockade would be at its weakest and most vulnerable point logistically. Su'ao harbor, as a potential future homeport for Taiwan's new indigenous Hai Kun-class diesel submarines, could also serve a dual purpose as an experimentation and development zone for public-private collaboration on unmanned-systems employment and operations. Infrastructure investments in East Coast ports could enhance the island's ability to attain emergency resupply of energy, food, humanitarian supplies, and munitions under all conditions, broadening options for international community aid and complicating PLA efforts.\n\nFourth, every new capability needs trained operators who are empowered to employ and engage. This year Taiwan began implementation of a new, one-year conscript training system for male adults born after January 1, 2005 (up from a wholly inadequate four months of conscription in the past decade).Ministry of National Defense, ROC National Security Defense Report 2023, https://www.mnd.gov.tw/newupload/ndr/112/112ndreng.pdf. Taiwan's \"all-out defense\" plan realigns into a frontline main battle force consisting of all-volunteer career military personnel, backed up by a standing garrison force composed mainly of conscripted military personnel guarding infrastructure, along with a civil defense system integrated with local governments and private-sector resources. Upon mobilization, there would also be a reserve force to supplement the main battle and garrison forces.\n\nAccording to details laid out in its 2023 National Defense Report, Taiwan's revamped one-year conscript system and reorganized reserve mobilization system place significant emphasis on traditional military combat skills, such as rifle marksmanship and operation of mortars.Ministry of National Defense, ROC National Security Defense Report 2023. However, in response to evolving security challenges and the changing nature of warfare, Taiwan's military should incorporate greater training in emerging technologies and unconventional tactics, along with decentralized command and control, especially in the areas of drone warfare, where unmanned aerial vehicles and surface vessels play a crucial role in reconnaissance, surveillance, and targeted strikes. By integrating drone warfare training into the conscript system as well as in annual reserve call-up training, Taiwan can better prepare its military personnel to adapt to modern battlefield environments and effectively counter emerging threats.\n\nIntegrating drone operations into military operations down to the conscript and reservist level offers a cost-effective means to enhance battlefield situational awareness and operational capabilities, and also has the added benefit of enhancing the attractiveness and value of a mandatory conscription system emerging from years of low morale and characterized by Taiwan's outgoing president as \"insufficient\" and \"full of outmoded training.\"\"President Tsai Announces Military Force Realignment Plan,\" Office of the President, December 27, 2022, https://english.president.gov.tw/NEWS/6417. Recognizing the imperative to modernize military training to face up to a rapidly expanding PLA threat, Taiwan's military force realignment plan came with a promise to \"include training in the use of Stinger missiles, Javelin missiles, Kestrel rockets, drones, and other new types of weapons . . . in accordance with mission requirements to meet the needs of modern warfare.\"\"President Tsai Announces Military Force Realignment Plan.\" Looking at the example of Ukraine, where drones have been utilized, underscores the importance of incorporating drone warfare training into its asymmetric strategy.\n\nThe Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act \"prioritize[d] realistic training\" by the United States, with Taiwan authorizing \"an enduring rotational United States military presence that assists Taiwan in maintaining force readiness.\"International Military Education and Training Cooperation with Taiwan, 22 U.S.C. § 3353 (2022), https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/3353. There have been numerous reports of US special forces in Taiwan,Guy D. McCardl, \"US Army Special Forces to Be Deployed on Taiwanese Island Six Miles from Mainland China,\" SOFREP, March 8, 2024, https://sofrep.com/news/us-army-special-forces-to-be-deployed-on-taiwanese-island-six-miles-from-mainland-china/. and those forces could provide training in tactical air control, dynamic targeting, urban warfare, and comparable capabilities.\"Taiwan Defense Issues for Congress,\" Congressional Research Service, CRS Report R48044, updated May 10, 2024, https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R48044. Likewise, parts of an Army Security Force Assistance Brigade could do similar work on a rotational basis, on- or off-island.\n\nTo facilitate a comprehensive and integrated approach to defense planning and preparedness between the military, government agencies, and civilian organizations, Taiwan has also established the All-out Defense Mobilization Agency, which (as noted above) is a centralized body subordinate to the Ministry of National Defense that is tasked with coordinating efforts across various sectors, down to the local level, to enhance national defense readiness. That agency would be significantly more effective if raised to the national level with a broadened mandate as part of a comprehensive approach.\n\nThe Taiwanese leadership also should consider elevating their efforts to create a large-scale civil defense force, offering practical skills training which would appeal to Taiwanese willing to dedicate time and effort toward defense of their communities and localities. These skills could include emergency medical training, casualty evacuation, additive manufacturing, drone flying, and open-source intelligence. Private, nonprofit civil defense organizations such as Taiwan's Kuma Academy hold widespread appeal to citizens seeking to enhance basic preparedness skills.Jordyn Haime, \"NGOs Try to Bridge Taiwan's Civil Defense Gap,\" China Project, August 4, 2023, https://thechinaproject.com/2023/08/04/ngos-try-to-bridge-taiwans-civil-defense-gap/. With a curriculum that covers topics ranging from basic first aid to cognitive warfare, Kuma Academy's popular classes typically sell out within minutes of going online. According to a recent survey of domestic Taiwan opinions sponsored by Spirit of America, \"When facing external threats, 75.3% of the people agree that Taiwanese citizens have an obligation to defend Taiwan.\"Spirit of America, Taiwan Civic Engagement Survey, January 2024. A well-trained civil defense force and other whole-of-society resilience measures provide an additional layer of defense and enhance social cohesion to better deny Beijing's ultimate political objective of subjugating the will of the people.\n\nOn April 3, 2024, Taiwan was struck by the strongest earthquake in twenty-five years. In the face of this magnitude 7.4 quake, Taiwan's response highlights the effectiveness of robust investment in stricter building codes, earthquake alert systems, and resilience policies, resulting in minimal casualties and low infrastructure damage.Amy Hawkins and Chi Hui Lin, \"'As Well Prepared as They Could Be': How Taiwan Kept Death Toll Low in Massive Earthquake,\" Observer, April 7, 2024, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/07/as-well-prepared-as-they-could-be-how-taiwan-kept-death-toll-low-in-massive-earthquake. Taiwan's precarious position on the seismically vulnerable Ring of Fire, a belt of volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean, mirrors its vulnerability under constant threat of military and gray zone aggression from a mainland China seeking seismic changes in geopolitical power. Drawing from its success in preparing for and mitigating the impact of natural disasters, Taiwan can apply a similarly proactive approach in its defense preparedness. Safeguarding Taiwan's sovereignty and security requires investments in a comprehensive security strategy for resilience across society -- including cybersecurity for critical infrastructures, bolstering energy security, and enhanced defense resilience. Such an approach would provide Taiwan the greatest likelihood of deterring or, if necessary, defeating PRC aggression including through blockade or kinetic conflict.\n\nFranklin D.

        "body": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán arrived in Kyiv Tuesday for talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in his first visit to the country since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe visit aimed to discuss peace possibilities and bilateral relations between Hungary and Ukraine, a relationship strained by Orbán's controversial stance on the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nOrbán's visit follows Hungary's assumption of the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union on July 1, 2024. This leadership role comes amid widespread concern over Hungary's democratic backsliding and its close ties with Russia. Known as one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies within the EU, Orban has frequently obstructed the bloc's efforts to support Ukraine and impose sanctions on Moscow.\n\nHungarian officials have stated that they will act as \"honest brokers\" in the EU Council leadership position.\n\nCritics of the Hungarian government say that it has centralized power, restricted media freedom, weakened judicial independence and altered electoral laws in order to benefit the Fidesz party, of which Orbán is the leader.\n\nInternational bodies, including the EU, have expressed concerns that these actions undermine the principles of democracy.\n\nThe bloc has frozen more than $20 billion in funding to Budapest over alleged rule-of-law and corruption violations, according to the Associated Press. Orbán has initiated numerous anti-EU communications campaigns where the body is depicted as repressive and overcentralized.\n\nWhile Hungary is not the only nation to hold back from condemning the war on Ukraine, it's stance is very different to many EU and NATO members. It has taken a mostly neutral position, pushing a generic message of peace.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to a representative of the Hungarian government via email for comment.\n\nAccording to Orbán's spokesperson, Zoltan Kovacs, who confirmed Orbán was in Kyiv, the focus of discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on achieving peace and addressing issues in Hungarian-Ukrainian relations.\n\nOrbán has criticized Ukraine for what Budapest describes as inadequate protections for the rights of its Hungarian minority, Politico reported.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to a representative of the Ukrainian government via email for comment on the visit.\n\nThe visit follows an unofficial meeting between the two leaders on June 27. During the European Council summit in Brussels that day, Orbán and Zelensky were seen having what was described as an animated and frank discussion.\n\nOrbán's visit could signal a potential thaw in Hungarian-Ukrainian relations, especially as Ukraine continues to push for EU membership and greater support from European allies. As Hungary holds the EU presidency for the next six months, its role could influence the bloc's policies towards Ukraine and the broader geopolitical landscape. Observers will be watching closely to see if this visit leads to any substantive changes in Hungary's stance or EU policies.",

        "body": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban arrived in Kyiv, Ukraine on Tuesday morning to promote a peace process, the day after he took over the Presidency of the European Council.\n\nViktor Orban took over the rotating presidency of the European Council on Monday, vowing to work for peace in Europe during his term, and promptly took up the longstanding invitation to travel to Kyiv from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a surprise trip Tuesday morning.\n\nA press spokesman for Mr Orban said of his intentions for the day, which will include talks with President Zelensky, statements, but no press conference: \"The most important topic of the discussion is the possibility of creating peace\". He said they would also discuss Hungarian-Ukrainian bilateral relations, which have tended to be reasonably poor in the past, Budapest accusing Kyiv of mistreating the nation's small Hungarian minority in its south-West.\n\nThis issue has also long been a sticking point in Ukraine's attempts to join the European Union, along with addressing corruption and the influence of oligarchs. The bloc opened formal membership talks with Kyiv last week, a major boost for the country.\n\nHungary's Orban has made clear working for peace in Europe will be the major focus of his time at the top of the European Council, the club of EU member state heads of state, which is chaired by a rotating presidency. On Monday as he took over the role from the Belgians, Mr Orban said the Russia-Ukraine war is the greatest threat presently facing Europe and said he wanted to be sure the continent is ready for what comes next.\n\nArticulating his view that President Trump will be the next U.S. President and will impose a ceasefire on Russia and Ukraine within days of taking office, which he says he believes will lead to peace negotiations, Orban warns of a situation where the United States and Russia negotiate between themselves on the future of a European nation without European leaders being at the table.\n\nSo while Orban's talk of peace is deeply unpopular among some European leaders, and has led to accusations of him being a Russian puppet, he insists being ready for such an outcome would be in the continent's interests. He said on Monday, per Hungarian media: \"Europe must prepare for the situation that sooner or later the Americans and the Russians will negotiate with each other... Where will Europe be in this [situation]? Who will represent your interests? What are your interests anyway?\".",

        "title": "3 Defense Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash & Burn",
        "body": "Geopolitical turmoil continues unabated. There is no end in sight for the conflict raging in Gaza, and similar can be said about the Russia-Ukraine war. Unfortunate though true, a world embroiled in various clashes does create an opportunity to invest in defense stocks. The companies behind these \"Defense\" stocks sell weapons, defense systems, armored vehicles and drones to the U.S. government as well as its allies.\n\nThe iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEBATS:ITA), for example, is a $6.1 billion exchange-traded fund that has investments in 39 different. public aerospace firms and defense contracts. The ETF has seen a resurgence since early October last year and is up more than 22% since then.\n\nOf course, not all defense firms are a sure bet these days. Below are 3 clear defense stocks that investors should sell before their share prices crash and burn.\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nThe plane-maker and defense contractor Boeing (NYSE:BA) cannot seem to stay out of major headlines. In January, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737-MAX-9 plane suffered an emergency door blowout that catapulted a series of investigations into the plane-maker's manufacturing quality and scale capabilities. Shortly after the incident, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) started a high-profile investigation. And on the FAA's website, they have written, \"[the agency] has halted production expansion of the Boeing 737 MAX, is exploring the use of a third party to conduct independent reviews of quality systems.\" Similarly, in early May, the FAA has also began a probe into the production quality of Boeing's long-haul 787 Dreamliner jets. A model type that Boeing employees have been accused of falsifying safety documents.\n\nMost recently, the U.S Justice Department has offered a plea deal to the company for its role in the 2018 and 2019 737-MAX crashes, after the plane-maker had originally received a deferred prosecution agreement that had temporarily shielded it from criminal charges.\n\nBoeing's share price has been amongst the worst performers in the industrial sector. The plane-maker's share price has plummeted more than 30% since the start of the year. Ongoing investigations, a potential criminal prosecution and further finding of criminal negligence could send shares plummeting even more.\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR)\n\nArcher Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) is an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) manufacturer. eVTOL vehicles will be an interesting space within the urban transportation sector that investors should watch out for with enthusiasm. The idea is to provide travelers with an alternative, futuristic way in which to travel about a large urban dwelling. Most recently, the FAA has awarded Archer Aviation's \"Midnight\" eVTOL with a significant certificate that will allow it to fly commercially. This was after two long years of filing various documents. Archer Aviation's Midnight is a four-passenger aircraft with a range of 100 miles.\n\nHowever, Archer Aviation's stock price has been disappointing. Shares have fallen 42.7% on a year-to-date basis. While Archer does have a partnership with United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), which has ordered several of Archer's eVTOL aircrafts, there is a lot of competition in the space, from Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY), for example, and a lack of a pathway to profitability could keep shares trending downward.\n\nMercury Systems (MRCY)\n\nMercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY) is the final defense company to make this sell-list. In short, the firm manufactures and sells components, products, modules and subsystems to various companies within the defense and aerospace industry. Moreover, Mercury offers a variety of semiconductor components, including transceivers, switches and amplifiers as well as integrated circuit chips that compose different military technologies.\n\nUnfortunately, Mercury has also suffered from a plummeting stock price and declining earnings. In particular, MRCY shares fell 26.2% for the year as of the end of trading last Friday. At the end of 2023, Mercury management had seen its revenue and earnings decline for its Q2 2024 results due to elevated program and manufacturing costs. Furthermore, Mercury missed Wall Street estimates in their Q3 2024 earnings report.\n\nMore dreadful earnings seasons could send MRCY shares plummeting even more than it has currently, which should signal to current investors that MRCY is one of the defense stocks they will want to sell while they still can.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "summary": "The article advises investors to sell three specific defense stocks in July due to potential significant declines. The stocks in question are Boeing (BA), Archer Aviation (ACHR), and Mercury Systems (MRCY).\n\n1. **Boeing (BA)**: The company is facing multiple investigations by the FAA and the U.S. Justice Department related to manufacturing quality and safety issues, including the 737-MAX and 787 Dreamliner jets. Boeing's stock has already dropped over 30% this year, and ongoing legal and regulatory challenges could lead to further declines.\n\n2. **Archer Aviation (ACHR)**: Despite receiving FAA certification for its \"Midnight\" eVTOL aircraft and a partnership with United Airlines, Archer's stock has fallen 42.7% year-to-date. The company faces stiff competition and lacks a clear path to profitability, which could continue to negatively impact its stock price.\n\n3. **Mercury Systems (MRCY)**: The company has experienced a 26.2% drop in stock price this year due to declining earnings and missed Wall Street estimates. Increased program and manufacturing costs have further strained its financial performance, suggesting more potential declines.\n\nThe article concludes that these stocks are risky investments and should be sold before their prices potentially crash further."

        "body": "Footage and images posted online appear to depict a squad of Russian troops on motorbikes coming under attack from Ukrainian forces.\n\nA video montage showed Russian tanks, armored vehicles and motorcycles engaged by Ukrainian drones and strikes. Images accompanying the video show over a dozen motorcycles scattered around an armored vehicle along a dirt road. The text at the end of the video lists targets \"destroyed\" by the \"Black Zaporozhians\" (a.k.a. Ukraine's 72 Mechanized Brigade), which includes 16 tanks and 19 motorcycles.\n\nThe video and images were posted online by Anton Gerashchenko, who has served as an adviser to Ukraine's internal affairs minister. Newsweek contacted the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministries for comment.\n\nThe post read: \"Vuhledar direction, Russian losses courtesy of Ukrainian Warriors from the 72 Separate Mechanized Brigade.\n\n\"Note the large number of burned and destroyed Russian motorcycles, sent into combat together with heavy equipment - the Russian soldiers were sent into the meat grinder consciously.\"\n\nUkrainian officials on Monday claimed that Russia lost its highest-ever number of artillery systems in a one-month period. An official post from the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that 1,415 Russian artillery systems were destroyed in June, which it said was a record since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nKyiv also claimed that 1,160 artillery systems were destroyed in May, putting Moscow's artillery losses at around 14,600.\n\nThe posts didn't clarify where the data used in the report originated, however. Russia doesn't publish its military losses, and analysts are skeptical of reports by both sides.\n\nUkraine also claimed Russia suffered its second-highest monthly personnel losses in June - 35,030 soldiers.\n\nThe British government estimated in May that Russia's total casualties had likely reached half a million.\n\nMoscow's forces are pushing to make significant gains in eastern Ukraine, and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which comprise the Donbas area, are suffering constant shelling. Russia's tactics include digging tunnels to get behind enemy lines and launch attacks, according to its defense ministry.\n\nUkraine has also been focusing its efforts on the occupied Crimean peninsula, which it has pledged to retake.\n\nRussia has accused Ukrainian forces of using U.S.-made ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) to attack targets in Crimea. The Russian Union of Travel Industry (RUTI) said Sunday that there had been a 25 to 30 percent decline in bookings in Crimea after debris from Ukrainian missiles intercepted by air defenses landed on a beach in the port city of Sevastopol on June 23.\n\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

        "body": "After Supreme Court immunity ruling, Biden draws sharp contrast with Trump on obeying rule of law\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden warns that a Supreme Court ruling granting presidents broad immunity from prosecution would make an unchecked Republican Donald Trump \"more emboldened to do whatever he wants\" if he regains the White House in November's election. Biden has been under intense pressure after his disastrous debate performance against Trump last week. He urged Americans on Monday to think carefully about their election decision and signaled he had no intention of dropping out of the race. Biden's effort to reset his campaign following his performance, which spooked donors and stirred up major Democratic anxiety, has been looking a lot like his past attempts to keep the focus squarely on Trump's misdeeds and shortcomings.\n\nTrump seeks to set aside New York hush money verdict hours after Supreme Court ruling\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's lawyers have sent a letter to the Manhattan judge in his hush money criminal case seeking permission to file a motion to set aside the verdict. The letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan cited the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling earlier Monday and asked the judge to delay Trump's sentencing while he weighs the high court's decision and how it could influence the New York case. The Associated Press obtained the letter Monday night. The lawyers argue that the Supreme Court's decision confirmed a defense position that prosecutors should have been precluded from introducing some evidence they said constituted official presidential acts.\n\nHighlights from Supreme Court term: Rulings on Trump, regulation, abortion, guns and homelessness\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ended its term by ruling for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, a decision that almost certainly means Donald Trump won't stand trial before the November election. That closely watched ruling was far from the only opinion handed down in the court's busy final few weeks, though. The court also dealt this session with cases involving gun control, regulatory powers, abortion, social media, homelessness and the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHurricane Beryl grows to Category 5 strength as it razes southeast Caribbean islands\n\nBRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) -- Hurricane Beryl has strengthened to Category 5 status as it crosses islands in the southeastern Caribbean. Beryl ripped off doors, windows and roofs in homes across the southeastern Caribbean on Monday. It had been the earliest Category 4 storm in the Atlantic, fueled by its record warm waters. Grenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said late Monday that one person had died and authorities had not been able to assess the situation on some hard-hit islands. Late Monday, Beryl's winds increased to 160 mph. Fluctuations in strength were likely in the coming days. Beryl was moving west-northwest. It was forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael orders Palestinians to flee Khan Younis, signaling likely new assault on southern Gaza city\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Israeli army has ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians from much of Gaza's second-largest city, Khan Younis. Monday's order is a sign that Israeli troops could soon return to the southern city. It's also an indication that Hamas has regrouped there. Israel wrapped up an offensive in Khan Younis earlier this year and withdrew most of its forces. Israel has said it is in the final stages of an offensive in the nearby Gaza city of Rafah. The new evacuation zone includes the major aid crossing to southern Gaza, along with an aid route inside the territory that Israel has said it would safeguard.\n\nIranian presidential candidates accuse each other of having no plan or experience ahead of runoff\n\nTEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's two presidential candidates are accusing each other of having no solution for the country's problems ahead of Friday's runoff. The election is aimed at choosing a successor for the late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died last month in a helicopter crash. During a more than two-hour debate on public TV, reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian attacked his competitor, Saeed Jalili, a hard-line former nuclear negotiator, for his lack of experience. Jalili, who is known as the \"Living Martyr\" after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, defended himself highlighting his career and positions held, including that of top nuclear negotiator. The candidates will have their second and last debate Tuesday.\n\nHaiti's gang violence has displaced 300,000 children, the UN says\n\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.N. says criminal gang violence in Haiti has displaced more than 300,000 children since March. UNICEF said Tuesday that children are more than half of the nearly 580,000 people that have been internally displaced so far in the last four months. The spike in violence by armed gangs began in late February after a series of coordinated attacks that led Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign. Criminal gangs control 80% of the capital and the key roads leading in and out of it. Many children are living in makeshift shelters and schools are in poor condition. The agency said children lacking access to food, health and hygiene may be forced to join the gangs to survive.\n\nAhead of election, Venezuela's Maduro says he has agreed to resume negotiations with United States\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Nicolás Maduro says Venezuela's government plans to resume negotiations with the U.S. government this week. His announcement Monday comes less than a month before a highly anticipated election in which he is seeking a third term. Maduro wants the U.S. to lift crippling economic sanctions and characterized the dialogue as \"urgent.\" It was not immediately clear whether the U.S. government has agreed. The July 28 election is shaping up to be the biggest challenge the ruling party has faced in its 25 years of dominance.\n\nTrump says he can end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day. Russia's UN ambassador says he can't\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Donald Trump has said repeatedly he can settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. When asked Monday to respond to the claim from the presumptive Republican nominee, Russia's United Nations Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters \"the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\" Trump has repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail that he wanted Russians and Ukrainians to stop dying and that he would \"have that done in 24 hours.\" Nebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 but the West blocked it.\n\nUS eliminated from Copa America with 1-0 loss to Uruguay, increasing pressure to fire Berhalter\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The United States was eliminated from the Copa America with a 1-0 loss to Uruguay on a questionable second-half goal by Mathías Olivera, a defeat that will increase pressure on the U.S. Soccer Federation to remove coach Gregg Berhalter before the 2026 World Cup. Uruguay scored when Nicolas De La Cruz swung a free kick in front of the U.S. goal. Matt Turner parried a header by Ronald Araújo, who outjumped defender Tim Ream, but the rebound went right to Mathias Olivera and he tapped the ball in with his left foot. Olivera appeared to be offside on the initial header.",

Grenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said late Monday that one person had died and authorities had not been able to assess the situation on some hard-hit islands. Late Monday, Beryl's winds increased to 160 mph. Fluctuations in strength were likely in the coming days. Beryl was moving west-northwest. It was forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael orders Palestinians to flee Khan Younis, signaling likely new assault on southern Gaza city\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Israeli army has ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians from much of Gaza's second-largest city, Khan Younis. Monday's order is a sign that Israeli troops could soon return to the southern city. It's also an indication that Hamas has regrouped there. Israel wrapped up an offensive in Khan Younis earlier this year and withdrew most of its forces. Israel has said it is in the final stages of an offensive in the nearby Gaza city of Rafah. The new evacuation zone includes the major aid crossing to southern Gaza, along with an aid route inside the territory that Israel has said it would safeguard.\n\nHaiti's gang violence has displaced 300,000 children, the UN says\n\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.N. says criminal gang violence in Haiti has displaced more than 300,000 children since March. UNICEF said Tuesday that children are more than half of the nearly 580,000 people that have been internally displaced so far in the last four months. The spike in violence by armed gangs began in late February after a series of coordinated attacks that led Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign. Criminal gangs control 80% of the capital and the key roads leading in and out of it. Many children are living in makeshift shelters and schools are in poor condition. The agency said children lacking access to food, health and hygiene may be forced to join the gangs to survive.\n\nAhead of election, Venezuela's Maduro says he has agreed to resume negotiations with United States\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Nicolás Maduro says Venezuela's government plans to resume negotiations with the U.S. government this week. His announcement Monday comes less than a month before a highly anticipated election in which he is seeking a third term. Maduro wants the U.S. to lift crippling economic sanctions and characterized the dialogue as \"urgent.\" It was not immediately clear whether the U.S. government has agreed. The July 28 election is shaping up to be the biggest challenge the ruling party has faced in its 25 years of dominance.\n\nAt 28, Bardella could become youngest French prime minister at helm of far-right National Rally\n\nNICE, France (AP) -- At just 28 years old, Jordan Bardella has helped make the far-right National Rally the strongest political force in France. And now he could become the country's youngest prime minister. Voters propelled Marine Le Pen's National Rally to a strong lead in the first round of snap legislative elections on Sunday. And now Bardella is rallying supporters to hand their party an absolute majority in the decisive round of voting on July 7. That would allow the anti-immigration, nationalist party to run the government, with Bardella at the helm.\n\nTrump says he can end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day. Russia's UN ambassador says he can't\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Donald Trump has said repeatedly he can settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. When asked Monday to respond to the claim from the presumptive Republican nominee, Russia's United Nations Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters \"the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\" Trump has repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail that he wanted Russians and Ukrainians to stop dying and that he would \"have that done in 24 hours.\" Nebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 but the West blocked it.\n\nUS eliminated from Copa America with 1-0 loss to Uruguay, increasing pressure to fire Berhalter\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The United States was eliminated from the Copa America with a 1-0 loss to Uruguay on a questionable second-half goal by Mathías Olivera, a defeat that will increase pressure on the U.S. Soccer Federation to remove coach Gregg Berhalter before the 2026 World Cup. Uruguay scored when Nicolas De La Cruz swung a free kick in front of the U.S. goal. Matt Turner parried a header by Ronald Araújo, who outjumped defender Tim Ream, but the rebound went right to Mathias Olivera and he tapped the ball in with his left foot. Olivera appeared to be offside on the initial header.\n\nMore from this section\n\nMAGLITE, The Pedestrian Safety Institute, Additional Partners to Promote Traffic and Pedestrian Safety During 2024 National Roadside Traffic Safety Awareness Month\n\nDown Payment Resource expands team to keep pace with a rising number of DPA programs and increasing demand\n\nSimone Biles headlines a U.S. women's gymnastics team eyeing redemption at the Paris Olympics",

        "body": "After Supreme Court immunity ruling, Biden draws sharp contrast with Trump on obeying rule of law\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden warned Monday that a Supreme Court ruling granting presidents broad immunity from prosecution would make an unchecked Republican Donald Trump \"more emboldened to do whatever he wants\" if he regains the White House in November's election.\n\nBiden, under intense pressure after his disastrous debate performance against Trump last week, urged Americans to think carefully about their election decision and signaled he had no intention of dropping out of the race.\n\nCriticizing the decision by the court's conservative majority -- which all but guarantees Trump will not face trial in Washington ahead of the November election over his actions during the violent riot on Jan. 6, 2021 -- Biden said it now fell to the American people \"to do what the courts should have been willing to do but will not.\n\n\"The American people have to render judgment about Donald Trump's behavior.\"\n\nBiden's efforts to reset his campaign following the debate, which spooked donors and stirred up major Democratic anxiety, has been looking a lot like his past attempts to keep the focus squarely on Trump's misdeeds and shortcomings. During his brief remarks Monday, he made no mention of last week's debate or his performance, and did not take questions, delivering an unusually political message from the White House.\n\nTrump seeks to set aside New York hush money verdict hours after Supreme Court ruling\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's lawyers on Monday asked the New York judge who presided over his hush money trial to set aside his conviction and delay his sentencing, scheduled for next week.\n\nThe letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan cited the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling earlier Monday and asked the judge to delay Trump's sentencing while he weighs the high court's decision and how it could influence the New York case, according to the letter obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe lawyers argue that the Supreme Court's decision confirmed a position the defense raised earlier in the case that prosecutors should have been precluded from introducing some evidence they said constituted official presidential acts, according to the letter.\n\nIn prior court filings, Trump contended he is immune from prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office. His lawyers did not raise that as a defense in the hush money case, but they argued that some evidence -- including Trump's social media posts about former lawyer Michael Cohen -- comes from his time as president and should have been excluded from the trial because of immunity protections.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office declined comment Monday night.\n\nHighlights from Supreme Court term: Rulings on Trump, regulation, abortion, guns and homelessness\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ended its term by ruling for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, a decision that almost certainly means Donald Trump won't stand trial before the November election. That closely watched ruling, which drew sharp dissent from the minority justices, was among a cluster of consequential opinions handed down in the court's busy final few weeks.\n\nHere's a look at the major cases the court decided this year.\n\nRuled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution in a decision that extends the delay in Donald Trump's trial in Washington on charges of election interference and all but rules out a trial before the November election. The justices returned the case to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who would preside over a trial. She must now sort out what is left of special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of the former president.\n\nMajority: Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito, Justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Justice Amy Coney Barrett\n\nDissent: Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Elena Kagan, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nHurricane Beryl grows to Category 5 strength as it razes southeast Caribbean islands\n\nBRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) -- Hurricane Beryl strengthened to Category 5 status late Monday after it ripped doors, windows and roofs off homes across the southeastern Caribbean with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nBeryl made landfall on the island of Carriacou in Grenada as the earliest Category 4 storm in the Atlantic, then late in the day the National Hurricane Center in Miami said its winds had increased to 160 mph (260 kph). Fluctuations in strength were likely in the coming days as the storm pushed further into the Caribbean.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said one person had died and he could not yet say if there were other fatalities because authorities had not been able to assess the situation on the islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique, where there were initial reports of major damage but communications were largely down.\n\n\"We do hope there aren't any other fatalities or any injuries,\" he said. \"But bear in mind the challenge we have in Carriacou and Petite Martinique.\" Mitchel added that the government will send people first thing Tuesday morning to evaluate the situation on the islands.\n\nStreets from St. Lucia island south to Grenada were strewn with shoes, trees, downed power lines and other debris. Banana trees were snapped in half and cows lay dead in green pastures with homes made of tin and plywood tilting precariously nearby.\n\nIsrael orders Palestinians to flee Khan Younis, signaling likely new assault on southern Gaza city\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Israeli army ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians from much of Khan Younis on Monday, a sign that troops are likely to launch a new ground assault into the Gaza Strip's second-largest city.\n\nThe order suggests Khan Younis will be the latest target of Israel's raids into parts of Gaza it had previously invaded in the war, as it pursues regrouping Hamas militants. Much of Khan Younis was destroyed in a long assault earlier this year, but large numbers of Palestinians had moved back to escape another Israeli offensive in Gaza's southernmost city, Rafah.\n\nThe evacuation came as Israel released the director of what was once Gaza's largest hospital after holding him for seven months without charge or trial. Israel alleged the hospital had been used as a Hamas command center, which he and other Palestinian health officials have denied. The doctor said he and other detainees were held under harsh conditions and tortured.\n\nThe decision to release Mohammed Abu Selmia raised questions over Israel's claims surrounding Shifa Hospital, which Israeli forces have raided twice since the start of the war with Hamas. The hospital was left severely damaged after the raids.\n\nAbu Selmia's release triggered an uproar across Israel's political spectrum. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office called it \"a grave mistake.\" Government ministers and opposition leaders expressed outrage and insisted Abu Selmia played a role in Hamas' alleged use of the hospital -- although Israeli security services rarely unilaterally free prisoners if they have a suspicion of militant links.\n\nFlorida prosecutors knew Epstein raped teenage girls 2 years before cutting deal, transcript shows\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida prosecutors knew the late millionaire and financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually assaulted teenage girls two years before they cut a plea deal that has long been criticized as too lenient and a missed opportunity to imprison him a decade earlier, according to transcripts released Monday.\n\nThe 2006 grand jury investigation was the first of many by law enforcement over the past two decades into Epstein's rape and sex trafficking of teenagers -- and how his ties to the rich and the powerful seem to have allowed him to avoid prison or a serious jail term for over a decade.\n\nThe investigations uncovered Epstein's close ties to former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew, as well as his once friendly relationship with former President Donald Trump and numerous others of wealth and influence who have denied doing anything criminal or improper and not been charged.\n\nCircuit Judge Luis Delgado's release of approximately 150 pages Monday came as a surprise, since there was scheduled hearing next week over unsealing the graphic testimony. Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed a bill in February allowing the release on Monday or any time thereafter that Delgado ordered. Florida grand jury transcripts are usually kept secret forever, but the bill created an exemption for cases like Epstein's.\n\nThe transcripts show that the grand jury heard testimony that Epstein, who was then in his 40s, had raped teenage girls as young as 14 at his Palm Beach mansion, often paying them so he could commit statutory rape or assault. The teenagers testified and told detectives they were also paid cash or rented cars if they found him more girls.\n\nAhead of election, Venezuela's Maduro says he has agreed to resume negotiations with United States\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's government plans to resume negotiations with the U.S. government this week, President Nicolás Maduro announced Monday, less than a month before a highly anticipated election in which he and his party are facing their toughest challenge in decades.\n\nMaduro, who is seeking a third term, wants the U.S. government to lift crippling economic sanctions that were imposed over the last decade in an effort to topple him. He characterized the dialogue as \"urgent\" during his weekly TV show.\n\nThe Biden administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\n\"I have received the proposal during two continuous months from the United States government to reestablish talks and direct dialogue,\" Maduro said. \"After thinking about it for two months, I have accepted, and next Wednesday, talks will restart with the United States government to comply with the agreements signed in Qatar and to reestablish the terms of the urgent dialogue.\"\n\nMaduro's government had held parallel talks with the Biden administration and with the U.S.-backed Unitary Platform opposition coalition. But they were suspended as he reneged on promises, including to improve conditions ahead of the election, and his government accused the U.S. of not fulfilling portions of agreements.\n\nAt 28, Bardella could become youngest French prime minister at helm of far-right National Rally\n\nNICE, France (AP) -- At just 28 years old, Jordan Bardella has helped make the far-right National Rally the strongest political force in France. And now he could become the country's youngest prime minister.\n\nAfter voters propelled Marine Le Pen's National Rally to a strong lead in Sunday's first round of snap legislative elections, Bardella turned to rallying supporters to hand their party an absolute majority in the decisive round on July 7. That would allow the anti-immigration, nationalist party to run the government, with Bardella at the helm.\n\nWhen Bardella replaced his mentor, Marine Le Pen, in 2022 at the helm of France's leading far-right party, he became the first person without the Le Pen name to lead it since its founding a half-century ago.\n\nHis selection marked a symbolic changing of the guard. It was part of Le Pen's decade-long effort to rebrand her party, with its history of racism, and remove the stigma of antisemitism that clung to it in order to broaden its base. She has notably distanced herself from her now-ostracized father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who co-founded the party, then called the National Front, and who has been repeatedly convicted of hate speech.\n\nBardella is part of a generation of young people who joined the party under Marine Le Pen in the 2010s but likely wouldn't have done so under her father.\n\nTrump says he can end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day. Russia's UN ambassador says he can't\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Donald Trump has said repeatedly he could settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. Russia's United Nations ambassador says he can't.\n\nWhen asked to respond to the claim from the presumptive Republican nominee, Vassily Nebenzia told reporters Monday that \"the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\"\n\nAt a CNN town hall in May 2023, Trump said: \"They're dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I'll have that done -- I'll have that done in 24 hours.\" He said that would happen after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. And he keeps repeating the claim on the campaign trail.\n\nDuring last week's debate with President Joe Biden, Trump claimed, \"If we had a real president, a president that knew -- that was respected by Putin ... he would have never invaded Ukraine.\"\n\nNebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 in Istanbul when Russia and Ukraine were \"very close\" to an agreement. Moscow invaded its neighbor two months earlier on Feb. 24, 2022, though Russia insists its \"special military operation\" began in 2014 after clashes in Ukraine's east resulted in Moscow seizing the Crimea Peninsula.\n\nUS eliminated from Copa America with 1-0 loss to Uruguay, increasing pressure to fire Berhalter\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The United States was eliminated from the Copa America with a 1-0 loss to Uruguay on Mathías Olivera's questionable second-half goal Monday night, a defeat sure to increase pressure on the U.S. Soccer Federation to remove coach Gregg Berhalter before the 2026 World Cup.\n\nUruguay scored in the 66th minute when Nicolas De La Cruz swung a free kick in front of the U.S. goal. Matt Turner parried a header by Ronald Araújo, who out-jumped defender Tim Ream, but the rebound went right to Mathias Olivera and he tapped the ball in with his left foot.\n\nOlivera appeared to be offside on the initial header but the goal stood after a video review.\n\nUsing a lineup of players entirely from European clubs, Berhalter and the U.S. hoped to show the team had advanced since its round-of-16 elimination against the Netherlands at the 2022 World Cup. Instead, the U.S. managed only a 2-0 win over lowly Bolivia and were upset 2-1 by Panama, putting it in a tough situation Monday night.\n\n\"We had a good start and brought a lot of energy but at the end of the day, just not enough quality,\" U.S. captain Christian Pulisic said. \"I felt like we gave it everything but we just couldn't score.\"",

A circuit judge's release Monday afternoon of the approximately 150 pages came as a surprise as there's a scheduled hearing for next week on when and how to release them. Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed a bill in February allowing their release on Monday or any time thereafter that the judge ordered. One girl testified that she was paid $300 to give Epstein a sexual massage and $200 every time she recruited a friend.\n\nAhead of election, Venezuela's Maduro says he has agreed to resume negotiations with United States\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Nicolás Maduro says Venezuela's government plans to resume negotiations with the U.S. government this week. His announcement Monday comes less than a month before a highly anticipated election in which he is seeking a third term. Maduro wants the U.S. to lift crippling economic sanctions and characterized the dialogue as \"urgent.\" It was not immediately clear whether the U.S. government has agreed. The July 28 election is shaping up to be the biggest challenge the ruling party has faced in its 25 years of dominance.\n\nAt 28, Bardella could become youngest French prime minister at helm of far-right National Rally\n\nNICE, France (AP) -- At just 28 years old, Jordan Bardella has helped make the far-right National Rally the strongest political force in France. And now he could become the country's youngest prime minister. Voters propelled Marine Le Pen's National Rally to a strong lead in the first round of snap legislative elections on Sunday. And now Bardella is rallying supporters to hand their party an absolute majority in the decisive round of voting on July 7. That would allow the anti-immigration, nationalist party to run the government, with Bardella at the helm.\n\nTrump says he can end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day. Russia's UN ambassador says he can't\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Donald Trump has said repeatedly he can settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. When asked Monday to respond to the claim from the presumptive Republican nominee, Russia's United Nations Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters \"the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\" Trump has repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail that he wanted Russians and Ukrainians to stop dying and that he would \"have that done in 24 hours.\" Nebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 but the West blocked it.\n\nUS eliminated from Copa America with 1-0 loss to Uruguay, increasing pressure to fire Berhalter\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The United States was eliminated from the Copa America with a 1-0 loss to Uruguay on a questionable second-half goal by Mathías Olivera, a defeat that will increase pressure on the U.S. Soccer Federation to remove coach Gregg Berhalter before the 2026 World Cup. Uruguay scored when Nicolas De La Cruz swung a free kick in front of the U.S. goal. Matt Turner parried a header by Ronald Araújo, who outjumped defender Tim Ream, but the rebound went right to Mathias Olivera and he tapped the ball in with his left foot. Olivera appeared to be offside on the initial header.",

During his brief remarks Monday, he made no mention of last week's debate or his performance, and did not take questions, delivering an unusually political message from the White House.\n\nTrump seeks to set aside New York hush money verdict hours after Supreme Court ruling\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's lawyers on Monday asked the New York judge who presided over his hush money trial to set aside his conviction and delay his sentencing, scheduled for next week.\n\nThe letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan cited the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling earlier Monday and asked the judge to delay Trump's sentencing while he weighs the high court's decision and how it could influence the New York case, according to the letter obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe lawyers argue that the Supreme Court's decision confirmed a position the defense raised earlier in the case that prosecutors should have been precluded from introducing some evidence they said constituted official presidential acts, according to the letter.\n\nIn prior court filings, Trump contended he is immune from prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office. His lawyers did not raise that as a defense in the hush money case, but they argued that some evidence -- including Trump's social media posts about former lawyer Michael Cohen -- comes from his time as president and should have been excluded from the trial because of immunity protections.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office declined comment Monday night.\n\nHighlights from Supreme Court term: Rulings on Trump, regulation, abortion, guns and homelessness\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ended its term by ruling for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, a decision that almost certainly means Donald Trump won't stand trial before the November election. That closely watched ruling, which drew sharp dissent from the minority justices, was among a cluster of consequential opinions handed down in the court's busy final few weeks.\n\nHere's a look at the major cases the court decided this year.\n\nRuled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution in a decision that extends the delay in Donald Trump's trial in Washington on charges of election interference and all but rules out a trial before the November election. The justices returned the case to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who would preside over a trial. She must now sort out what is left of special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of the former president.\n\nMajority: Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito, Justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Justice Amy Coney Barrett\n\nDissent: Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Elena Kagan, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nHurricane Beryl grows to Category 5 strength as it razes southeast Caribbean islands\n\nBRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) -- Hurricane Beryl strengthened to Category 5 status late Monday after it ripped doors, windows and roofs off homes across the southeastern Caribbean with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nBeryl made landfall on the island of Carriacou in Grenada as the earliest Category 4 storm in the Atlantic, then late in the day the National Hurricane Center in Miami said its winds had increased to 160 mph (260 kph). Fluctuations in strength were likely in the coming days as the storm pushed further into the Caribbean.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said one person had died and he could not yet say if there were other fatalities because authorities had not been able to assess the situation on the islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique, where there were initial reports of major damage but communications were largely down.\n\n\"We do hope there aren't any other fatalities or any injuries,\" he said. \"But bear in mind the challenge we have in Carriacou and Petite Martinique.\" Mitchel added that the government will send people first thing Tuesday morning to evaluate the situation on the islands.\n\nStreets from St. Lucia island south to Grenada were strewn with shoes, trees, downed power lines and other debris. Banana trees were snapped in half and cows lay dead in green pastures with homes made of tin and plywood tilting precariously nearby.\n\nIsrael orders Palestinians to flee Khan Younis, signaling likely new assault on southern Gaza city\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Israeli army ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians from much of Khan Younis on Monday, a sign that troops are likely to launch a new ground assault into the Gaza Strip's second-largest city.\n\nThe order suggests Khan Younis will be the latest target of Israel's raids into parts of Gaza it had previously invaded in the war, as it pursues regrouping Hamas militants. Much of Khan Younis was destroyed in a long assault earlier this year, but large numbers of Palestinians had moved back to escape another Israeli offensive in Gaza's southernmost city, Rafah.\n\nThe evacuation came as Israel released the director of what was once Gaza's largest hospital after holding him for seven months without charge or trial. Israel alleged the hospital had been used as a Hamas command center, which he and other Palestinian health officials have denied. The doctor said he and other detainees were held under harsh conditions and tortured.\n\nThe decision to release Mohammed Abu Selmia raised questions over Israel's claims surrounding Shifa Hospital, which Israeli forces have raided twice since the start of the war with Hamas. The hospital was left severely damaged after the raids.\n\nAbu Selmia's release triggered an uproar across Israel's political spectrum. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office called it \"a grave mistake.\" Government ministers and opposition leaders expressed outrage and insisted Abu Selmia played a role in Hamas' alleged use of the hospital -- although Israeli security services rarely unilaterally free prisoners if they have a suspicion of militant links.\n\nFlorida prosecutors knew Epstein raped teenage girls 2 years before cutting deal, transcript shows\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida prosecutors knew the late millionaire and financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually assaulted teenage girls two years before they cut a plea deal that has long been criticized as too lenient and a missed opportunity to imprison him a decade earlier, according to transcripts released Monday.\n\nThe 2006 grand jury investigation was the first of many by law enforcement over the past two decades into Epstein's rape and sex trafficking of teenagers -- and how his ties to the rich and the powerful seem to have allowed him to avoid prison or a serious jail term for over a decade.\n\nThe investigations uncovered Epstein's close ties to former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew, as well as his once friendly relationship with former President Donald Trump and numerous others of wealth and influence who have denied doing anything criminal or improper and not been charged.\n\nCircuit Judge Luis Delgado's release of approximately 150 pages Monday came as a surprise, since there was scheduled hearing next week over unsealing the graphic testimony. Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed a bill in February allowing the release on Monday or any time thereafter that Delgado ordered. Florida grand jury transcripts are usually kept secret forever, but the bill created an exemption for cases like Epstein's.\n\nThe transcripts show that the grand jury heard testimony that Epstein, who was then in his 40s, had raped teenage girls as young as 14 at his Palm Beach mansion, often paying them so he could commit statutory rape or assault. The teenagers testified and told detectives they were also paid cash or rented cars if they found him more girls.\n\nAhead of election, Venezuela's Maduro says he has agreed to resume negotiations with United States\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's government plans to resume negotiations with the U.S. government this week, President Nicolás Maduro announced Monday, less than a month before a highly anticipated election in which he and his party are facing their toughest challenge in decades.\n\nMaduro, who is seeking a third term, wants the U.S. government to lift crippling economic sanctions that were imposed over the last decade in an effort to topple him. He characterized the dialogue as \"urgent\" during his weekly TV show.\n\nThe Biden administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\n\"I have received the proposal during two continuous months from the United States government to reestablish talks and direct dialogue,\" Maduro said. \"After thinking about it for two months, I have accepted, and next Wednesday, talks will restart with the United States government to comply with the agreements signed in Qatar and to reestablish the terms of the urgent dialogue.\"\n\nMaduro's government had held parallel talks with the Biden administration and with the U.S.-backed Unitary Platform opposition coalition. But they were suspended as he reneged on promises, including to improve conditions ahead of the election, and his government accused the U.S. of not fulfilling portions of agreements.\n\nAt 28, Bardella could become youngest French prime minister at helm of far-right National Rally\n\nNICE, France (AP) -- At just 28 years old, Jordan Bardella has helped make the far-right National Rally the strongest political force in France. And now he could become the country's youngest prime minister.\n\nAfter voters propelled Marine Le Pen's National Rally to a strong lead in Sunday's first round of snap legislative elections, Bardella turned to rallying supporters to hand their party an absolute majority in the decisive round on July 7. That would allow the anti-immigration, nationalist party to run the government, with Bardella at the helm.\n\nWhen Bardella replaced his mentor, Marine Le Pen, in 2022 at the helm of France's leading far-right party, he became the first person without the Le Pen name to lead it since its founding a half-century ago.\n\nHis selection marked a symbolic changing of the guard. It was part of Le Pen's decade-long effort to rebrand her party, with its history of racism, and remove the stigma of antisemitism that clung to it in order to broaden its base. She has notably distanced herself from her now-ostracized father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who co-founded the party, then called the National Front, and who has been repeatedly convicted of hate speech.\n\nBardella is part of a generation of young people who joined the party under Marine Le Pen in the 2010s but likely wouldn't have done so under her father.\n\nTrump says he can end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day. Russia's UN ambassador says he can't\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Donald Trump has said repeatedly he could settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. Russia's United Nations ambassador says he can't.\n\nWhen asked to respond to the claim from the presumptive Republican nominee, Vassily Nebenzia told reporters Monday that \"the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\"\n\nAt a CNN town hall in May 2023, Trump said: \"They're dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I'll have that done -- I'll have that done in 24 hours.\" He said that would happen after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. And he keeps repeating the claim on the campaign trail.\n\nDuring last week's debate with President Joe Biden, Trump claimed, \"If we had a real president, a president that knew -- that was respected by Putin ... he would have never invaded Ukraine.\"\n\nNebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 in Istanbul when Russia and Ukraine were \"very close\" to an agreement. Moscow invaded its neighbor two months earlier on Feb. 24, 2022, though Russia insists its \"special military operation\" began in 2014 after clashes in Ukraine's east resulted in Moscow seizing the Crimea Peninsula.\n\nUS eliminated from Copa America with 1-0 loss to Uruguay, increasing pressure to fire Berhalter\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The United States was eliminated from the Copa America with a 1-0 loss to Uruguay on Mathías Olivera's questionable second-half goal Monday night, a defeat sure to increase pressure on the U.S. Soccer Federation to remove coach Gregg Berhalter before the 2026 World Cup.\n\nUruguay scored in the 66th minute when Nicolas De La Cruz swung a free kick in front of the U.S. goal. Matt Turner parried a header by Ronald Araújo, who out-jumped defender Tim Ream, but the rebound went right to Mathias Olivera and he tapped the ball in with his left foot.\n\nOlivera appeared to be offside on the initial header but the goal stood after a video review.\n\nUsing a lineup of players entirely from European clubs, Berhalter and the U.S. hoped to show the team had advanced since its round-of-16 elimination against the Netherlands at the 2022 World Cup. Instead, the U.S. managed only a 2-0 win over lowly Bolivia and were upset 2-1 by Panama, putting it in a tough situation Monday night.\n\n\"We had a good start and brought a lot of energy but at the end of the day, just not enough quality,\" U.S. captain Christian Pulisic said. \"I felt like we gave it everything but we just couldn't score.\"",

        "body": "Those Americans who might hope that the growing public opposition to continuing U.S. aid to Ukraine might signal a wave of fresh thinking about foreign policy in the Republican party are likely to be disappointed. Most members of the establishment cling to the idea that the principal worry about Republican policy views is the growing appeal of \"isolationism.\" A recent example was a Washington Post column by Marc A. Thiessen. Thiessen was responding to a speech by President Biden at the Normandy battlefield, and the exchange illustrated the utter sterility in America's current foreign policy debate.\n\nThiessen is annoyed because Biden had accused GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump of isolationism. Instead of pointing out that isolationism has long been a vacuous epithet used to discredit critics who want to move beyond the policies created during the Cold War, Thiessen's goal is quite different. It is to make the case that Trump is part of the Republican hawkish establishment: \"Biden's latest attack on Trump is wildly inaccurate.\" The essence of Thiessen's defense is that Trump is at least as hawkish as his more conventional Republican colleagues. He asserts, in essence, that \"Trump is as hawkish as we are.\" Thiessen heaps praise on the former president for Trump's hardline policies against Iran, including the assassination of General Quasem Soleimani.\n\nThiessen also points out that contrary to the mythology fostered by the Democrats that Trump was Vladimir Putin's puppet, Trump had launched cyber attacks against Russia and, unlike the Obama administration, had provided weapons to Ukraine. Echoing allegations by Mitch McConnell and other GOP congressional leaders, Thiessen contends that there are indeed isolationists in the Republican Party, most notably Senator J.D. Vance (R-Ohio). But, according to Thiessen, \"Trump's record suggests he is not the isolationist they hope him to be.\"\n\nLeaving aside Thiessen's silly isolationist epithet, he's likely correct that the foreign policy of a new Trump administration would differ little from the collection of obsolete assumptions and counterproductive policies that have plagued U.S. foreign policy for decades. For real, beneficial change in U.S. foreign policy, a new administration would need to recognize the actual conditions of the world in the 21 century and make necessary policy adjustments.\n\nThe Biden administration clearly is incapable of doing that. Its policies, both in the Middle East and in Europe, have been disastrous. Entangling the United States in the Russia-Ukraine war and serving as Israel's enabler for its brutal actions in Gaza are not effective or beneficial strategies for the American people.\n\nTo actually implement the strategy of \"Peace through Strength\" that Thiessen and so many other Republicans advocate requires fresh thinking on multiple fronts. It certainly requires going beyond the interventionist cliches that Thiessen and his colleagues embrace. Among other changes, it would require Washington to accept the reality that spheres of influence exist and will continue to exist in world affairs. Launching emotional crusades against Russia, Iran, and other major powers is precisely the dangerous, unrewarding approach that the U.S. must avoid. No longer confining America's foreign policy options to the kind of thinking embraced by Mark Thiessen or Joe Biden is an essential first step.\n\nThe sterility of the Biden faction's ideas is evident in multiple cases. Contrary to the expectations of many U.S. foreign policy experts, the Biden administration's policy toward the People's Republic of China (PRC) has been far more confrontational than anticipated. In fact, there is little difference in Washington's actions on either economic or strategic issues regarding China between the Trump and Biden years. In particular, Biden has continued Trump's buildup of U.S. security support for Taiwan. Moreover, the Biden administration has actually taken a harder line toward North Korea than Trump had adopted.\n\nThe United States is now in the ill-advised position of being on bad terms simultaneously with Moscow and Beijing. If productive policy change is to come, it will not likely take place with either Joe Biden or Donald Trump in the White House.",

        "summary": "The article critiques the current state of U.S. foreign policy, particularly within the Republican Party, highlighting a lack of fresh thinking and the persistence of outdated, interventionist approaches. Marc A. Thiessen's Washington Post column defends Donald Trump against accusations of isolationism, arguing that Trump is as hawkish as traditional Republicans, citing his hardline policies against Iran and Russia. The article suggests that both the Biden and Trump administrations have failed to adapt to 21st-century global realities, continuing counterproductive policies. It criticizes Biden's confrontational stance towards China and North Korea and his involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war and support for Israel's actions in Gaza. The piece calls for a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, moving away from emotional crusades and recognizing the existence of spheres of influence in global affairs."

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Clinches a $4.5B Contract for PAC-3 MSE Missiles",
        "body": "Per major news sources, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently secured a multi-year contract worth $4.5 billion for its Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target Advanced Capability-3 missile from the U.S. Army. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will procure 870 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (\"MSE\") missiles and associated hardware.\n\nGlobal geopolitical and socioeconomic unrest has led both developed and emerging nations to increase the size of their armaments, with missiles making up a large share of these arsenals. Consequently, leading missile manufacturers such as Lockheed are witnessing a solid contract flow for their combat-proven missiles and associated hardware. The latest contract win is evidence of it.\n\nSpecifically, Lockheed's Missiles and Fire Control division develops cutting-edge combat missiles for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and several international allies of the United States. LMT's PAC-3 is a missile that is highly sophisticated and can protect against advanced threats, such as airplanes, cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles and tactical ballistic missiles.\n\nIn light of this, it is essential to note that 15 partner nations of the United States are currently using the PAC-3 family of missiles, with Lockheed having manufactured 17,000 PAC-3 MSEs so far. This undoubtedly illustrates the strong demand PAC-3 enjoys in the global missile industry.\n\nWith the ongoing hostilities in various regions of the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war, which has been going on for more than two years, the global peace index indicates an unstable environment. As a result, the demand for military weapons -- especially missiles -- has increased in the defense industry as countries attempt to defend their borders from previously unheard-of attacks.\n\nConsequently, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the global missiles and missiles defense system market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period. Such growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market should bode well for Lockheed, which is a prominent missile manufacturer.\n\nA PAC-3 MSE interceptor was launched by Lockheed in May 2024 from an MK-70 containerized launch vehicle to intercept a cruise missile target in flight, a notable move to expand the PAC-3 missile's market reach. With the help of the Virtualized Aegis Weapon System, PAC-3 MSE was deployed in this configuration for the first time to intercept a live target. It is anticipated that these modernization initiatives, along with the rising demand for missiles, will result in further PAC-3 missile contract wins, which will improve LMT's top line.\n\nAs global threats continue to rise, apart from LMT, defense contractors that are likely to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the missiles and missile defense system market are as follows:\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It creates and manufactures warheads, fuses, sophisticated high-speed propulsion systems and other missile components. The company is one of the top suppliers of solid rocket propulsion for air-launched missiles, interceptors, submarine-launched weapons and hypersonic missile systems.\n\nNorthrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC's 2024 sales suggests growth of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nRTX Corp RTX: It offers a variety of combat-proven missile defense systems, including the Patriot missile, Standard Missiles, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, Evolved Seasparrow Missiles, the Tomahawk cruise missile and a few more. To keep up with its growing demand for a wide variety of missiles, RTX broke ground with a $115 million worth, 26,000-square-foot expansion of its Redstone Raytheon Missile Integration Facility in April 2024.\n\nRTX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales implies an improvement of 6.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nThe Boeing Company BA: For almost 25 years, Boeing has been providing the United States, its allies and international partners with air and missile defense systems. The Avenger Air Defense System, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense and a few additional missiles are among its product offerings.\n\nBA boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 25.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales suggests an improvement of 0.9% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nIn the past six months, shares of Lockheed have risen 3.1% against the industry's decline of 10.2%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLockheed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "NATO offers Ukraine a new HQ in Germany - a \"bridge\" to Kyiv's eventual membership   - NaturalNews.com",
        "body": "Officials from NATO and the U.S. confirmed the move, adding that the headquarters will be formally announced at the group's upcoming 75th anniversary summit, to be held in Washington, D.C. from July 9 to July 11. The mission will be known as the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) and will work to \"reduce duplications and complications from the various kinds of weaponry sent to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to DNYUZ, the NSATU will be based at a U.S. military facility in the city of Wiesbaden in Germany's Hesse state. It will be headed by a three-star general - likely an American - reporting to Gen. Christopher Cavoli, the head of the U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe.\n\nNSATU will bring under one umbrella the activities of the current \"capabilities coalition\" of countries that provide various aspects of military aid to Ukraine like air defenses, artillery, F-16 fighter jets, arms and training. The U.S. and NATO officials who spoke on condition of anonymity added that the NSATU will also coordinate the training of Ukrainian military personnel in allied countries and the longer-term bilateral security agreements that different countries have signed with Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO Ivo Daalder explained that putting the NSATU under Cavoli's NATO hat will protect it from any political change in Washington. Because the mission will be under NATO's auspices, it is designed to function even if former U.S. President Donald Trump wins the November presidential elections and returns to the White House.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

But U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that NATO's 75th anniversary summit would show that allies are taking \"concrete steps\" to bring Ukraine closer. He added that it would also ensure that Kyiv has a \"bridge to eventual membership.\"\n\nAccording to DNYUZ, the Biden administration and NATO officials came up with the idea as a way to give something solid to Kyiv at the summit - even as they maintain the time is not right for Ukraine to join. The hope is that the mission and the commitment it represents will satisfy Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and lead to a smoother summit. (Related: The outcome of Ukraine's war with Russia will determine whether it achieves NATO membership.)\n\nLast year, Zelensky and other Central European nations fervently hoped that NATO would offer Ukraine membership negotiations during the 2023 NATO summit held in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. But the alliance refused to offer Ukraine a fixed timeline and clear path to membership or to allow negotiations on membership to begin, driving Zelensky to voice out his displeasure.\n\nAll NATO member countries are on board the NSATU's establishment. However, according to Daalder, Germany objected to calling it a \"mission\" to avoid the implication that NATO was at war with Russia. While the group has yet to declare war with Moscow, its assistance of Ukraine makes it a party to the conflict.\n\nOutgoing NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg vaguely touched on the NSATU initiative at a June 14 news conference, which followed a meeting of NATO defense ministers on the same day. He called the new mission a \"key summit deliverable\" and a further step \"on Ukraine's path to NATO membership.\"\n\nStoltenberg reiterated that the initiative would \"put our support to Ukraine on a firmer footing for years to come.\" He added: \"These efforts do not make NATO a party to the conflict, but they will enhance our support to Ukraine to uphold its right to self-defense.\"\n\nBut ultimately, the NSATU will surely infuriate Russia and further derail potential peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has imposed two requirements before talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war could begin - Ukraine must pull out all its troops in territories annexed by Russia and must abandon its intent to join NATO.\n\nListen to the Health Ranger Mike Adams explaining that the U.S. and NATO have already decided to take the American people to war below.\n\nU.S., Ukraine sign 10-year bilateral security agreement backed by nothing.\n\nNATO to overstep Russia's red line as it mulls sending troops to train Ukrainian armed forces.",

        "title": "Doug Burgum Is a Neocon",
        "body": "The selection of the North Dakota governor would be a cavalier choice on the issue of greatest presidential power: foreign policy.\n\nIt's July. In the coming days, the Republican presidential ticket will finalize, even as the Democratic ticket could evaporate.\n\nThe former President Donald Trump is meditating on a raft of main choices -- among them Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and Senator J.D. Vance (R-OH). One contender of a previously lower profile, however, has evolved from dark horse to an apparent favorite in the sweepstakes. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum is seen by his adherents as a well-suited, no-nonsense deputy for the second Trump tour of duty.\n\nSquint and you can see the case: younger, but not too much younger (at 67, Burgum will not overshadow Trump with youthful panache). He has a business record (he sold a software company to Microsoft in the Clinton-era tech craze). A non-factor rival for the nomination last year, Burgum is said to get on with the presumptive Republican nominee. Burgum's wife is a recovering alcoholic -- a point of sympathy from the ex-president who blames his brother Fred's premature demise on the bottle.\n\nMany are hoping that a second Trump term would be a bespoke version of the first. Populists clamor for a more tough-minded focus on the issues -- foreign policy restraint, trade realism and migration sanity -- that helped make Trump the most powerful man in the world.\n\nThe selection of Burgum would indeed be vintage -- but not in an inspired way.\n\nFor instance, Burgum has stated the U.S. is literally \"at war\" with Russia and appeared to leave the door open to future deployment of American troops. In one video interview, Burgum stated, \"We're in a cold war with China, and we're actually at war with Russia-we just haven't sent troops yet. We're sending material, we're sending funding, we're sending advisors.\"\n\nIt's not just Eurasia that Burgum wants troops, but also that old standby: the Middle East. Burgum has been open to placing American troops in the maelstrom of the Israel-Gaza war. \"Absolutely,\" Burgum told voters in 2023.\n\nBurgum has said U.S. funding for the war in Ukraine, which now totals nearly $200 billion, is \"a bargain\" and was only \"a little bit\" of money -- he also rejected that the spending was \"irresponsible.\" Burgum also suggested Ukraine should not cede any territory to Russia in peace negotiations, comparing that possible outcome to the cessation of the Korean War.\n\n(In fairness, that is not the most irresponsible analogy. Indeed, Washington may eventually have to assent to an armistice that its disputatious and radicalized ally government, led by Volodoymr Zelsensky, absents itself from. This was the case in Korea, with Syngman Rhee, who was committed to the war to the last American. But back in reality, full territorial restoration of Ukraine is out of the question, and such a stance could make the war permanent.)\n\nWhile perhaps no John Bolton, Burgum is many ways more the archetype of the sort of regrettable selection at the commanding heights that Trump made in his first term. In other words, Burgum is Rex Tillerson, except that he ran North Dakota and a vassal company of Microsoft, and not the most powerful American oil company since the age of Rockefeller.\n\n(In a rather rib-tickling aside, Burgum has called Iran the \"parent company\" of Hamas, implying openness to a wider Middle East war. He appears to speak from some experience.)\n\nBurgum has expressed his support for further funding for Ukraine, echoing President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's talking points that an endless war is somehow connected to competition with China, and even North Korea for good measure. Burgum appears to fear an axis of evil, a grandiose and discredited view of the non-American world, though he won't call it that.\n\n\"I support us making sure that Putin does not get a win in Ukraine...if we don't defeat Putin it's just basically handing another win to China,\" Burgum has commented. \"You can't say 'Oh, China's our existential threat, but let's not send money to Russia,' Russia and China are absolutely connected and throw in North Korea, who's been meeting both with China and Russia....\"\n\nAt last Thursday's prize-winning debate against Biden, Trump told the nation he would broker the end of the Russia-Ukraine war as president-elect. It was a callback to the kind of fast action pledged by Ronald Reagan in 1980 during the Iran crisis, and Richard Nixon amid the Vietnam War.\n\nBurgum's record suggests he would be a hindrance to such an endeavor. Not in an overt way, a la Bolton. But in a way that is in some ways more familiar, and odious.\n\nBurgum's record is establishmentarian to the core on the issue of greatest presidential power: foreign policy. It's not clear that there is much daylight between Burgum and a figure such as Mike Pompeo, for instance, the former secretary of State who stumped for Trump rival Glenn Youngkin as he considered a presidential bid last year and a person the 45th president is said to have soured on.\n\nMost distressing: Burgum could help deprioritize the Trumpist signature issue of immigration as vice president, just as the public is coming around to realism on migration.\n\nBurgum also refused to prioritize border funding over Ukraine funding, rejecting demands of reformers in Congress. \"The idea that some people are saying: 'Oh, we shouldn't send money to Ukraine because we need to spend it on our own border.' Actually, America can do both of those things at the same time.... We can help Ukraine beat Russia and we can secure our own border at the same time,\" Burgum told Forbes in 2023.\n\nIt goes on.\n\nIn a town hall with New Hampshire voters, Burgum said he thought \"our obligations to Western Europe are significant,\" adding \"Ukraine is actually doing the work of NATO\" by fighting Russia. And Burgum's campaign website still lists two \"common enemies\" under the national security policy section, adding the U.S. should somehow unite against them: \"China and Putin.\"\n\nMany have long postulated Trump might attempt a \"reverse\" Nixon strategy -- get tough with China and get real with Russia. Burgum apparently thinks Trump should not even try.\n\nThere is a rich history on what actually constitutes a \"neocon.\" Some have argued that George W. Bush luminaries Bolton, Donald Rumsfeld, and Dick Cheney were not neoconservatives -- even in the arch-neocon administration. The argument is that they were conservative ultra-nationalists and militarists, in favor of manifold conflicts, but averse to nation-building. This tendency is contrasted with other Bushies like Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, and Doug Feith.\n\nAs the late historian Mark Perry observed in \"Talking To Terrorists\": \"Wolfowitz was completely different. He was haunted by the slaughter of the Shias in the aftermath of the first Gulf War as America sat on its hands. It kept him awake nights.\" But as Jacob Heilbrunn, editor of the National Interest, observed in his treatise They Knew They Were Right: The Rise of the Neocons, at a certain point you can slice and dice the matter to the point that there are no gentile neocons.\n\nWhile fun to riff on, it is a distinction without a difference.\n\nThe true rift in American national security debate is between cocksure primacy and chastened restraint. Either you believe the last quarter century of American foreign policy has been ruinous, or you seek to double down. Whatever his other virtues, Doug Burgum would be another neoconservative in power.",

        "body": "Summary and Key Points: The recent Bayou Warrior military exercise at Barksdale Air Force Base involved the deployment of live missiles by the U.S. Air Force's B-52H fleet.\n\n-This exercise reflects the increasing global military tensions reminiscent of pre-World War I maneuvers. The U.S. military, under financial and logistical strains, is training intensely to prepare for potential conflicts with near-peer adversaries like China and Russia.\n\n-Despite these efforts, significant concerns remain about the readiness and current doctrines of the U.S. military, suggesting a need for new strategic thinking and leadership to navigate the evolving geopolitical landscape.\n\nA recent military exercise at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana saw the base's B-52H fleet deploying \"live missiles\" in what the Air Force referred to as a \"readiness exercise\" dubbed Bayou Warrior.\n\nThe exercise was intended to be real-world training for a U.S. military that is increasingly under threat from multiple powers - some of them, such as China and Russia, that are considered to be nearly equal in capabilities to the United States.\n\nOn the eve of the First World War, the conflict that basically broke the 20th century and obliterated the centuries-long European-led world order, the great powers of that era jockeyed for power.\n\nAs part of these maneuvers, the European great powers attempted to undermine each other at every turn in the run-up to war. One of the ways they did that was by endless military exercises. Over time, these exercises got more complex, and added to the sense that a great war was coming.\n\nThe Bayou Warrior exercises at Barksdale were similar to those exercises as the militaries of the world today are jockeying against one another in ways not seen in decades. During the exercise, the Air Force trained with live missiles.\n\nLaunching live missiles is a costly move, and exercises like this in the 1990s and even the early 2000s were few and far between.\n\nAmerica's largest bomber wing, the 2nd Bomb Wing, is located at Barksdale. One official description of the exercise stated that the exercise was meant to \"generate, load, and deliver conventional weapons in a simulated environment.\" The entire point of the exercise, according to U.S. Air Force Col. Bryan J. Walter, the CO of the 2nd Operations Group said, \"[The Air Force inspector general's office] will come in, and they're going to give you a hard look at, 'Are you ready to go?'\"\n\nThis exercise was meant to test the Air Force's strategic readiness for potential long-range strike missions, which is why they used live munitions. The only reason the Air Force would be doing this is because the fear is real that a war with a near-peer competitor could happen.\n\nAt a time when the U.S. military is cash-strapped (despite having a combined budget of nearly $1 trillion), the Air Force is spending millions of dollars preparing its personnel for a real-world conflict. Of course, training is something all militaries do. And training in as close of an approximation to real-world conditions is the best way to ready one's military to be dominant.\n\nYet the nature of this particular training exercise, the kind of equipment involved, its scope, and the way in which the results of this exercise will be deployed across the wider force are what really matter.\n\nWe are, as I have written repeatedly both in these pages and elsewhere, on the brink of WWIII. What's more, the U.S. military is the least prepared for such a conflict. Multiple sources over the years have indicated that the military is the weakest it has been since the interwar years.\n\nThese sources are likely correct. There is a recruitment crisis. America's military equipment is worn down after 20 years of endless Mideast warfare. Our doctrines are no longer prepared for the kind of great power conflict we face today. The funding of the military is mismanaged. And America's defense industrial base is hopelessly depleted.\n\nThat's to say nothing of the nature of America's political leadership, which for many years has left much to be desired.\n\nThese increasingly assertive exercises are meant to signal U.S. military capabilities to American foes while giving the force much-needed real-world training. But these exercises are insufficient. Under current circumstances, the U.S. military will lose a war against China if that war erupts anywhere along what's known as the First Island Chain.\n\nThe United States, via NATO and Ukraine, is checkmated by Russia in the Ukraine War. It's obvious that Washington wants to avoid a wider Middle East war, as the situation between Israel and Iran reaches crisis levels.\n\nThe U.S. military cannot even effectively deter the Houthi rebels in Yemen, with their significant and growing anti-ship weapons capability. Meanwhile, Russian warships lurk off the coast of Florida, likely preparing to help Venezuela in its bid to conquer its oil rich neighbor of Guyana.\n\nSo, the U.S. military is doing what it knows how to do: It drills according to its best laid plans. But those plans were written in a bygone era. What's needed is an entirely new understanding of the geopolitical situation coupled with the kind of visionary leadership that can avoid the likes of a third world war that will destroy whatever is left of American power.\n\nFollowing plans that no longer reflect the geopolitical reality we now live in is a very dangerous thing to do indeed.\n\nBrandon J.

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Clinches a $4.5B Contract for PAC-3 MSE Missiles",
        "body": "Per major news sources, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently secured a multi-year contract worth $4.5 billion for its Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target Advanced Capability-3 missile from the U.S. Army. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will procure 870 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (\"MSE\") missiles and associated hardware.\n\nWhat's Favoring Lockheed?\n\nGlobal geopolitical and socioeconomic unrest has led both developed and emerging nations to increase the size of their armaments, with missiles making up a large share of these arsenals. Consequently, leading missile manufacturers such as Lockheed are witnessing a solid contract flow for their combat-proven missiles and associated hardware. The latest contract win is evidence of it.\n\nSpecifically, Lockheed's Missiles and Fire Control division develops cutting-edge combat missiles for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and several international allies of the United States. LMT's PAC-3 is a missile that is highly sophisticated and can protect against advanced threats, such as airplanes, cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles and tactical ballistic missiles.\n\nIn light of this, it is essential to note that 15 partner nations of the United States are currently using the PAC-3 family of missiles, with Lockheed having manufactured 17,000 PAC-3 MSEs so far. This undoubtedly illustrates the strong demand PAC-3 enjoys in the global missile industry.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nWith the ongoing hostilities in various regions of the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war, which has been going on for more than two years, the global peace index indicates an unstable environment. As a result, the demand for military weapons -- especially missiles -- has increased in the defense industry as countries attempt to defend their borders from previously unheard-of attacks.\n\nConsequently, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the global missiles and missiles defense system market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period. Such growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market should bode well for Lockheed, which is a prominent missile manufacturer.\n\nA PAC-3 MSE interceptor was launched by Lockheed in May 2024 from an MK-70 containerized launch vehicle to intercept a cruise missile target in flight, a notable move to expand the PAC-3 missile's market reach. With the help of the Virtualized Aegis Weapon System, PAC-3 MSE was deployed in this configuration for the first time to intercept a live target. It is anticipated that these modernization initiatives, along with the rising demand for missiles, will result in further PAC-3 missile contract wins, which will improve LMT's top line.\n\nPeer Prospects\n\nAs global threats continue to rise, apart from LMT, defense contractors that are likely to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the missiles and missile defense system market are as follows:\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It creates and manufactures warheads, fuses, sophisticated high-speed propulsion systems and other missile components. The company is one of the top suppliers of solid rocket propulsion for air-launched missiles, interceptors, submarine-launched weapons and hypersonic missile systems.\n\nNorthrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC's 2024 sales suggests growth of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nRTX Corp RTX: It offers a variety of combat-proven missile defense systems, including the Patriot missile, Standard Missiles, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, Evolved Seasparrow Missiles, the Tomahawk cruise missile and a few more. To keep up with its growing demand for a wide variety of missiles, RTX broke ground with a $115 million worth, 26,000-square-foot expansion of its Redstone Raytheon Missile Integration Facility in April 2024.\n\nRTX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales implies an improvement of 6.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nThe Boeing Company BA: For almost 25 years, Boeing has been providing the United States, its allies and international partners with air and missile defense systems. The Avenger Air Defense System, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense and a few additional missiles are among its product offerings.\n\nBA boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 25.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales suggests an improvement of 0.9% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nLockheed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Australia aims to boost local arms production. So far it's leaning foreign.",
        "body": "CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand -- Travis Reddy wants to buy a Brazilian weapons manufacturer.\n\nAs the CEO of DefendTex, an Australian firm specializing in precision-guided weapons, rockets and loitering munitions, he's encouraged by a government-run program aimed at growing the domestic industry's capability to build long-range weaponry. The problem, though, is he can't get the financial backing expected from the Australian government's Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise program.\n\nInstead, large defense contractors, especially those hailing from overseas, are receiving preferential treatment, according to a local analyst.\n\n\"There's a tendency by government to default to the primes. Everything must go through Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Thales or whatever. Let's see what SMEs [small and medium enterprises] can do in terms of things like long-range missiles,\" said Malcolm Davis, an expert in capability development and military technology at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. \"Give them a chance to actually demonstrate their capabilities.\"\n\nFor months, DefendTex has been asking Export Finance Australia -- the government's export credit agency -- for a yearlong AU$70 million (U.S. $46 million) loan to acquire cash-strapped Avibras in Brazil. Reddy said he's depending on the government to assist, noting that domestic banks have refused to provide him a loan as a weapons manufacturer.\n\nDefendTex's exclusive negotiation period with Avibras has reportedly expired, as the timetable was to last until the end of June. Already the Chinese defense industry giant NORINCO is taking steps to buy the business. To sweeten the deal, NORINCO has expressed a willingness to manufacture Chinese weapons in Brazil.\n\nBut Reddy said Australia could benefit from Avibras' extensive experience with guided weapons, gain intellectual property and quickly replicate manufacturing facilities on Australian soil. \"We know that within 24 months we'd achieve full-rate production in Australia: the full IP suite, the seeker, propulsion system, the whole box and dice.\"\n\nReferring to mounting geopolitical tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, Davis highlighted the government's slow response time with endeavors like the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) Enterprise.\n\n\"At the moment it seems to be moving very much at a snail's pace on a small scale, a very hesitant approach on the part of government, which I don't understand given the very adverse strategic outlook we're facing,\" he said.\n\nThe GWEO Enterprise program is the government's official vehicle to develop a sovereign capability for producing long-range strike weapons. It currently boasts about 900 personnel and was formally created in May 2023 when Air Marshal Leon Phillips was appointed its inaugural chief.\n\n\"The GWEO group was established to accelerate the development of a guided weapons and explosive ordnance manufacturing industry in Australia,\" Phillips told Defense News.\n\nHe outlined the enterprise's two main functions: to establish a manufacturing industry, and to manage the acquisition, sustainment and support of weapons. According to the Defence Department's website, the government is spending $4.1 billion to increasingly buy long-range strike systems and locally manufacture longer-range munitions.\n\nHowever, Reddy said the program's lean toward American defense companies is hindering plans like his.\n\nIndeed, the government has appointed the Australian arms of the American firms RTX and Lockheed Martin as GWEO's strategic partners.\n\n\"The strategic partners and their U.S. parent companies are working with [the Department of] Defence to explore opportunities for greater partnerships and, to this end, are developing detailed, costed plans for manufacturing guided weapons and their components in Australia,\" Phillips said.\n\nThe department has said it will consider those \"costed plans\" in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\"Support and assistance from the U.S. is critical to the success of the GWEO Enterprise. At the Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations in July 2023, the principals agreed to deepen cooperation on Australia's GWEO Enterprise by collaborating on a flexible guided-weapons production capability in Australia. This cooperation is underway, and an initial batch of GMLRS [Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System] missiles will be manufactured in Australia by 2025,\" Phillips added, referring to a AU$37.4 million contract for Lockheed Martin Australia, announced in January 2024.\n\nJames Heading, the director of programs at the Strategic Capabilities Office within Lockheed Martin Australia's missiles and fire control division, said further developing industry is critical and that GMLRS is a good starting point for the country. International demand for GMLRS is growing, especially in Ukraine amid its war with Russia.\n\n\"That doesn't necessarily mean everything's manufactured in Australia,\" Heading added. For example, he noted, it might be five to 10 years before Australian industry can unilaterally build missile seekers for the GMLRS.\n\nTenders for GMLRS production-related requirements in Australia close around the June-July time frame this year, which will lead to the assembly of GMLRS kits starting next year at the munitions storage base Defence Establishment Orchard Hills in Sydney. What will follow is the gradual introduction of domestically assembled components, before ramping up quantities, Heading said.\n\nTo be clear, Reddy said, he doesn't take issue with the Lockheed deal, but does think the government needs a backup plan.\n\n\"I'm not saying don't do GMLRS, don't do HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System]. Do all of that and preserve 5% of your budget [for] a plan B,\" he said, referring to government funding to support domestic industry acquisitions. \"That would be the pragmatic approach to ensuring we get the best of both worlds. So if the world goes to hell in a handbasket tomorrow, we've got something we can respond with.\"\n\nHe argued that the purchase of Avibras would be a \"very cheap\" insurance policy that does not detract from any long-term plans dependent on American firms.\n\nDavis agreed that there isn't a clear path from the Lockheed deal that would lead to more locally made, sophisticated capabilities. \"I think it's taken an inordinately long time to actually make any progress, and we're only talking about assembling GMLRS components here in Australia in 2025.\"\n\nHe said the government should encourage industry to pursue the local production of longer-range weapons like the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, the extended-range variant of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, and the Tomahawk cruise missile -- all of which are made by American businesses.\n\nBut the GWEO Enterprise isn't just about American-made weapons. For example, the Spike missile by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and the Naval Strike Missile by Norway's Kongsberg are both candidates for domestic production.\n\n\"GWEO is really about giving industry the opportunity to participate,\" Heading said, noting gaps in Australia's defense industry are due to capacity rather than ability.\n\nTo overcome these issues, Davis suggested the government further prioritize the GWEO program as well as incorporate lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\"We should actually be looking at how can we, ourselves, develop the long-range strike capabilities that can support the needs of the ADF [Australian Defence Force], the needs of our allies and partners, and offer us an export capability as well,\" he urged. \"Once again, there seems to be this lack of boldness and vision on the part of the government just to even think beyond the most minimalist application of GWEO in the near term.\n\n\"I don't understand why their perception of GWEO is so constrained and so limited.\"\n\nPart of the problem is Australia's peacetime mindset, Davis said.\n\n\"We assume that nothing bad will happen in this decade, and that we've got 10 years to wait. Ironically, we've said in past defense whitepapers that we no longer have 10 years of strategic warning, but that mindset of 10-year strategic warning time is still pervasive in the defense organization and within government,\" he explained.\n\n\"There needs to be recognition that we might have two, maybe three years to prepare for a major war,\" he added. \"So what can we do in the next two to three years in terms of mass production of capabilities? That's going to take some risks, it's going to take a bit of vision.\n\n\"My concern is that those decisions won't be made and we'll end up going into a next war in 2027 or 2028 with what we've got -- and not much to show for GWEO.\"\n\nTo be sure, the program hasn't been idle, Philips said, noting several major achievements to date, including upgrades to infrastructure and technology at the government-owned Mulwala and Benalla munitions factories operated by Thales Australia; remediation of the Port Wilson wharf to enable large-scale imports and exports of weapons; commissioned construction of additional storage and distribution infrastructure; and domestic production of 500-pound BLU-111 bombs.\n\nIn addition to the GMLRS contract, Phillips also pointed to accelerated acquisitions of Tomahawks, JASSM-ERs, Naval Strike Missiles and sea mines from overseas.\n\nBut these foreign purchases by the government don't help with situations like Reddy's.\n\n\"They're not taking any steps to develop a domestic, sovereign alternative to the kind of weapons they need,\" he said. \"In the event of high-intensity conflict, will Australia as a nation have the ability to manufacture the ordnance that it needs to keep the Australian Defence Force capable of conducting its mission? The overwhelming answer is no.\"",

        "body": "Even with 21% of the fleet parked, freighters will continue hauling a large share of global airfreight as the growth in bellyhold capacity slows, according to Tom Crabtree, MD of air cargo research and consulting firm Transport Research Advisory.\n\n\"All major tradelanes appear to be heading towards recovery in the first half,\" he said, pointing to a combination of strong e-commerce volumes and the disruption of ocean transport by the Red Sea crisis fuelling sea-air traffic.\n\nContainer capacity has been stretched by demand and the longer routings to avoid the Red Sea, resulting in extended transits reducing available capacity. And the differential between air and ocean cargo rates has dropped significantly in recent months.\n\nAirfreight capacity expansion has been driven by the recovery of passenger networks, producing a string of double-digit increases year on year, but the momentum has slowed, a trend Mr Crabtree expects to continue.\n\n\"Cargo space via belly capacity will continue to slow for the rest of 2024,\" he predicted.\n\nPassenger networks are more or less back to pre-Covid levels, except in the transpacific arena, notably on US-China. This is less a result of Covid, more the Russia-Ukraine war, which has closed Russian airspace to North American airlines, Mr Crabtree pointed out.\n\nUS airlines have successfully lobbied Washington to keep traffic rights to Chinese carriers at a diminished level while they enjoy an advantage in stage length and fuel burn. This has been a big factor behind the dominance of freighters in the transpacific arena.\n\nWhereas overall global airfreight traffic, as well as flows between the major regions, has seen the market share commanded by freighters slip from its 2021 level, it has actually expanded in the Asia-North America sector, from 82% in Q4 21 to 90% in Q4 23.\n\nEven the full restoration of passenger networks will not push the share of global traffic moving on freighter aircraft below the 50% mark, Mr Crabtree believes. In the final quarter of 2023, freighters carried 59% of global air cargo.\n\nIronically, the large widebody freighter fleet, which carries the lion's share of freight moved on all-cargo aircraft, has grown at a slow pace. Since 2013 it has expanded by about 140 units, he noted.\n\nMoreover, a large chunk, 21%, of the global fleet is currently parked - at the end of May, 602 freighter aircraft were stored, he pointed out. The bulk of the fleet reductions were in the narrowbody segment, with 348 aircraft out of service, accounting for 58% of freighters stored, while medium-sized (132) and widebodies (122) make up 22% and 20%, respectively.\n\nThe cull in active narrobody capacity (to which Mr Crabtree attributes, to a large extent, aircraft leasing firms having over-subscribed to e-commerce growth) has made a relatively minor dent in global maindeck capacity, as this segment generates a little over 10% of lift. Large widebodies make up 60-70%, while the contribution of medium widebody freighters is around 20%.\n\nAt the end of last year, 657 large widebody freighters were in service: 45% were B747s; 40% B777s; and 13% MD-11s;, with the remaining 2% being AN-124 and IL-96s.\n\nOver the past 18 months, the biggest reduction in this segment has played out in the MD-11 arena, which shrank from 111 units to 69, a drop of 38%. More will follow, as FedEx - one of the three remaining significant MD-11 operators - has announced plans to shrink its fleet further.\n\nThe global B747 fleet shrank by 11 (4%) in the past 18 months. The aircraft is still popular, but there have been indications that maintenance support for the 747-400 has become less readily available. Mr Crabtree said production models were still very much sought after, however, because of their nose door - but for operators of converted units, ultimately it would make sense to shift to large twin-engine freighters, he said.\n\n\"We are on the cusp of a major change in the large widebody segment,\" he added, noting that Boeing and Airbus had so far garnered 55 orders each for their planned 777-8F and A350 cargo planes.",

        "summary": "The article discusses significant changes in the freighter aircraft market, particularly in the large widebody segment. Despite 21% of the fleet being parked, freighters will continue to play a crucial role in global airfreight due to slow growth in bellyhold capacity. Tom Crabtree of Transport Research Advisory highlights that e-commerce and disruptions in ocean transport are driving airfreight demand. While passenger networks are recovering, especially outside the transpacific region, the Russia-Ukraine war has impacted US-China routes, favoring freighters.\n\nFreighters' market share has increased in the Asia-North America sector, and they carried 59% of global air cargo in Q4 2023. The large widebody freighter fleet has grown slowly, with a significant portion currently parked. Narrowbody freighters have seen the most reductions, but this has minimally impacted global capacity. The large widebody segment, dominated by B747s, B777s, and MD-11s, is poised for change as older models are phased out and new orders for Boeing 777-8F and Airbus A350 cargo planes are placed."

And with almost three Waltsreet analysts offering a 12-month average price forecast of $8.92, you should consider placing your money on this one.\n\nVAALCO Energy is set to thrive, with the prevailing geopolitical conditions seeing a shift from Russian oil to Western-produced energy, the company has a real potential to thrive.\n\nThe recent acquisition of Svenska Petroleum Exploration has also seen an increase in the company's production capacity, and ability to meet the increasing demand for Westen energy.\n\nSoundHound AI, Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) is an AI-enabled voice and speech recognition company investing in providing personalized customer experience across all industries. The company provides an AI-powered technology that trains in natural language, understanding which enables companies to utilize the existing data, as well as automate personalized responses to customers.\n\nSound Hound's penny stocks have been one of the hottest in the market for the past year, surging over 89% YTD. The company has also seen an astounding Q1 sales revenue increase of over 73%, hitting a record 11.9 million, surpassing market estimates by $1.49 million.\n\nWith the company's shares now trading just under $4, the projected tech trends favor tremendous growth and expansion of its operations. With AI titans such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) throwing their weight behind the company and almost all industries accepting AI to improve customer service, SoundHound AI has a real potential to grow.\n\nNeXalin Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:NXL) is a fast-rising pharmaceutical technology company investing in technologies to treat mental health conditions. The company's transcranial alternating current stimulation technology utilizes a non-invasive treatment method that uses a patented frequency waveform to stimulate a positive response in the patient's brain.\n\nThe company has witnessed tremendous growth since this new technology was approved by the FDA. While NeXalin's stock trades at just above $2, it is the most bullish penny stock to buy right now.\n\nRecently, it secured a patent for Alzheimer's deep-brain stimulation device, a non-invasion treatment procedure that will revolutionize the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. While the announcement came with an almost 50% surge in the company's stock prices, the company has the potential to grow, having developed a strategic lead in the non-invasive brain treatment technology. NeXalin is definitely one of the most promising penny stocks to buy this year.",

        "body": "Despite the brutality of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, support or sympathy toward Russia is shown by some actors on the international stage. This could be attributed to the multi-facet information warfare conducted by Russia and its strategic partner China. However, the analysis of information warfare during the current war remains scattered. This article, therefore, adopts a documentary analysis of relevant documents and media sources to conceptualize the forms of information warfare used by these two countries to contribute to future studies. It then proceeds to discuss that the Russia-Ukraine war implies a growing use of information warfare in present and future wars under digitalization. Facing a growing threat posed to people's cognitive understanding, the democratic community has to be aware of this increasingly dangerous military strategy and develop corresponding solutions. This article suggests that different societal stakeholders must collaborate to develop comprehensive education and thus strengthen digital citizenship. This is vital to nurturing people into critical and responsible citizens, thus equipping themselves with the resilience needed to combat information warfare.",

        "title": "It took a war for NATO members to actually take their obligations seriously with Biden at the helm",
        "body": "Despite President Joe Biden's claims that he helped strengthen NATO, a transatlantic alliance critically reliant on the U.S., it wasn't until a war broke out in Eastern Europe that alliance members started taking its defense spending commitments seriously.\n\nBiden has boasted on numerous occasions that he made NATO more powerful than former President Donald Trump did, helping to expand the alliance and restore its reputation on the global stage. But NATO members were spending less on defense under Biden until the Russia-Ukraine war broke out, prompting the alliance to finally increase spending, according to official alliance documents.\n\nBiden claimed during a debate against former President Donald Trump on Thursday that NATO was \"strong\" under his administration and bragged about how he got \"50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine,\" warning that Trump would pull out of the alliance if reelected.\n\nHis comments echo remarks made weeks and months earlier, in which he claimed his administration was responsible for NATO's success.\n\n\"Trump wants to eviscerate NATO. He thinks NATO is useless,\" Biden told Time in an interview in June. \"NATO is considerably stronger than it was when I took office. I put it together. Not only did I reestablish the fact that it was the strongest alliance in the history of the world, I was able to expand it.\"\n\n\"America is a founding member of NATO,\" Biden said during his State of the Union address in March. \"Today, we've made NATO stronger than ever.\"\n\nNATO members are currently spending more on defense than they have in the last decade. Members of NATO, including the U.K. Canada, and the European Union (EU) nations, are obligated to spend at least 2% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defense spending as part of their alliance agreement.\n\n\"I've worked really hard, spent hours and hours and hours doing this,\" Biden said on NATO in a May interview with Howard Stern, who thanked him for working on making the alliance stronger. \"And the idea that had we not gotten this done, I think you would've seen a beginning of disintegration of NATO.\"\n\nIt is expected that 23 of the 32 members will hit the 2% minimum in 2024, up from 10 members the year prior, according to NATO defense expenditures.\n\nThe jump in spending comes alongside the surging Russia-Ukraine war, which has engulfed Eastern Europe and concerned members that Moscow could target them next. Prior to and during the immediate aftermath of the Russia war, fewer NATO members were meeting their spending targets under Biden than they were under Trump.\n\nOnly seven NATO members hit their spending goals in 2022, up from six in 2021, according to alliance defense expenditures. In 2020, Trump's last full year in office, nine members were hitting their spending targets.\n\nTrump routinely pressured members of NATO to meet their defense spending goals during his tenure, threatening to pull the U.S. out of the alliance if they didn't. The number of NATO countries meeting their spending targets more than doubled from the start to the end of Trump's presidency, before dropping in 2021 once Biden took office, according to expenditures.\n\n\"The only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. I said, and he is right about this, I said, 'No, I'm not going to support NATO if you don't pay, I won't do that,\" Trump said during Thursday's debate. \"And you know what happened? Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months. But now, we're in the same position. We're paying everybody's bills.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Biden has frequently stated that he made NATO more powerful than it was under former President Donald Trump, who had pressured NATO members to meet their spending goals and threatened to pull the U.S. out of the alliance if they didn't. Under Biden, fewer NATO members were meeting their spending targets until the war in Eastern Europe prompted an increase in defense expenditures. Currently, 23 out of 32 NATO members are expected to meet the 2% GDP defense spending requirement in 2024, up from 10 the previous year. The article highlights the contrast between Biden's and Trump's approaches to NATO and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the alliance's defense spending."

        "title": "Save the World, Chuck! \" American Greatness",
        "body": "After Thursday night's disastrous debate performance, the whole world sees what those who were paying attention have known for some time: The leader of the free world, President Joe Biden, is an empty chair. Mr. Biden no longer has the mental capacity or stamina to perceive events comprehensively and make decisions based on that perspective.\n\nAs a partisan Republican, I have strong reasons for not wanting to see Joe go. A weakened man is a weak candidate, and a weak candidate is a weak rival to my party's preferred alternative, Mr. Trump. But however the race goes, the United States only has one president at a time, and -- unless something is done -- until January 20, 2025, more than six long months away, that president is Joe Biden.\n\nJust focusing on foreign policy alone, Mr. Biden's empty-chair administration has been disastrous. When the president doesn't choose a policy, nobody else can choose for him. Instead, without guidance, each piece of the bureaucracy follows its own priorities and acts on its own agenda, even when those agendas make no sense when taken simultaneously.\n\nMost spectacularly, the administration hasn't chosen sides between Israel and Hamas but supports both sides in that terrible war, with money, with supplies, and with rhetoric. As Mr. Trump said in the debate, effectively, Mr. Biden \"has become like a Palestinian. But they don't like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\" A similar point applies to the Russia-Ukraine war, where the US has intervened to prevent a compromise peace but has not offered the aid that would enable Ukraine to win. And thanks to the combination of Russian aggression and American dithering, the world is closer to thermonuclear holocaust than it has ever been. That peril will not wait for the Electoral College.\n\nSo what can be done? The US Constitution offers two methods for shunting aside an unfit President before the end of his term. There is the complicated and untested mechanism of section 4 of the 25th Amendment: \"Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.\"\n\nBut that mechanism has never been used, much less the following provision: if the President contests the claim of incapacity, Congress should decide.\n\nThere is, however, a better way.\n\nIf the Democratic House and Senate leadership would put country and the fate of the world over party, go to the Republican leadership, and say \"this cannot go on,\" an impeachment in the House and trial and removal in the Senate could be done in a few days.\n\nTrue, in either case, the buck would stop with Vice President Harris, either as acting president or as the real thing, and many in and outside the Democrat Party do not see her as an effective chief executive. But she is at least smart and aware enough to hear the warring bureaucrats, choose a consistent policy, and, if ably served, make everybody work for its success. Like any President, Ms. Harris might make a wrong decision, but she would at least decide.\n\nSo what will it be, Senate Majority Leader Schumer? Will you go to the Republican House and Senate leadership and offer to work together to put an actual President behind the Resolute desk, even if that means undermining your nominal President and embarrassing your party? Or will you do nothing and hope that the ship of state remains afloat despite the stormy waters, the looming rocks, and the senile captain?\n\n\"Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?\"",

        "summary": "The article from \"American Greatness\" criticizes President Joe Biden's performance, particularly highlighting his perceived lack of mental capacity and stamina, which was evident during a recent debate. The author, a partisan Republican, argues that Biden's inability to make decisive policies has led to chaotic foreign policy, notably in the Israel-Hamas conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war. The article suggests that Biden's indecisiveness has brought the world closer to nuclear conflict.\n\nThe author proposes two constitutional methods to address Biden's perceived incapacity: invoking the 25th Amendment or impeachment. The 25th Amendment allows the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to declare the President unfit, but this process is complex and untested. Alternatively, the author suggests that bipartisan cooperation between Democratic and Republican leaders could lead to a swift impeachment and removal of Biden.\n\nThe article concludes by urging Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to prioritize the country's well-being over party loyalty and work with Republicans to replace Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris, who, despite criticisms, is seen as more capable of making decisions."

        "title": "SEP member R. calls for release of Bogdan Syrotiuk on Tamil Nadu YouTube channel",
        "body": "facebook icon\n\nOn June 23, R. Shreeharan, a Political Committee member of the Socialist Equality Party in Sri Lanka, was interviewed by the \"Let's Talk Everything\" YouTube channel about the US-NATO-orchestrated war against Russia in Ukraine and the International Committee of the Fourth International's campaign for the release Bogdan Syrotiuk.\n\nThe channel, which has over 23,000 subscribers and 250,000 viewers, is based in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is connected to \"Let's Talk History,\" another YouTube channel that has over 61,000 subscribers and 3.5 million viewers. Both channels are broadcast in Tamil by Gabriel Devadoss.\n\nThe English-language title of Shreeharan's interview read, \"Is the Russia-Ukraine war spreading to other parts of the world?\" Its Tamil title page said, \"Will the Russia-Ukraine war change into a nuclear war? The ultimate target of the US is to collide with China.\" The 30-minute interview has been watched by 4,000 people so far with most viewers commenting positively.\n\nShreeharan discussed the ongoing proxy war in Ukraine against Russia, the danger of a nuclear third world war, and the detention of socialist Bogdan Syrotiuk by Ukraine's Zelensky government. Syrotiuk is the secretary of Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninist (YGBL), which is affiliated to the International Committee of Fourth International (ICFI), and a writer for the World Socialist Web Site.\n\nGabriel Devadoss began the interview by noting the alignment of the US-led imperialist powers one side and Russia, North Korea and China on the other.\n\nShreeharan responded by explaining that the US had initially promised not to cross various \"red lines\" in Ukraine but that the Biden administration, with the help of the Republicans, had crossed all these lines, providing battle tanks, missiles, billions of dollars and allowing Ukraine to attack inside Russia with US-provided long-range missiles.\n\n\"NATO forces have already entered Ukraine in the name of training soldiers in the new technology provided by US. Now the US is planning to send NATO troops to Ukraine because it has suffered military debacles and the loss of half a million soldiers so far,\" he said.\n\n\"Putin, however, cannot tolerate bombs and missiles exploding in Russian cities and will be compelled to retaliate and NATO can retaliate if any its member states is attacked. Such a scenario would trigger a world war that would be a massive human catastrophe.\n\n\"There are now discussions within the US political establishment that the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki 'ended the war' and so justify the use of nuclear weapons to end [current] wars,\" he added.\n\nA question was asked about the situation facing Putin and whether he would choose to use nuclear weapons. Shreeharan explained how Putin had been provoked by the eastward expansion of NATO over decades and the encirclement of Russia by NATO forces.\n\n\"Putin expected a compromise with the imperialist powers by making nuclear threats and launching a war on Ukraine. He miscalculated that the imperialist powers, fearing an all-out war, would roll back. The major powers, however, want to occupy and plunder resource-rich Russia in preparation for war against China as the next step, and ultimately domination of the world,\" he said.\n\nEmphasising this point, the SEP Political Committee member quoted NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg who has stated, \"What happens in Europe matters for Asia. What happens in Asia matters for us. And this is clearly demonstrated in Ukraine, where Iran, North Korea and China are propping up and fuelling Russia's war aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\nConfronted with this sort of war situation, Shreeharan continued, \"Putin would be forced to launch a counter-offensive and may use nuclear weapons... However, the imperialist powers themselves could use nuclear weapons which would create a catastrophe. The US needs a war to challenge the growth of China.\" The speaker later pointed out that some US politicians had suggested the Gaza war could be ended by using nuclear weapons.\n\nResponding to a question about European opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Shreeharan elaborated on the role played by Germany in the 2014 coup and Washington's efforts to topple the then-elected pro-Moscow Ukraine government and replace it with a pro-US regime.\n\nShreeharan explained the Trotskyist movement's opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, referring to an ICFI statement issued at the outset of the war which said, \"Putin does not stand for the Russian working class but represents the oligarchs in the country and stands for their profit interests.\"\n\nTurning to the suppression of democratic rights in Ukraine and Russia, Shreeharan explained the two-month detention of YGBL secretary Bogdan Syrotiuk:\n\n\"As previously noted, the US in 2014 funded the overthrow of the elected Ukrainian government in a coup and now extreme-right organisations that follow the principles of Stephen Bandera, a Nazi, are very active.\n\n\"The entire Zelensky regime operates as a fascist regime with no one allowed to speak out against the war and opposition parties and communists are banned. But now, under conditions where 500,000 soldiers have been killed, there is popular opposition to war. People are now being forcibly drafted into the military and put on the frontline. This is why the socialist Bogdan Syrotiuk was arrested. This is a matter of freedom of expression,\" Shreeharan said\n\n\"Anti-war sentiment prevails in Ukraine\" he continued, and said the Zelensky regime was concerned that this mass opposition will be given expression through organisations such as the YGBL. \"There is a fear that it could become a pole of attraction for the mass opposition. That's why they arrested Bogdan.\n\n\"Bogdan is fighting to unite the Ukrainian and Russian working class, as well as the international working class, to end the war and for an international socialist program to overthrow the capitalist system. He was arrested because of this fight,\" he said.\n\nShreeharan explained that the Zelensky regime had falsely accused Bogdan of treason and subsequently banned World Socialist Web Site in Ukraine, claiming that it functioned as 'a Russian propaganda and information agency.'\n\n\"This is how the democratic rights are being brutally suppressed in Ukraine,\" he said and called on viewers to sign the petition and support the ICFI's campaign to release Bogdan.\n\nShreeharan said Putin, as a representative of the Russian oligarchy, promoted anti-migrant and right-wing movements while suppressing opposition protests.\n\n\"Neither Putin nor Biden, however, can wage a war allowing democratic rights. Inevitably they are compelled to use dictatorial rule to suppress working people who are rising up against the slashing of social conditions and the imposition of the massive costs of war,\" he said.\n\nThe speaker noted Putin's alliances with North Korea and China and warned that US-NATO war operations against Russia would escalate and expand into military conflict with China. To stop this worsening catastrophe, he said, \"The working class must unite and fight against their imperialist governments and fight to bring workers' governments to power. This is possible.\n\n\"The First World War was ended by the socialist revolution in Russia in 1917 under the leadership of Lenin and Trotsky. That is why the ICFI, its sections, and the WSWS are fighting to build an anti-war movement of the international working class,\" Shreeharan said.\n\nThe speaker pointed to the eruption of massive protests across the US universities against the Gaza genocide, strike action by academics against police attacks on student protesters at the University of California, and ongoing demonstrations internationally against Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nShreeharan explained that the trade unions in the US, and internationally, were sabotaging and suppressing these struggles. He called for workers to break from these organisations and pseudo-left formations that justify imperialism and war.\n\n\"Workers must mobilise their political strength independently. In this way workers can take matters into their own hands by building action committees in their workplaces and creating unity among workers, that could pave the way for an international working-class solidarity.\"\n\nRead moreStop the US-NATO escalation toward nuclear war!

Shreeharan, a member of the Socialist Equality Party in Sri Lanka, was interviewed on the Tamil Nadu-based YouTube channel \"Let's Talk Everything\" about the US-NATO war against Russia in Ukraine and the campaign for the release of Ukrainian socialist Bogdan Syrotiuk. The channel, hosted by Gabriel Devadoss, has a significant following.\n\nShreeharan discussed the proxy war in Ukraine, the risk of a nuclear conflict, and the detention of Syrotiuk by Ukraine's Zelensky government. Syrotiuk, affiliated with the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI), was arrested for his anti-war stance and efforts to unite the working class against the war.\n\nShreeharan criticized the US for crossing \"red lines\" in Ukraine, leading to potential global conflict, and highlighted the imperialist motives behind the war. He emphasized the need for international working-class unity to oppose imperialist wars and called for support in the campaign to release Syrotiuk, who faces false treason charges and suppression of democratic rights in Ukraine."

        "title": "Cyber Extortion Reached Record High in US and Canada in 2023: Marsh",
        "body": "Multiple companies in the United States and Canada experienced a record number of cyber extortion events in 2023 and unprecedented demands, a new report from Marsh shows.\n\nThe report, Ransomware: A persistent challenge in cyber insurance claims, also showed an increasing number of companies refused to pay the demands.\n\nThe report's authors analyzed more than 1,800 cyber claims submitted to Marsh in the U.S. and Canada in 2023. They found the annual percentage of clients reporting at least one cyber event has was steady over the past five years, ranging between 16% and 21%. The authors say the report demonstrates that companies' cyber controls have kept pace with the growing threat and frequency of cyberattacks.\n\nHealthcare, communications, retail/wholesale, financial institutions and education were the top five of most affected industry sectors, with healthcare and communications reaching the highest numbers of annual claims, the report shows.\n\n21% of clients that purchased a cyber policy reported an event in 2023.\n\n*\n\nIn 2023, events were driven by factors including increased sophistication of cyberattacks; the MOVEit event, a wave of cyberattacks and data breaches that began in June of that year, highlighting supply chain vulnerabilities; and privacy claims.\n\n*\n\nRansomware represented less than one-fifth of claims reported, but remained a top concern for organizations given their increased frequency, sophistication and potential severity.\n\nThe record number of events in 2023 followed a dip in extortion events in 2022. The reasons for the decrease in 2022 is hard to say, but cybersecurity experts inside and outside of Marsh cite a temporary move away from data encryption toward exfiltration, disruptions brought on by the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, decreased willingness of some companies to pay and the successful \"infiltration\" of a particular ransomware group by the FBI.\n\nThe median extortion payment fell from $822,000 in 2021 to $335,000 in 2022. That trend was reversed in 2023, when the median payment increased from $335,000 to $6.5 million and the median demand increased from $1.4 million to $20 million. The percentage of the median demand paid increased from 24% in 2022 to 32% in 2023, according to the report.\n\nDuring the last five quarters, the median cost of breach response expenses remained at $160,000, while the average trended from $963,000 in the third quarter of 2023 to $1 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to a few large cyber events, Marsh said.\n\nRansomware claims also rose in 2023, but the report shows the number of reported ransomware events has remained under 20% of reported claims for the past two years.\n\n\"This means that privacy claims and system attacks leading to unauthorized access and potentially exposed data without an extortion component comprise a much larger share of cyber events reported by Marsh clients than do those with an extortion component,\" the report states.\n\nAnother report out in May found 51% of respondents ranked ransomware as the primary cyber concern for the third straight year, with 45% claiming to have been hit by a ransomware attack in the last 12 months. A large majority, 86%, said these attacks included data exfiltration.",

Another survey indicated that ransomware remained the top cyber concern for the third consecutive year, with 45% of respondents experiencing an attack in the past year, most involving data exfiltration."

        "body": "According to Gibson, \"nonetheless, despite the increase in scheduled deliveries in 2025 and 2026, the number of tankers in the 15-to-19-year bracket is still higher. In addition, another 13% of the current fleet is 20 years of age or over, with many of these vessels finding alternative employment opportunities outside the conventional market, primarily on the back of changing geopolitical dynamics. The Russia-Ukraine war coupled with the Red Sea crisis has boosted tonne miles demand. At the same time, the growing influx of vessels into the dark fleet has pulled tonnage from the mainstream MR market helping to support rates. We currently estimate that 181 out of approximately 1,720 vessels in the MR fleet are exclusively trading in Iran, Venezuela, and Russia. This significant portion, which is around 10% of the fleet, is substantial enough for their absence from the main trade to be felt\".\n\nThe shipbroker said that \"the combination of growing demand and tightening supply of tankers available to international players is supporting the consistent strength in the MR market. For the year to date, global spot TCE earnings have averaged $35,000/day (non-Eco) and $31,250/day in 2022/23. This compares to an average of $13,500/day between 2010 and 2019. Structural changes in clean tanker flows due to sanctions on Russia are likely to stay in place for the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, there is a great degree of uncertainty when it comes to Red Sea attacks. It is impossible to predict how long the Israel/Gaza conflict will last, but if/when tanker traffic through the Red Sea resumes, it will have negative implications for clean tonne miles demand, although it will be felt most acutely by larger product carriers. For the MR trade specifically, the Dangote refinery in West Africa and the Olmeca refinery in Mexico could disrupt the traditional structure of the clean trade, potentially harming the market. On the upside, however, the earmarked closure of multiple refineries in Europe between 2025 and 2027 may still facilitate regional CPP imports despite disappointing demand indicators\".\n\n\"The exact effects of these demand-side developments are yet to play out. On supply side, however, the picture is much clearer: unless the orderbook continues to grow, the size of the fleet under 20 years of age will continue to shrink\", Gibson concluded.\n\nNikos Roussanoglou, Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide",

        "summary": "The news article discusses the potential impact of an aging Medium Range (MR) product tanker fleet on future market prospects. Key points include:\n\n1. **Aging Fleet**: A significant portion of the MR tanker fleet is aging, with many vessels over 15 years old and 13% over 20 years old, often finding alternative employment due to geopolitical changes.\n2. **Geopolitical Factors**: The Russia-Ukraine war and the Red Sea crisis have increased demand for tankers, while many vessels are now trading in Iran, Venezuela, and Russia, reducing the mainstream fleet by about 10%.\n3. **Market Impact**: The combination of rising demand and a tightening supply of tankers has supported strong market rates, with global spot TCE earnings significantly higher than the 2010-2019 average.\n4. **Future Uncertainties**: The Israel/Gaza conflict and potential disruptions from new refineries in West Africa and Mexico could negatively impact the market, while refinery closures in Europe might boost regional imports.\n5. **Supply Concerns**: Without an increase in new orders, the fleet of tankers under 20 years old will continue to shrink, potentially affecting market dynamics.\n\nThe article concludes that while demand-side effects are uncertain, the supply-side outlook is clearer, emphasizing the need for fleet renewal to maintain market stability."

        "body": "Several United States military bases across Europe were put on a heightened state of alert over the weekend due to concerns that a potential terrorist attack could target personnel or facilities, according to CNN who spoke to U.S. officials on Sunday.\n\nU.S. Army garrison in Stuttgart, Germany, where U.S. European Command (EUCOM) is headquartered, issued a community-wide elevated alert level to Force Protection Condition (FPCON) \"Charlie\" on Sunday until further notice. The alert status aims to ensure readiness and rapid response capabilities for any potential threats in the region.\n\nAccording to CNN, who spoke to one of the U.S. officials who is stationed at a base in Europe, said they haven't seen this threat level \"in at least 10 years,\" and said it usually means the military has received an \"active-reliable threat.\"\n\nThe U.S. Army employs a system called FPCON to assess and communicate the level of threat to military personnel and resources. These conditions range from normal peacetime operations to the highest state of alert in response to specific threats. According to the U.S. Army, the five FPCON levels are Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie or Delta, the highest state of alert.\n\nHowever, Bravo, which indicates an increased or more predictable threat of terrorist activity, became common and implemented widely as a preventive measure to enhance security and preparedness across all Department of Defense (DOD) facilities for many years following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Meanwhile, Charlie sets in motion \"curtailment plans for nonessential personnel.\"\n\nAlthough it's unclear what triggered the heightened security level, European authorities have warned of a potential terror threat on the continent due to highly public events such the Paris Olympics in July and the current European football championships in Germany.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the U.S. Army and the DOD via email for comment.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Army, the Charlie level of alert \"applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely.\"\n\nAddressing the alert on Sunday, EUCOM said in a statement that it is \"constantly assessing a variety of factors that play into the safety of the U.S. military community abroad. As part of that effort, we often times take additional steps to ensure the safety of our service members.\"\n\nMeanwhile, garrison officials in Stuttgart said that a variety of services would be affected because of the increased threat level, adding that until further notice some of those reduced services include access to some eateries and on-post barber shops.\n\n\"Many other services will have significant numbers of employees teleworking or offices will be opened with reduced staff. Customers should maintain flexibility and allow for longer-than-normal service times,\" the garrison said in a statement.\n\nIn addition to the garrison in Stuttgart, the Charlie level alert is also in place at the Aviano Air Base in Italy, according to Stars and Stripes.\n\nThe alert comes after President Joe Biden's announcement at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) summit in Madrid in June 2022 highlighted a significant increase in U.S. military presence in Europe, with over 100,000 U.S. service members now stationed across the continent. This includes the establishment of a permanent headquarters for the U.S. 5th Army Corps in Poland, aimed at improving command and control, interoperability with NATO allies, and overall defensive readiness.\n\nIn addition, Biden said he would also deploy additional air defense, logistics and engineer assets in Germany and add air defense capabilities to forces in Italy.\n\n\"NATO is strong, united, and the steps we're taking during this summit are going to further augment our collective strength,\" the president said at the time. \"To that end, today, I'm announcing the United States will enhance our force posture in Europe to respond to the change [in the] security environment, as well as strengthening our collective security.\"\n\nBiden's announcement comes as a response to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. In addition, tensions between NATO countries and the Kremlin have continued as NATO leaders have increasingly warned that direct conflict with Moscow is a realistic danger. This comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin and senior Russian officials have repeatedly threatened nuclear escalation against Kyiv and its Western partners since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",

Biden attempted to defend his record, which needs a lot of defending, leaving the queasy feeling that neither man is really fit to be president.\"\n\nBolton does not mention who to vote for.\n\n\"Claiming Biden was weak didn't deter Trump from also calling him a warmonger: 'These are wars that will never end with him. He will drive us into World War III and we're closer to World War Three than anybody can imagine,'\" Bolton wrote, quoting the debate. \"'President Xi of China, Kim Jong Un of North Korea, all of these - Putin - they don't respect him. They don't fear him.'\n\n\"In Trump's surreal world, all of this makes sense.\"\n\nBolton does not explain why Trump's reasoning is not reality - he even though his words appear to agree.\n\n\"On Ukraine, Trump continued claiming that, had he been president, Russia never would have invaded (again unprovable but also irrefutable),\" Bolton wrote. \"He pledged to resolve the Russia-Ukraine war as president-elect, even before being inaugurated next Jan. 20.\"\n\nUltimately, Biden's reelection campaign took a hit Thursday night, because of the reality Trump and conservative media have been trying to get Americans to hear: Biden's weakness is threat to global security.\n\n\"The coming days will determine whether Biden survives as the presumptive Democratic nominee,\" Bolton concluded. \"Even if he does, however, it is harder than before to deny he is in serious, potentially fatal political trouble - and at a time when the free world has rarely been in greater need of effective leadership.\"\n\nEric Mack ✉\n\nEric Mack has been a writer and editor at Newsmax since 2016.

        "body": "President Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN). Her euro-skeptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nParticipation was high, underlining how France's rumbling political crisis has energized the electorate. By 1500 GMT, turnout was nearly 60%, compared with 39.42% two years ago - the highest comparable turnout figures since the 1986 legislative vote, Ipsos France's research director Mathieu Gallard said.\n\nFrance's electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of the second round of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" Le Pen said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her protégé, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, would be prime minister.\n\nShe has sought to detoxify a party known for racism and antisemitism, a tactic that has worked amid voter anger at Macron, the high cost of living and growing concerns over immigration.\n\nIn Hénin-Beaumont, a town in Le Pen's constituency in northern France where she may be re-elected in the first round, 67-year-old Denis Ledieu said people were suffering due to the long-term de-industrializaton of the region.\n\n\"So if the (RN) promises them things, then why not? They want to try it out, I think,\" he said.\n\nIn Garches, a small town near Paris, a woman screamed \"It's shameful, it's shameful\" as Bardella arrived to cast his vote.\n\n\"They even invited the leftists,\" he said.\n\nOn the other side of Paris, in the town of Meaux, 51-year-old Mylène Diop said she had voted for the New Popular Front, a hastily assembled left-wing coalition polling in second. She said it was \"the most important election\" of her life.\n\n\"The RN is at the gates of power and you see the aggressiveness of people and the racist speech that has been unleashed,\" she said.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella says he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of its contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity on defense.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVORS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33%-36% of the popular vote, with the New Popular Front in second place on 28%-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20%-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate center-left to the hard-left, euro-skeptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favors the National Rally,\" Martigny said.\n\nFor decades, as the RN steadily gained popularity, voters and parties joined forces to block it from winning power, but that may not hold true this time.",

The election has energized voters, with turnout reaching nearly 60% by mid-afternoon, the highest since 1986.\n\nLe Pen has attempted to rebrand the RN, historically associated with racism and antisemitism, amid public discontent over Macron's policies, the cost of living, and immigration. A potential RN victory could lead to a turbulent period in French politics, with Macron and Bardella vying for influence. This could strain France's relationship with the EU and alter its stance on the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nThe New Popular Front, a left-wing coalition, is polling second, while Macron's alliance is third. The complex electoral system makes it difficult to predict the final distribution of seats, but high participation and split voting could favor the RN. Historically, other parties have united to block the RN, but this may not happen in this election."

By midday, turnout was at 25.9%, compared with 18.43% two years ago - the highest comparable turnout figures since the 1981 legislative vote, Ipsos France's research director Mathieu Gallard said.\n\nFrance's electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of the second round of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" Le Pen said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her protégé, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, would be prime minister.\n\nShe has sought to detoxify a party known for racism and antisemitism, a tactic that has worked amid voter anger at Macron, the high cost of living and growing concerns over immigration.\n\nIn Hénin-Beaumont, a town in Le Pen's constituency in northern France where she may be re-elected in the first round, 67-year-old Denis Ledieu said people were suffering due to the long-term deindustrializaton of the region.\n\n\"So if the (RN) promises them things, then why not? They want to try it out, I think,\" he said.\n\nIn Garches, a small town near Paris, a woman screamed \"It's shameful, it's shameful\" as Bardella arrived to cast his vote.\n\n\"They even invited the leftists,\" he said.\n\nOn the other side of Paris, in the town of Meaux, 51-year-old Mylène Diop said she had voted for the New Popular Front, a hastily assembled left-wing coalition polling in second. She said it was \"the most important election\" of her life.\n\n\"The RN is at the gates of power and you see the aggressiveness of people and the racist speech that has been unleashed,\" she said.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella says he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of its contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33%-36% of the popular vote, with the New Popular Front in second place on 28%-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20%-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" Martigny said.\n\nFor decades, as the RN steadily gained popularity, voters and parties joined forces to block it from winning power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ardee Napolitano and Janis Laizans in Hénin-Beaumont and Clotaire Achi, Imad Creidi, Lucien Libert in Paris; Writing by Estelle Shirbon and Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Frances Kerry, Gareth Jones and Andrew Heavens)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

        "body": "DARTFORD, England -- Distrust has settled over the campaign trails in the United States and United Kingdom ahead of July 4 like a soggy summer haze.\n\nOn that day, British voters will choose a new Parliament in an election expected to finish with a Labour government after 14 years under the Conservatives. Americans, polarized by the rematch between Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, will mark Independence Day in something resembling unity with barbecues and fireworks ahead of their vote on Nov. 5.\n\nThere's much to celebrate on the Fourth of July for one of the world's biggest democracies and the venerable kingdom that gave rise to it, 248 years after they split and set off on slow, troubled journeys toward granting all citizens the right to vote. Both remain rooted in the Magna Carta, the English document signed in 1215. It set in writing the idea that leaders -- including kings, presidents and their governments -- are not above the law. The nations have become close friends and stalwart allies.\n\n\"I'm just very disheartened, really, because I don't think any of the parties know what they're doing,\" Dartford, England, resident Jacqueline Richards, 77, said of her country's election. \"But then looking at yours in America, it's not that great, is it?\"\n\nEvery democratic election is, at its core, about who voters trust to run their country so they can go about running their lives.\n\nDebates are candidate aptitude tests in real time. Thursday's showdown between Biden, 81, and Trump, 77, proved a stark example. Biden's halting performance did the opposite of building confidence, even among some of his supporters. Trump, meanwhile, repeated his lies about the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and his record as president.\n\nThat's only the most recent example of why distrust and resignation dominate the emotional landscape in both countries, according to voters interviewed by The Associated Press in recent weeks. From battleground Wisconsin to bellwether Dartford, voters said years of misinformation, scandal and lies have drained them of the sort of optimism or excitement they might once have felt about the right to vote or the future.\n\nIn Britain, 45% said they \"almost never\" trust governments to put the nation's interest first, up from 34% in 2019, according to a survey published June 12 by the National Centre for Social Research. The pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine War and the country's cost-of-living crisis affected living standards and the economy, it reported. Two Tory prime ministers were ousted. Also, there was Boris Johnson, who resigned rather than be thrown out of Parliament over boozy parties at 10 Downing Street when the nation was under COVID-19 lockdown.\n\n\"They promise and promise and promise and nothing ever changes,\" said Shane Bassett, 34, the bar manager at a pub in Dartford, where the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 is said to have started. \"No matter who gets in -- if it's Labour, if it's Conservative, it's all the same. They all lie.\"\n\nIn the United States, trust has been eroded by deepening political polarization, misinformation and Trump's lies about Biden's victory in the 2020 election -- all amplified by social media.\n\nRoughly 2 in 10 Americans say they trust the U.S. government to do what is right \"just about always\" or \"most of the time,\" according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. About 6 in 10 say they can trust the government \"only some of the time\" and about 2 in 10 say they can never trust the government to do what's right.\n\nNearly three-quarters of American adults blame the news media for dividing the nation, according to a 2023 poll by AP-NORC. Families and friends have learned to avoid discussing politics around Thanksgiving tables and other gatherings. In many places, even celebrations of the Fourth of July -- a national holiday when Americans mark the 1776 ratification of the Declaration of Independence from Britain -- fall under this practice of restraint.\n\nIn Racine, Wisconsin, Rebecca Eisel, 48, wondered how the vast United States, home of 262 million eligible voters and the world's biggest economy, faces a rematch that few Americans wanted.\n\n\"How did our democratic process result in something that the majority of the population doesn't like?\" said Eisel, 48.\n\nThe last time Kathleen Barker, 64, was excited about a candidate, it was Ronald Reagan, who went on to serve two terms in the 1980s and exited office by referring to the country as a \"shining city on a hill.\"\n\n\"You could relate to him,\" she said while walking her dog near the river in Racine. \"He felt like just that average man.\"\n\nNow she says, the \"nasty back and forth\" between Biden and Trump -- who each insist the other is unfit for office -- suggest neither can be trusted to dig into the major problems facing the United States.\n\n\"People are poor. The country is struggling. And this is their focus?\" she said.\n\nEmmanuel McKinstry, a 58-year-old businessperson, voiced similar frustration. The economy, he said while waiting in line to hear Trump speak in Racine, is his top issue. The next morning, McKinstry said he'd still vote for Trump -- with reservations.\n\n\"I'm tired of politicians working for themselves and not really getting down and asking people what we really want,\" McKinstry said. \"We're putting you in office. What are you gonna do for us?\"\n\nIn Britain, the distrust is less personal. It's about scandal -- think Johnson and \"partygate\" -- and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nThat's what concerns Bassett, the manager at the Wat Tyler Pub. You're not supposed to talk about politics in British pubs, he says -- the counterpart, perhaps, of the American reluctance to stir up trouble on the same topic at parties.\n\nBut Bassett looked around at the empty dining room at lunch time. There were no customers to offend. So he let it fly.\n\nThe pub's energy bill last winter jumped from its usual 800 pounds a month (about $1,000) to 1,200 pounds (about $1,500). It has struggled since the Christmas season to bring in customers for a beer. He thinks the owners are likely to sell the place only four years after buying it.\n\n\"I'm not very optimistic,\" he said. \"If I could leave the country, I would.\"\n\nChristine Fernando reported from Racine, Wisconsin.

        "body": "(Chris Samuels | The Salt Lake Tribune) The Capitol and the Church Office Building, Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2024. While the church sharpens its global focus, it's become less vocal on political issues within the United States.\n\nIt is no surprise that Latter-day Saints have an outsized love for July Fourth, the day to celebrate the birth of America.\n\nAfter all, the United States is where Mormons believe founder Joseph Smith saw God and Jesus in a New York grove of trees, where the nascent church was founded.\n\nAnd for most of its nearly 200-year history, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been dominated by Americans, has sometimes endorsed major U.S. policies (including the invasion of Iraq) and has celebrated the nation as a divinely endorsed \"land of promise.\"\n\nThese days, though, the 17.2 million-member church sees itself -- and its political principles -- less parochially and more globally.\n\nIt has not, for example, weighed in on the Russia-Ukraine war, and plans to remove all national anthems from its hymnals.\n\nThough the majority of American Latter-day Saints are Republicans, the Utah-based faith maintains strict political neutrality, while declaring that \"some principles compatible with the gospel may be found in various political parties.\"\n\nThe church urges members to \"seek candidates who best embody\" those principles. Members should also study candidates carefully and vote for those who have \"demonstrated integrity, compassion, and service to others, regardless of party affiliation.\"\n\nBYU professor explores faith and politics\n\nRichard Davis, an emeritus Brigham Young University political science professor, set out to discover what that meant to Latter-day Saint politicians.\n\nHe enlisted the aid of several BYU students to interview more than 70 politicians across the globe, the country and Utah, then chose 25 to highlight in his book, \"Faith and Politics: Latter-day Saints Politicians Tell Their Stories.\"\n\nInternational politicians featured in the book include five Euopeans, one Canadian, and one African. U.S. politicians from outside the West included three Republicans and one Democrat, in offices ranging from city council member to congressional representative.\n\nWestern politicians included the late Harry Reid, the five-term U.S. Senator from Nevada who became the highest-ranking elected Latter-day Saint in the nation's history when he captured the title of Senate majority leader.\n\nUtah politicos include Republican Deidre Henderson, Utah's current lieutenant governor, Democrat Brian King, a longtime Utah representative who is now running for governor, and several former federal and state officials.\n\nHow, Davis wondered, did these men and women navigate their faith and their public positions? Should these believers even engage in the world of politics?\n\nIs political involvement anathema to faith?\n\n(Bethany Baker | The Salt Lake Tribune) The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Church Office Building near the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, April 17, 2024.\n\n\"Isn't politics dirty?\" Davis says some members ask. \"Doesn't that mean a church member would have to compromise his or her principles, verbally attack others, or become part of one group or political party that attacks another group?\"\n\nDavis found their answers insightful and even inspiring.\n\n\"These politicians revealed, sometimes quite poignantly,\" he writes in the introduction, \"how they handle the tensions they face in government office while seeking to retain their faith and practice.\"\n\nThe political scientist was moved, he says in an interview, by the politicians' candor about \"the challenges they faced, such as anti-Mormon hostility, gender bias within LDS culture, or personal conflict with other politicians, and how the teachings of the gospel helped them through those challenges.\"\n\nThe book is divided into four parts by geography: international, U.S. outside the West, U.S. inside the West, and Utah.\n\nDavis was seeking an array of political opinions and perspectives, he says, from liberal to conservative, from men and women, from outside the United States to inside the Mountain West and the Beehive State, from the smallest municipal elections to the state and federal levels.\n\nHe especially wanted to highlight the positions of faithful Latter-day Saint Democrats, who are often demonized by the faith's Republican majority, many of whom believe that party is not compatible with the church.\n\nDavis himself was long associated with the Democratic Party as one of its leaders in Utah County, and then later helped found the United Utah Party to \"reach across party lines\" and favor \"moderation rather than extremism.\"\n\nHe showcased in his book the increasing number of Latter-day Saint women who are stepping up politically.\n\nAs a global faith, the church \"is very different than it was 50 or even 20 years ago,\" Davis says, \"when it defended American policies like the Vietnam War or going into Iraq.\"\n\nThe change makes sense for church leaders to watch their rhetoric, he says. \"They can't be in the business of being an American church defending U.S. politics if they are going to send missionaries to countries that don't share those views.\"\n\n'Negative perceptions about Latter-day Saints'\n\n(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints flies dozens of flags from around the globe near the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City.\n\nBeing in a tiny minority in some countries means it can be difficult for a Latter-day Saint to be, say, a European member of Parliament or an African mayor.\n\nThose in Davis' book described the issues they faced, including \"negative perceptions about Latter-day Saints ... and the challenge of representing constituencies where few share their religious affiliation.\"\n\nBut their involvement can also produce \"goodwill toward Latter-day Saints,\" Davis writes, and \"can signal to a broader public that Latter-day Saints are good citizens ...\"\n\nIn general, European Latter-day Saint politicians are more diverse politically, says Ralf Grünke, a German who won a seat on the Nidderau City Council as an independent on the Green Party ballot while also serving as an Latter-day Saint bishop.\n\n\"The political spectrum among Latter-day Saints being active in politics ... is much broader [in Europe] than it is in Utah,\" Grunke says in the book. \"I know Latter-day Saints ... who are active in conservative parties, the Social Democrat Party, the former Community Party, the Free Democrats, the Green Party, my little party, far right, far left, anything back and forth, if at all.\"\n\nGrunke can't cite any research on this issue, but has the impression \"that on continental Europe, church members tend to lean toward the political left.\"\n\nDavis agrees.\n\nEven politicians considered \"conservative\" on that continent, he says, \"are much more liberal than conservatives in the U.S.\"\n\nRunning for office in a male-dominated culture\n\n(Chris Samuels | The Salt Lake Tribune) Aimee Winder Newton delivers remarks after being sworn in for a third term as Salt Lake County Council member at the County Government Center in Salt Lake City, Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2023.\n\nOf the 25 politicians in this book, nine are women -- a higher percentage than Latter-day Saint women who actually serve in public office, Davis notes.\n\nHe purposely \"overrepresented women\" to showcase their perspectives within Utah, the western United States and beyond.\n\n\"It was intended,\" Davis says, \"to offer models for future involvement by Latter-day Saint women.\"\n\nThese women have to work against the perspectives from a male-dominated culture, says Aimee Winder Newton, a Republican who ran for Utah governor in 2020.\n\n\"We grow up seeing mostly male leaders. On Sundays we see men who are sitting up on the stand,\" she says in the book. \"We have a very patriarchal culture, and I don't think a lot of people are used to seeing female leaders.\"\n\nDuring her campaign, Newton received text messages saying, \"Women don't belong in government or the law,\" or, \"You need to be home cooking meals and cleaning your house instead of doing this.\"\n\nShe brushed it off, she says, and focused on policies. Now, Winder Newton sits on the Salt Lake County Council, where the leadership is all women.\n\nHer perspective on faith in politics mirrors other men and women in the book.\n\n\"I have Jesus Christ as my role model on how we should treat people ... I am able to be very empathetic towards other people and put myself in their shoes,\" she says. \"... I also have a desire for unity and peace, and I think that's something that comes from church teachings.\"\n\nChallenges of getting involved\n\n(Briana Scroggins | Special to The Tribune) Former U.S. Rep. Ben McAdams speaks during the Utah Democratic Convention at Cottonwood High School in Murray on Saturday, April 23, 2022.\n\nSeveral of the Latter-day Saint politicians mentioned their two-year missions for the church as a catalyst for their careers in public service.\n\nBen McAdams, a Democratic ex-U.S. representative from Utah and a former Salt Lake County mayor, was concerned about the poverty he saw in Brazil, while Andria Tupola, a Republican member of the Hawaii House of Representatives from 2015 to 2019 and current member of the Honolulu City Council, wanted to fight government corruption that she witnessed in Venezuela.\n\nOthers were asked by friends or mentors to jump into the political arena. However, that is not often the case for those outside Latter-day Saint-dominated areas.\n\n\"There may be no one there to invite them to participate,\" Davis writes, which could \"harm the church's ability to interact with government in these areas.\"\n\nStill, Davis believes Latter-day Saint politicians could play an increasingly crucial role in the worldwide public sphere.\n\n\"It is vital,\" he concludes, that everyone engaged in political activity \"see every other person, whether we agree with them or not, as a child of God.\"\n\nEditor's note * This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.

        "summary": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is shifting its focus from American politics to a more global perspective. Historically, the church has been heavily involved in U.S. politics, endorsing major policies and celebrating America as a divinely favored nation. However, the church now maintains strict political neutrality and encourages members to vote based on principles rather than party affiliation.\n\nRichard Davis, an emeritus professor at Brigham Young University, explores the intersection of faith and politics among Latter-day Saint politicians in his book \"Faith and Politics: Latter-day Saints Politicians Tell Their Stories.\" The book features interviews with 25 politicians from various regions, including Europe, Canada, Africa, and the U.S., highlighting their experiences and challenges in balancing faith with public service.\n\nDavis found that Latter-day Saint politicians face unique challenges such as anti-Mormon hostility, gender bias, and personal conflicts. Despite these obstacles, their faith often guides them in their political roles. The book also emphasizes the increasing political involvement of Latter-day Saint women and the broader political spectrum among European church members compared to their American counterparts.\n\nThe LDS Church's global focus necessitates a more neutral stance on political issues to facilitate missionary work in diverse countries. This shift reflects the church's evolution from a predominantly American institution to a global faith community."

        "body": "Nigel Farage was caught off guard at his latest campaign rally when a banner showing a smiling Vladimir Putin dropped down behind him live on stage.\n\nThe Reform UK leader asked \"who put that up there?\" and said someone at the venue should \"get the sack\" after the poster, planted by campaign group Led By Donkeys, slowly descended from the ceiling while he addressed the audience.\n\nThe banner showed the Russian president smiling and giving a thumbs up, with the message \"I [heart] Nigel\" plastered in bold lettering across the bottom.\n\nIt comes after Mr Farage was accused of \"playing into Putin's hands\" by claiming the West provoked Russia into invading Ukraine.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Panorama, he said that the \"ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union\" gave Mr Putin a reason to justify war.\n\nRishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, accused Mr Farage of appeasing the Russian president, while Boris Johnson, who was the UK premier at the time of the invasion, claimed the Reform leader was spouting \"Kremlin propaganda\" after he doubled down on his comments in an article for The Telegraph.\n\nMr Farage has refused to back down, and last week appeared to accuse the Conservatives of capitalising on the row to distract from their own problems.\n\nThe stunt was carried out on Saturday as the Reform leader delivered a speech at the Columbine Centre in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex.\n\nPosting footage of the incident on social media, Led By Donkeys said: \"We just dropped in on Farage's election rally with a beaming picture of Putin. Nigel was not pleased.\"\n\nIn the video, the banner can be seen slowly descending behind Mr Farage midway through his speech, as he condemns \"the poison that is being taught to our children\", claiming pupils are only being told \"the bad things that we did in our history\".\n\nIt cuts to a clip of the Reform leader pointing at the poster and asking: \"Who put that up there?\"\n\nTo cheers from the crowd, Mr Farage adds: \"Someone at the Columbine Centre needs to get the sack, are we agreed?\"\n\nThe audience then launches a chant of \"rip it down\". Towards the end of the clip, two men on stage begin to tug at the banner, but appear unable to dislodge it.\n\nIn his interview with Nick Robinson for BBC Panorama earlier this month, Mr Farage was asked why he had \"blamed the West\" for Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nHe replied: \"It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union was giving this man a reason to his Russian people to say, 'they're coming for us again' and to go to war.\"\n\nAsked whether his rhetoric was echoing that of the Russian president, he said: \"But, hang on a second, we provoked this war. It's - you know, of course, it's his fault, he's used what we've done as an excuse.\"\n\nIn response, Mr Sunak said: \"What he said was completely wrong and only plays into Putin's hands.\n\n\"This is a man who deployed nerve agents on the streets of Britain, who's doing deals with countries like North Korea. And this kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain's security, the security of our allies that rely on us and only emboldens Putin further.\"\n\nIn his follow-up article for The Telegraph, Mr Farage insisted he had never been \"an apologist or supporter of Putin\", adding: \"His invasion of Ukraine was immoral, outrageous and indefensible.\n\n\"As a champion of national sovereignty, I believe that Putin was entirely wrong to invade the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Nobody can fairly accuse me of being an appeaser. I have never sought to justify Putin's invasion in any way and I'm not now.\"\n\nBut he said: \"That doesn't change the fact that I saw it coming a decade ago, warned that it was coming and am one of the few political figures who has been consistently right and honest about Russia's Ukraine war.\n\n\"What I have been saying for the past 10 years is that the West has played into Putin's hands, giving him the excuse to do what he wanted to do anyway.\"",

This incident follows accusations against Farage of supporting Putin by suggesting that NATO and EU expansion provoked Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and former PM Boris Johnson criticized Farage's comments as dangerous and supportive of Kremlin propaganda. Farage defended his stance, asserting that while he condemns Putin's actions, he believes Western policies have inadvertently empowered the Russian president."

        "title": "American and British Voters Share Deep Roots. In 2024, They Distrust Their Own Leaders, Too",
        "body": "Distrust has settled over the campaign trails in the United States and United Kingdom ahead of July 4 like a soggy summer haze.\n\nOn that day, British voters will choose a new Parliament in an election expected to finish with a Labour government after 14 years under the Conservatives. Americans, polarized by the rematch between Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, will mark Independence Day in something resembling unity with barbecues and fireworks ahead of their vote on Nov. 5.\n\nThere's much to celebrate on the Fourth of July for one of the world's biggest democracies and the venerable kingdom that gave rise to it, 248 years after they split and set off on slow, troubled journeys toward granting all citizens the right to vote. Both remain rooted in the Magna Carta, the English document signed in 1215. It set in writing the idea that leaders -- including kings, presidents and their governments -- are not above the law. The nations have become close friends and stalwart allies.\n\nThat's how it started.\n\nAs for how it's going, the run-up to July 4, 2024 -- Independence Day for one land, Election Day for the other -- offers a snapshot of the stress test facing voters in each country.\n\n\"I'm just very disheartened, really, because I don't think any of the parties know what they're doing,\" Dartford, England, resident Jacqueline Richards, 77, said of her country's election. \"But then looking at yours in America, it's not that great, is it?\"\n\nEvery democratic election is, at its core, about who voters trust to run their country so they can go about running their lives.\n\nDebates are candidate aptitude tests in real time. Thursday's showdown between Biden, 81, and Trump, 77, proved a stark example. Biden's halting performance did the opposite of building confidence, even among some of his supporters. Trump, meanwhile, repeated his lies about the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and his record as president.\n\nThat's only the most recent example of why distrust and resignation dominate the emotional landscape in both countries, according to voters interviewed by The Associated Press in recent weeks. From battleground Wisconsin to bellwether Dartford, voters said years of misinformation, scandal and lies have drained them of the sort of optimism or excitement they might once have felt about the right to vote or the future.\n\nIn Britain, 45% said they \"almost never\" trust governments to put the nation's interest first, up from 34% in 2019, according to a survey published June 12 by the National Centre for Social Research. The pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine War and the country's cost-of-living crisis affected living standards and the economy, it reported. Two Tory prime ministers were ousted. Also, there was Boris Johnson, who resigned rather than be thrown out of Parliament over boozy parties at 10 Downing Street when the nation was under COVID-19 lockdown.\n\n\"They promise and promise and promise and nothing ever changes,\" said Shane Bassett, 34, the bar manager at a pub in Dartford, where the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 is said to have started. \"No matter who gets in -- if it's Labour, if it's Conservative, it's all the same. They all lie.\"\n\nIn the United States, trust has been eroded by deepening political polarization, misinformation and Trump's lies about Biden's victory in the 2020 election -- all amplified by social media.\n\nRoughly 2 in 10 Americans say they trust the U.S. government to do what is right \"just about always\" or \"most of the time,\" according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. About 6 in 10 say they can trust the government \"only some of the time\" and about 2 in 10 say they can never trust the government to do what's right.\n\nNearly three-quarters of American adults blame the news media for dividing the nation, according to a 2023 poll by AP-NORC. Families and friends have learned to avoid discussing politics around Thanksgiving tables and other gatherings. In many places, even celebrations of the Fourth of July -- a national holiday when Americans mark the 1776 ratification of the Declaration of Independence from Britain -- fall under this practice of restraint.\n\nIn Racine, Wisconsin, Rebecca Eisel, 48, wondered how the vast United States, home of 262 million eligible voters and the world's biggest economy, faces a rematch that few Americans wanted.\n\n\"How did our democratic process result in something that the majority of the population doesn't like?\" said Eisel, 48.\n\nThe last time Kathleen Barker, 64, was excited about a candidate, it was Ronald Reagan, who went on to serve two terms in the 1980s and exited office by referring to the country as a \"shining city on a hill.\"\n\n\"You could relate to him,\" she said while walking her dog near the river in Racine. \"He felt like just that average man.\"\n\nNow she says, the \"nasty back and forth\" between Biden and Trump -- who each insist the other is unfit for office -- suggest neither can be trusted to dig into the major problems facing the United States.\n\n\"People are poor. The country is struggling. And this is their focus?\" she said.\n\nEmmanuel McKinstry, a 58-year-old businessperson, voiced similar frustration. The economy, he said while waiting in line to hear Trump speak in Racine, is his top issue. The next morning, McKinstry said he'd still vote for Trump -- with reservations.\n\n\"I'm tired of politicians working for themselves and not really getting down and asking people what we really want,\" McKinstry said. \"We're putting you in office. What are you gonna do for us?\"\n\nIn Britain, the distrust is less personal. It's about scandal -- think Johnson and \"partygate\" -- and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nThat's what concerns Bassett, the manager at the Wat Tyler Pub. You're not supposed to talk about politics in British pubs, he says -- the counterpart, perhaps, of the American reluctance to stir up trouble on the same topic at parties.\n\nBut Bassett looked around at the empty dining room at lunch time. There were no customers to offend. So he let it fly.\n\nThe pub's energy bill last winter jumped from its usual 800 pounds a month (about $1,000) to 1,200 pounds (about $1,500). It has struggled since the Christmas season to bring in customers for a beer. He thinks the owners are likely to sell the place only four years after buying it.\n\n\"I'm not very optimistic,\" he said. \"If I could leave the country, I would.\"",

        "title": "The World Still Needs Habermas",
        "body": "Der Philosoph: Habermas und wir, Philipp Felsch, Propyläen Verlag, 256 pp., €24, February 2024\n\nA new book by Berlin-based cultural historian Philipp Felsch, translated from German simply as The Philosopher with the clever subtitle Habermas and Us, argues that Habermas has always been perfectly in sync with different eras of postwar German political culture. This is a remarkable achievement for someone of his longevity: Habermas turns 95 this year. As Felsch observes, had Michel Foucault lived that long, he could have commented on Donald Trump's presidency; had Hannah Arendt reached that age, she could have extended her reflections on terrorism to 9/11.\n\nIt also makes a confession on the philosopher's part at the end of the book all the more remarkable: Felsch reports that, after adverse reactions to his articles on the Russia-Ukraine war, Habermas feels, for the very first time, as if he no longer understands German public opinion. Has Habermas changed, or is the country changing, turning away from the pacificism and \"post-nationalism\" the philosopher has championed for decades?\n\nIronically, it's Habermas's gift as a writer that often makes it difficult to translate his ideas. Habermas was a freelance journalist before he became an academic, and his public interventions -- always in writing, never on TV or radio -- are stylistically brilliant polemics rich in metaphors. The academic volumes can be hard to translate precisely because suggestive metaphors also do philosophical work.\n\nAmong them is a book originally published in 1962 that, to this day, has sold the most copies of all of Habermas's works. It has an unwieldy title -- The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere -- but its main thesis appears straightforward: Democracy is not just about free and fair elections; it also crucially requires open processes of forming public opinion. In Habermas's stylized account, the 18th century had seen an increasing number of bourgeois readers come together freely to discuss novels in salons and coffeehouses. Eventually, discussions turned to political questions. Whereas monarchs had presented themselves before the people, citizens (at least male and propertied ones) now started to expect states to represent their views and act for them.\n\nIt is often forgotten that Habermas's book tells a story of decline and fall: Capitalism, with its increasing reliance on manipulative advertising techniques, and the rise of a complex administrative state had destroyed a free and open public sphere. Yet, in retrospect, the 1960s would appear to be a golden age of mass media, a point Habermas conceded in a 2022 essay on \"the novel transformation of the public sphere.\" There, he contrasted our era of supposed \"filter bubbles\" and \"post-truth\" with a world characterized by widely respected and economically successful newspapers as well as TV news, around which entire nations could congregate each evening.\n\nAs Felsch notes, the book as well as Habermas's subsequent more philosophical work on communication contained just the right kind of message for a postwar age when West Germans, emerging from the Nazi dictatorship and older traditions of obedience to state authority, began learning how to discuss freely. Like many on the left, Habermas experienced the atmosphere of the early Federal Republic as stultifying: Konrad Adenauer, the rabidly anti-communist chancellor, promised \"no experiments,\" tacitly incorporated former Nazis into the new state, and had little tolerance for a critical press -- let alone critical intellectuals.\n\nToday, the country is characterized by an unusually large number of talk shows on evening TV that receive extensive newspaper commentary the next morning, by public discussion forums that are often subsidized by the state, and by newspapers devoting many columns to weekslong debates among professors. Habermas, contrary to the cliché of a rationalist philosopher of deliberation who would ideally like to make parliaments into seminar rooms, has explicitly called for a public sphere that is \"wild\" and in which all kinds of views can be voiced. At the same time, such forums are meant to function like \"sewage treatment plants,\" filtering out false information as well as plainly anti-democratic views.\n\nHabermas's endorsement of liberal democratic procedures -- often derided by Marxists as merely \"formal democracy\" -- made him hostile to postwar intellectual trends in France, which he suspected of promoting irrationalism and an aestheticized politics that lacked all normative standards. Felsch recounts Habermas and Foucault dining together in Paris in an \"icy atmosphere\" in the early 1980s. Apparently, the only real common topic of conversation was German films: Habermas, Felsch tells us, professed his preference for Alexander Kluge's movies dealing with the German past in a reliably pedagogical manner, while Foucault liked Werner Herzog's celebration of \"ecstatic truth\" in his explorations of Africa and Latin America, with the evidently irrational Klaus Kinski in the lead.\n\nIt is not an accident that Habermas has always been careful not to cultivate anything like a traditional German Geniekult, or cult of the towering genius -- nor that he sometimes serves as Exhibit A for French observers who claim that, compared with Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger, contemporary German philosophy has become thoroughly boring, dominated by what French philosopher Gilles Deleuze called \"bureaucrats of pure reason.\"\n\nBut Felsch, who interviewed the philosopher twice in his modernist bungalow in Bavaria, gets Habermas to reveal something surprising: Every single one of his newspaper articles, Habermas claims, was written out of anger. Indeed, rather than being a bureaucrat of pure reason pedantically administering legacies of the Enlightenment, Habermas is best understood as a thoroughly political animal -- even as a somewhat impulsive man, but with reliable left-liberal political instincts. Beyond a general commitment to dialogue and cooperation, his political vision entails an evolution beyond inherited ideas of ethnic nationalism and toward a cosmopolitan international legal order, each aspect of which is now increasingly under threat.\n\nIn the early 1980s, his political impulses led him to a subject he had previously doubted was \"capable of theory\": history. In 1986, in a polemical piece that provoked one of the most important debates in postwar Germany, he accused four historians of trying to \"normalize\" the German past -- as well as the German present. It was crucial, he wrote, to resist any relativization of the Holocaust by conservatives who supposedly thought the Federal Republic should adopt something like a \"normal\" nationalism. Instead, he suggested, Germans might have learned something special from their uniquely problematic past by adopting what Habermas termed \"constitutional patriotism.\" Rather than being proud of cultural traditions and heroic deeds by great national heroes, Germans had learned to take a critical stance vis-à-vis history, from the vantage point of universal principles enshrined in a liberal democratic constitution.\n\nThis patriotism was often dismissed by conservatives as fit merely for seminar rooms: too abstract and, with a particularly inappropriate metaphor, too \"bloodless.\" Yet there is little doubt that Habermas emerged as the victor in what came to be known as the Historikerstreit, or historians' dispute, and that his suggestion of a \"post-national political culture\" was in fact, if not in name, adopted by ever more German politicians. In the end, Habermas and Adenauer had converged on the same goal: a Germany firmly anchored in the West, except that Habermas began to see it as a possible avant-garde in the move toward a more cosmopolitan future.\n\nThat achievement was put into doubt by the biggest shock to Habermas's political world before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine: the entirely unexpected unification of East and West Germany, overseen by Helmut Kohl, a trained historian who, according to Habermas, had been central to attempts at \"normalizing\" the past. Habermas had been skeptical of unification as long ago as the 1950s, when Social Democrats pushed for overcoming the Cold War division. In 1989, the push for re-creating the German nation-state appeared likely to replace the hard-won achievement of constitutional patriotism with ethnic nationalism.\n\nSubsequently, Habermas became a fervent supporter of European integration. In the late 1970s, he was still saying he was \"not a fan of Europe,\" since what was then called the European Economic Community had been initiated by Christian Democrats such as Adenauer and operated mostly as a common market. But the European Union became a kind of political life insurance policy for those anxious about any post-Cold War resurgence of German nationalism. To the extent that Europe would become a polity, it seemed reasonable to think that the community, with its variety of national cultures, would have to be one held together by abstract political principles -- a European constitutional patriotism of sorts. In the early 2000s, Habermas, together with then-Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of the German Greens, campaigned for a European constitution -- an effort that turned out to be a failure.\n\nHabermas also came to think that Europe's identity could be defined by its commitment to international law -- and as a counterweight in that way to a United States that, after 9/11, appeared to lose its normative bearings. In 2003, he co-wrote a passionate appeal for European unity with Jacques Derrida, an erstwhile philosophical adversary whom Habermas suspected of irrationalism and conservative tendencies, like so many French theorists. Europe was to define itself as law-abiding and humane, on account of its welfare states -- in opposition to George W. Bush's America breaking through the shackles of international law. The hubris of U.S. neoconservatives proved a personal disappointment for an intellectual who had formative stints in the United States ever since first being welcomed to New York by Arendt.\n\nAnother central part of Habermas's proposed European identity was a commitment to pacifism. Felsch argues convincingly that Habermas has remained remarkably consistent in his pacifist instincts: as an opponent of rearming the Bundeswehr in the 1950s, as a critic of the Vietnam War in the '60s, and as an advocate for those blockading sites where nuclear-capable missiles had been stationed in the early 1980s. (Habermas had been the first prominent theorist to justify civil disobedience in a country where law-breaking in the name of moral principles seemed deeply suspect.)\n\nAt the same time, Felsch reminds us that Habermas justified all of Germany's crucial foreign-policy decisions of the post-unification period: its support for the Gulf War, its participation in the intervention in Kosovo, the refusal of the Social Democratic-Green government to join the United States' \"coalition of the willing\" in 2002. For Habermas, a war was justifiable as long as it foreshadowed a cosmopolitan legal order, which left plenty of room for interpretation. (That seemed at least a somewhat plausible account for military action authorized by the United Nations; it was a much harder case to make for NATO's bombing of Belgrade in 1999.)\n\nBut the room for interpretation in Habermas's framework seems not to be able to accommodate the ways that war in Ukraine is now changing political culture in Germany and Europe. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Habermas wrote in the center-left Süddeutsche Zeitung in support of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's cautious approach to supplying military aid. Habermas had always been close to Scholz's Social Democratic Party; its leaders sought his advice, though he would on occasion also pressure them to rethink what he regarded as mistaken policies, such as the diktat of austerity during the European debt crisis. And there had long been a connection between certain factions of the party and the philosopher in their shared affinity for anti-militarism.\n\nYet Habermas's call for negotiations with Moscow in 2023 was widely attacked, including by some on the left. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrii Melnyk tweeted that his interventions constituted a \"disgrace for German philosophy.\" Germany, like much of Europe, had arrived at a new political imperative prompted by Zeitenwende -- Scholz's phrase for the major turning point in history marked by a recommitment to military self-defense. For Habermas, who has always argued that politics should err on the side of seeking peace and mutual understanding, this turn has been impossible to support. By the book's end, Habermas confesses to Felsch that he no longer understands the reactions of the German public.\n\nBut Felsch suggests that if Habermas's legacy is indeed slipping away, it has less to do with the way Habermas has changed than the way the world around him has. Habermas's fears of a more nationalist Germany appear confirmed with a rising far right that flaunts its historical revisionism in ways unimaginable after the Historikerstreit. The EU is hardly a paragon of post-nationalism, its aspirations to be a global \"normative power\" in shambles -- it cannot even get its act together in stopping far-right leaders such as Hungary's Viktor Orban from undermining liberal democracy. The hopes for a cosmopolitan legal order have been dashed in a new age of great-power rivalries. To be sure, Habermas had never committed to anything remotely resembling an end-of-history thesis, but his basic impulse that a world of freundliches Zusammenleben -- friendly coexistence -- was a realistic utopia has certainly been called into question.\n\nYet it would be wrong to conclude that Habermas's thought only made sense in the \"safe space\" of bygone West Germany. The case for something like constitutional patriotism is, if anything, more urgent in the face of a resurgent hard right. The EU is failing in all sorts of ways, but its structures remain available for politically and morally more ambitious undertakings. (Evidently, Habermas has failed to persuade German leaders to take up French President Emmanuel Macron's invitation to build a sovereign Europe.) As disillusioned as Habermas is with the United States -- long the tacit guarantor of his worldview, one is tempted to say -- the best of its universalist founding ideals have hardly been invalidated.\n\nHabermas was never like certain naive liberals of the '90s: History does not simply prove ideas right or wrong; rather, history is an ongoing fight in the wilderness of the public sphere. The task for intellectuals is not to be either optimistic or pessimistic, which was the way for old-style anti-modern thinkers in Germany to prove depth. Instead, it is to be and to stay irritable.",

        "summary": "A new book by Philipp Felsch, titled \"The Philosopher: Habermas and Us,\" explores the enduring relevance of Jürgen Habermas in postwar German political culture. Habermas, who turns 95 this year, has been a significant intellectual figure, advocating for democracy, open public discourse, and a cosmopolitan legal order. Despite his long-standing influence, Habermas recently expressed feeling disconnected from current German public opinion, particularly after his controversial views on the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nFelsch highlights Habermas's consistent pacifism and his critical stance against nationalism, emphasizing his concept of \"constitutional patriotism\" over ethnic nationalism. Habermas's ideas have shaped Germany's postwar identity and its integration into the European Union. However, recent political shifts, including the rise of the far right and changing attitudes towards military defense, challenge his vision.\n\nThe book underscores Habermas's impact on public discourse and his belief in a \"wild\" public sphere where diverse views are expressed and filtered for truth. Despite current challenges, Felsch argues that Habermas's principles remain crucial in combating nationalism and fostering democratic values in today's complex political landscape."

        "body": "DARTFORD, England (AP) -- Distrust has settled over the campaign trails in the United States and United Kingdom ahead of July 4 like a soggy summer haze.\n\nOn that day, British voters will choose a new Parliament in an election expected to finish with a Labour government after 14 years under the Conservatives. Americans, polarized by the rematch between Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, will mark Independence Day in something resembling unity with barbeques and fireworks ahead of their vote on Nov. 5.\n\nThere's much to celebrate on the Fourth of July for the world's biggest democracy and the venerable kingdom that gave rise to it, 248 years after they split and set off on slow, troubled journeys toward granting all citizens the right to vote. Both remain rooted in the Magna Carta, the English document signed in 1215. It set in writing the idea that leaders -- including kings, presidents and their governments -- are not above the law. The nations have become close friends and stalwart allies.\n\n\"I'm just very disheartened, really, because I don't think any of the parties know what they're doing,\" Dartford, England, resident Jacqueline Richards, 77, said of her country's election. \"But then looking at yours in America, it's not that great, is it?\"\n\nEvery democratic election is, at its core, about who voters trust to run their country so they can go about running their lives.\n\nDebates are candidate aptitude tests in real time. Thursday's showdown between Biden, 81, and Trump, 77, proved a stark example. Biden's halting performance did the opposite of building confidence, even among some of his supporters. Trump, meanwhile, repeated his lies about the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and his record as president.\n\nThat's only the most recent example of why distrust and resignation dominate the emotional landscape in both countries, according to voters interviewed by The Associated Press in recent weeks. From battleground Wisconsin to bellwether Dartford, England, voters said years of misinformation, scandal and lies have drained them of the sort of optimism or excitement they might once have felt about the right to vote or the future.\n\nIn Britain, 45% said they \"almost never\" trust governments to put the nation's interest first, up from 34% in 2019, according to a survey published June 12 by the National Centre for Social Research. The pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine War and the country's cost-of-living crisis affected living standards and the economy, it reported. Two Tory prime ministers were ousted. Also, there was Boris Johnson, who resigned rather than be thrown out of Parliament over boozy parties at 10 Downing Street when the nation was under COVID-19 lockdown.\n\n\"They promise and promise and promise and nothing ever changes,\" said Shane Bassett, 34, the bar manager at a pub in bellwether Dartford, England, where the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 is said to have started. \"No matter who gets in -- if it's Labour, if it's Conservative, it's all the same. They all lie.\"\n\nIn the United States, trust has been eroded by deepening political polarization, misinformation and Trump's lies about Biden's victory in the 2020 election -- all amplified by social media.\n\nRoughly 2 in 10 Americans say they trust the U.S. government to do what is right \"just about always\" or \"most of the time,\" according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. About 6 in 10 say they can trust the government \"only some of the time\" and about 2 in 10 say they can never trust the government to do what's right.\n\nNearly three-quarters of American adults blame the news media for dividing the nation, according to a 2023 poll by AP-NORC. Families and friends have learned to avoid discussing politics around Thanksgiving tables and other gatherings. In many places, even celebrations of the Fourth of July -- a national holiday when Americans mark the 1776 ratification of the Declaration of Independence from Britain -- fall under this practice of restraint.\n\nIn Racine, Wis., Rebecca Eisel, 48, wondered how the vast United States, home of 262 million eligible voters and the world's biggest economy, faces a rematch that few Americans wanted.\n\n\"How did our democratic process result in something that the majority of the population doesn't like?\" said Eisel, 48.\n\nThe last time Kathleen Barker, 64, was excited about a candidate, it was Ronald Reagan, who went on to serve two terms in the 1980s and exited office by referring to the country as a \"shining city on a hill.\"\n\n\"You could relate to him,\" she said while walking her dog near the river in Racine. \"He felt like just that average man.\"\n\nNow she says, the \"nasty back and forth\" between Biden and Trump -- who each insist the other is unfit for office -- suggest neither can be trusted to dig into the major problems facing the United States.\n\n\"People are poor. The country is struggling. And this is their focus?\" she said.\n\nEmmanuel McKinstry, a 58-year-old businessperson, voiced similar frustration. The economy, he said while waiting in line to hear Trump speak in Racine, is his top issue. The next morning, McKinstry said he'd still vote for Trump -- with reservations.\n\n\"I'm tired of politicians working for themselves and not really getting down and asking people what we really want,\" McKinstry said. \"We're putting you in office. What are you gonna do for us?\"\n\nIn Britain, the distrust is less personal. It's about scandal -- think Johnson and \"partygate\" -- and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nThat's what concerns Bassett, the manager at the Wat Tyler Pub.

        "body": "DARTFORD, England (AP) -- Distrust has settled over the campaign trails in the United States and United Kingdom ahead of July 4 like a soggy summer haze.\n\nOn that day, British voters will choose a new Parliament in an election expected to finish with a Labour government after 14 years under the Conservatives. Americans across the pond, deeply polarized by the rematch between Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, will mark Independence Day in something resembling unity with barbeques and fireworks ahead of their vote on Nov. 5.\n\nThere's much to celebrate on the Fourth of July for the world's biggest democracy and the venerable kingdom that gave rise to it, 248 years after they split and set off on slow, troubled journeys toward granting all citizens the right to vote. Both remain rooted in the Magna Carta, the English document signed in 1215. It set in writing the idea that leaders -- including kings, presidents and their governments -- are not above the law. The nations have become close friends and stalwart allies.\n\nThat's how it started.\n\nAs for how it's going, the run-up to July 4, 2024 -- Independence Day for one land, Election Day for the other -- offers a snapshot of the stress test facing voters in each country.\n\n\"I'm just very disheartened, really, because I don't think any of the parties know what they're doing,\" Dartford, England, resident Jacqueline Richards, 77, said of her country's election. \"But then looking at yours in America, it's not that great, is it?\"\n\nEvery democratic election is, at its core, about who voters trust to run their country so they can go about running their lives.\n\nDebates are candidate aptitude tests in real time, never more so than during Thursday's showdown between Biden, 81, and Trump, 77. Biden's halting performance did the opposite of building confidence, even among some of his most loyal supporters. Trump, meanwhile, repeated his lies about the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and his record as president.\n\nThat's only the most recent example of why distrust and a sense of resignation dominate the emotional landscape in both countries, according to voters interviewed by The Associated Press in recent weeks. From battleground Wisconsin to bellwether Dartford, England, voters said years of misinformation, scandal and lies have drained them of the sort of optimism or excitement they might once have felt about the right to vote or the future.\n\nIn Britain, 45% said they \"almost never\" trust governments to put the nation's interest first, up from 34% in 2019, according to a survey published June 12 by the National Centre for Social Research. The pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine War and the country's cost-of-living crisis affected living standards and the economy, it reported. Two Tory prime ministers were ousted. Also, there was Boris Johnson, who resigned rather than be thrown out of Parliament over boozy parties at 10 Downing Street when the nation was under COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nA vote to turn the Conservative government out of power is not necessarily a vote for Labour, opposition leader Keir Starmer acknowledged during a May 27 debate. Voters, he said, \"still have questions about us: Has Labour changed enough? Do I trust them with my money, our borders, our security?\"\n\nStarmer's own answer was yes, of course. But British voters told the AP in the weeks before the election that they're far from sure.\n\n\"They promise and promise and promise and nothing ever changes,\" said Shane Bassett, 34, the bar manager at a pub in bellwether Dartford, England, where the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 is said to have started. \"No matter who gets in -- if it's Labour, if it's Conservative, it's all the same. They all lie.\"\n\nIn the United States, trust has been eroded by deepening political polarization, misinformation and Trump's lies about Biden's victory in the 2020 election -- all amplified by social media.\n\nRoughly 2 in 10 Americans say they trust the U.S. government to do what is right \"just about always\" or \"most of the time,\" according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. About 6 in 10 say they can trust the government \"only some of the time\" and about 2 in 10 say they can never trust the government to do what's right.\n\nNearly three-quarters of American adults blame the news media for dividing the nation, according to a 2023 poll by AP-NORC. Families and friends have learned to avoid discussing politics around Thanksgiving tables and other gatherings. In many places, even celebrations of the Fourth of July -- a national holiday when Americans mark the 1776 ratification of the Declaration of Independence from Britain -- fall under this practice of restraint.\n\nIn Racine, Wis., Rebecca Eisel, 48, wondered how the vast United States, home of 262 million eligible voters and the world's biggest economy, faces a rematch that few Americans wanted.\n\n\"How did our democratic process result in something that the majority of the population doesn't like?\" Eisel, 48, said over a sandwich at the Maple Table restaurant.\n\nThe last time Kathleen Barker, 64, was excited about a candidate, it was Ronald Reagan, who went on to serve two terms in the 1980s and exited office by referring to the country as a \"shining city on a hill.\"\n\n\"He was a very real person, very respectful, family-oriented,\" she said while walking her dog near the river in Racine. \"You could relate to him. He felt like just that average man.\"\n\nNow, she says, the \"nasty back-and-forth\" between Biden and Trump -- who each insist the other is unfit for office -- suggest neither can be trusted to dig into the major problems facing the United States.\n\n\"People are poor. The country is struggling. And this is their focus?\" she said.\n\nEmmanuel McKinstry, a 58-year-old businessperson, voiced similar frustration. The economy, he said while waiting in line to hear Trump speak in Racine, is his top issue. The next morning, McKinstry said he'd still vote for Trump -- with reservations.\n\n\"I'm tired of politicians working for themselves and not really getting down and asking people what we really want,\" McKinstry said. \"We're putting you in office. What are you gonna do for us?\"\n\nThe last presidential candidate to excite high school teacher Marcus T. West, 49, was Democrat Barack Obama, who went on to serve two terms.\n\n\"He got the importance of educators. He had good intentions,\" West said over breakfast at Mrs. Betty's Kitchen. \"He's the last person I felt talked like me, talked to me, passed policies that I liked.\"\n\nThis year, he said of Biden and Trump, \"they aren't looking out for us.\"\n\nIn Britain, the distrust is less personal. It's about scandal -- think Johnson and \"partygate\" -- and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nOn May 22, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had good news and a bombshell: Inflation was down to 2.3% for the first time in three years, and he was dissolving Parliament immediately, which started a clock that required an election on July 4.\n\nBut the visuals are what's remembered about that day. Rain soaked his suited shoulders as Sunak spoke where his predecessors had stood for 275 years, before the iconic black door of No. 10 Downing Street. No one sheltered him with an umbrella. Protesters nearly drowned out his words by playing \"Things Can Only Get Better,\" a rival Labour campaign song used in the Tony Blair era.\n\n\"Things can only get wetter,\" led the reports on several news sites.\n\nThat's what concerns Bassett, the manager at the Wat Tyler Pub, named for a leader of the Peasants' Revolt that started on that site. You're not supposed to talk about politics in British pubs, he says -- the counterpart, perhaps, of the American reluctance to stir up trouble on the same topic at parties.\n\nBut Bassett looked around at the empty dining room at lunch time. There were no customers to offend. So he let it fly.\n\nThe pub's energy bill last winter jumped from its usual 800 pounds a month (about $1,000) to 1,200 pounds (about $1,500). It has struggled since the Christmas season to bring in customers for a quality, 4.50 beer. He thinks the owners are likely to sell the place only four years after buying it.\n\n\"I'm not very optimistic.\" he said. Thinking of his family members in Canada, Bassett added: \"If I could leave the country, I would.\"\n\n___\n\nFernando reported from Racine, Wisconsin.

        "body": "France to vote in election that could put far right in government\n\nJohnny Cotton\n\nJune 30, 2024 at 2:04 AM\n\nBy Johnny Cotton\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - French voters cast their ballots on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country's first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls open at 0600 GMT, closing at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, and at 1800 GMT in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her protégé, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare.

        "body": "A woman walks past election boards with a campaign poster of French far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally - RN) party with the faces of RN leader Marine Le Pen and RN President Jordan Bardella on the eve of the first round of the early French parliamentary elections, in Henin-Beaumont, France, June 29, 2024. The slogan reads \"Bardella Prime Minister\". REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - French voters cast their ballots on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country's first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls open at 0600 GMT, closing at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, and at 1800 GMT in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her protégé, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.\n\n(Additional reporting by Paris bureau; Writing by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Frances Kerry)",

        "body": "NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg proposed sanctioning China over its support for Russia amid the Russia-Ukraine war. Unlike the West, China has not directly provided countless aid packages to Russia, but China has kept trade open and exchanged technology with Moscow. Stoltenberg believes China must face \"consequences\" for not aligning with NATO.\n\nThe West is theoretically not at war with Russia or China. NATO is on the offensive, completely stepping over boundaries and harassing foreign nations to instigate World War III. Then they tell the public and mainstream media to announce that they are merely protecting their own people from our enemies who have done absolutely nothing to earn such a title.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nUnder this line of thinking, the NATO alliance could punish anyone who dissents from their global autocratic authority. \"Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences,\" Stoltenberg said at the Wilson Center in Washington. He honed in on China trading microelectronics with Russia that has improved Russia's satellite proficiencies. China and Russia have agreed to an open partnership, yet China is not involved in this war.\n\nShould NATO also punish India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and others for continuing to trade with Russia? NATO has absolutely no authority to demand that other nations shun Russia from the global economy. They know that these proposed sanctions would not deter China from conducting business with Russia. Instead, these \"consequences\" will cause China and all other non-NATO nations to back away from trading with the West entirely. Will they do the same to nations who continue to trade with China once they redirect their focus to Taiwan? Will they force \"consequences\" upon nations who do not support Israel?\n\nThe Neocons are decimating the economies of western nations by deterring trade. There is no common sense in the boardrooms as the only objective is to fan the flames of war by any means necessary. China already stepped away from Western trade in a major way and now they are actively provoking China to take retaliatory measures.\n\nNATO has zero reason to back Ukraine on paper as it is not a member. They do not plan to offer Ukraine membership at the upcoming Washington summit, but Stoltenberg said they will place the framework to \"build a bridge\" to future membership. Stoltenberg congratulated NATO members for contributing more to the alliance this year than ever before. This global force is a danger to civilization itself as it aims to propel us into a global conflict from which there will be no turning back.",

        "body": "Joe Biden, in this week's presidential debate with President Donald Trump, revealed himself as unfocused, uncomprehending, unable to express his thoughts, unable to track a line of argument, unable to remember facts, and unwilling to step aside.\n\nHe also did something else: Made the world a lot less safe.\n\nIt is John Daniel Davidson, who wrote at The Federalist of the new, enhanced threat.\n\nHe said while the \"chatter\" was all about what the Democrats will do for a 2024 candidate, \"now that the president has shown himself to be unfit for office,\" there's another issue.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\n\"An important point has gone largely unnoticed: America essentially has no president right now. Whomever is calling the shots in the White House, especially on foreign affairs, it isn't Biden. While it's true that much of American governance has devolved into the hands of an unelected (and unaccountable) administrative bureaucracy, when it comes to foreign policy and decisions about how to respond to crises overseas, the president still plays an important and arguably indispensable role,\" Davidson explained.\n\nHowever, he noted, \"Our current president, as the entire world now knows, cannot follow the train of his own thoughts. He seems to have only a tenuous grasp on reality. He can barely walk down a few steps. Clearly, he's not the one in charge of the White House, which means the presidency itself is remarkably weak right now. That in turn means the world is a much more dangerous place after last night, because America's adversaries know they have a narrow window to exploit the obvious weakness of our executive branch while Biden is still in office.\"\n\nThe danger, then, he explained, isn't what \"fallout\" there might be from the debate. \"It might be actual fallout.\"\n\nHe explained, \"Right now there are multiple hot conflicts around the world -- and not just low-level coups in small countries like Bolivia and Kenya. Israel is essentially at war with Iran. The Russia-Ukraine war rages on, no end in sight. And China could launch an invasion of Taiwan any day. These are dangerous times even without a dementia-addled 81-year-old in the White House. But the extent of Biden's decline has made it even more dangerous.\n\n\"To be clear, Biden has been unfit for office for years at this point. But the public spectacle of the debate gave a new urgency to a reality that our establishment media and political classes have been denying for a while now. Simply put, the debate made it undeniable that Biden is in a state of rapid decline. He can barely string a sentence together or keep track of what he's talking about. There is no way to spin it. The entire world saw the reality of our situation last night.\"\n\nIn contrast, he explained, was Trump.\n\n\"Cogent, forceful, and clear-eyed about the threats we face abroad and what he'll do about them,\" Davidson explained.\n\nIt was former deputy national security adviser for Trump K.T. McFarland who brought up the point that Iran, China and Russia, and others, \"realize they have a harrowing window of opportunity to exploit U.S. weakness.\"\n\nAlso there are key differences in the foreign policies pursued by Trump and Biden. Under Trump, Moscow didn't attack Ukraine and there was peace in the Middle East. Not so under Biden.\n\nThe differences, he said, are noted by \"our adversaries.\"\n\n\"They know it will be much harder to pursue their strategic aims during a second Trump administration for the simple reason that Trump's foreign policy is guided by nationalism in a way that Biden's is not,\" he said.\n\nAfter the debate, he warned, \"the entire world knows we don't have a competent commander in chief. We don't even have a president.\"\n\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

These attacks, which included mass phishing and a massive DDoS attack, disrupted local internet services, accounting systems, and cash registers in Kerch and Sevastopol. The cyber offensive also affected the call center of the occupying administration in Sevastopol. As a result, significant traffic jams formed on the Kerch Bridge, with around 300 cars queued by morning."

        "title": "The Democrats are panicking: Biden could bring the whole party down",
        "body": "The stunning results of Thursday's presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump are reverberating around the United States, with the full consequences yet unseen. At the moment, Democrats are seriously considering, finally, whether to dump Biden as their prospective presidential nominee. Without drastic, nearly unprecedented action now, they may be on the way not only to losing the White House, but to significant losses in Senate, House, state and local races as well. Without the incentive to turn out, many Democratic voters might simply stay at home, with enormous down-ballot consequences.\n\nTrump had less at stake in the debate because opinions about him, pro and con, are well-established and hard to change. Biden is equally well-known, but nagging doubts about his mental acuity meant he had enormous downside risk if the debate aggravated those doubts. That is precisely what happened. Trump was no altar boy, just his usual boastful, bragging, prevaricating self, but Biden's performance panicked his fellow Democrats. How many will want to risk jumping off the cliff with him leading their ticket?\n\nThese potentially tectonic political consequences overshadowed the substantive debate, especially on national security issues. Repeatedly, however, Trump took positions that would be seriously wrong if implemented as policy. Biden attempted to defend his record, which needs a lot of defending, leaving the queasy feeling that neither man is really fit to be president.\n\nTake Afghanistan. In the debate's opening minutes, the two candidates tangled on the issue, with both ducking responsibility for US withdrawal. Biden said he was this century's only president without Americans in combat overseas, and criticised Trump for having US forces \"still killing people in Afghanistan\" on his watch. In fact, withdrawal was a joint Trump-Biden effort: Trump negotiated surrendering Afghanistan to the Taliban, and Biden implemented it. There is plenty of blame for both. Trump rightly slammed Biden's 2021 implementation of the departure, exemplified by the debacle at Kabul airport, saying, \"no general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country...\" Overstated, but not by much.\n\nTrump admitted he also wanted out, but claimed \"we were getting out with dignity, with strength, with power\". This typical Trump bluster saw action throughout the evening. He also repeatedly attacked Biden for his international image, asserting \"we're no longer respected as a country. They don't respect our leadership.\"\n\nClaiming Biden was weak didn't deter Trump from also calling him a warmonger: \"These are wars that will never end with him. He will drive us into World War Three and we're closer to World War Three than anybody can imagine... President Xi of China, Kim Jong Un of North Korea, all of these - Putin - they don't respect him. They don't fear him.\" In Trump's surreal world, all of this makes sense.\n\nInterestingly, China was lightly discussed, but Trump raised it first during the Afghanistan discussion. He rejected the idea that his proposed 10 per cent across-the-board tariffs will increase US consumer prices, saying it would force countries like China \"that have been ripping us off for years ... to pay us a lot of money ... and give us a lot of power for other things\". Trump currently talks tough on Beijing because he believes the Covid pandemic, originating in China, cost him the 2020 election. How long this would last if Xi paid him a post-election congratulatory call is unknowable.\n\nUsing China as a hook to offset his recent felony convictions, Trump assaulted Biden's behaviour, portraying him as a criminal. Trump absurdly said Biden \"gets paid by China. He's a Manchurian Candidate,\" which apparently \"explains\" why Biden is afraid to take tough stands against Xi. Unsurprisingly, the debate produced immediate concern among Asian observers, who saw it live Friday morning their time.\n\nOn Ukraine, Trump continued claiming that, had he been president, Russia never would have invaded (again unprovable but also irrefutable). He pledged to resolve the Russia-Ukraine war as president-elect, even before being inaugurated next January 20.\n\nBiden defended his record, and Trump complained endlessly about how much money the United States had spent on Ukraine compared to Europe, which always strikes a chord with Trump's base, along with his familiar complaints about Nato spending levels.\n\nTurning to the Middle East, Trump, on cue, asserted that Hamas would not have attacked Israel had he been president. He argued that anti-Iran sanctions imposed after the US withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018 had essentially broken Iran financially. Sadly, that claim is far from reality. Certainly, Biden's relaxation of sanctions enforcement has allowed Iran's international oil sales to rebound significantly, but Iran was still funding terrorism and nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes during Trump's term.\n\nNever missing an opportunity for personal insult, Trump said Biden should \"let [Israel] finish the job. He doesn't want to do it. He's become like a Palestinian.\" Really.\n\nThe coming days will determine whether Biden survives as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Even if he does, however, it is harder than before to deny he is in serious, potentially fatal political trouble - and at a time when the free world has rarely been in greater need of effective leadership.",

        "title": "As DeSantis cuts arts funding, tax revenues will go down, tourists will stay away | Letters",
        "body": "Gov. DeSantis has eviscerated funding for the arts and culture in one uncaring slash. Studies have shown that for every $1 spent on arts and culture programs, $9 more in related spending is generated. Restaurants, hotels and businesses are the beneficiaries of Florida Rep's location in Fort Myers' River District. Tax revenues will go down, tourists will stay away, many jobs will be lost, and some nonprofit organizations will be forced to close.\n\nThe Tony-winning playwright of \"Stereophonic\" recently said, \"It's really hard to make a career in the arts, we need to fund the arts in America. It is the hallmark of a civilized society.\"\n\nDeSantis' veto of all arts funding for Naples and Bonita reveals the level of degradation of this man. Three quotes from your reporter's article verify it well.\n\n\"This veto is not just a budgetary decision. It is a blatant disregard for thousands of jobs, the educational opportunities and the community enrichment that arts and culture provide.\"\n\n\"Funding arts and culture is not a handout. It's an investment in the economic future of a community.\"\n\n\"This is not just about numbers on a balance sheet. It's about real people - artists, educators, families, and audiences - who rely on these funds to create and experience the transformative power of the arts. Gov. DeSantis' decision is an outright betrayal of the values that uphold our society, and it is a disservice to every Floridian who believes in the importance of culture, creativity and community.\"\n\nGovernor DeSantis, you could be the hero of our communities if you reversed your decision to cancel funds for the various projects that create entertainment for folks and development of artists. We, as taxpayers benefit hugely from having our money help support the arts.\n\nRe: Arts groups stunned after DeSantis slashes $32M. Why is anyone surprised, let alone stunned? Most, although not all Republican politicians are solely interested in their wealthy cohorts. The fact that this veto will impact thousands of \"artists\" does not concern our governor. If you keep voting this way, for these people, our quality of life will continue to change for the worse. We've seen it in our environment, our cultural institutions, our educational systems, and our societal mores.\n\nCan't you hear the chip, chip, chip eating away at what once was?\n\nIn January of 2024, Bloomberg Foundation designated funding $250 million for health high schools as a partnership between public schools and local hospitals as the first step in educating students for health care careers or foundational for continuing education to licensed positions. The Lee County Medicare age population is percentage-wise larger than the national average, exacerbating the health care workforce shortage.\n\nThe Lee County Commission as part of considering approval of Lee Health, a public hospital conversion to not-for-profit status could conditionally stipulate Lee Health in conjunction with Lee County Public Schools establish a formal health high school on the campus of a Lee Health facility akin to the Bloomberg model.\n\nWhat a mess! Based on Thursday's \"Debate,\" our options for the next president are either a slow old man or a pathological liar with no morals. We can thank both the Republican and Democratic parties and our inept congressional leaders for this mess.\n\nWhile I am disappointed in the recent presidential debate, I did notice that every time a direct question was asked of Trump in regard to his policy or past actions he changed the topic and avoided answering. His responses were mostly canned lies from his rallies. He denied what Americans saw and heard with their own eyes. So many of his statements were in reference to events we watched on the news - we saw the nazi rally in Charlottesville and heard Trump call both \"many fine people.\" He denied calling military personnel \"suckers and losers\" and instead called General Kelly a liar. We watched in horror at the 1/6 attacks and prayed repeatedly for Trump to come make a statement against it, yet he claimed once again it was Pelosi's fault. He didn't answer when asked if he condemned those who stormed the Capitol and complained that the rioters had their jobs ruined because they were punished for committing those acts! Most importantly, he refused to say he would abide by the next election results. And, he was proud to take away a woman's right to choice and claimed abortions happen for 2-3 days after birth! A ridiculous statement.\n\nThe lies were coming fast and furious and Biden, who was apparently dealing with a cold, couldn't respond forcefully enough. His cold made him sound weak as he tried to rebut some lies while also calmly presenting some of his policy accomplishments.\n\nOn actually answering questions on policy Trump failed. On giving honest answers and offering substance, Biden won. Many pundits will judge based on perceptions, but the substance given in Biden's answers is what matters most. I'll take honesty over showmanship anytime.\n\nI know there will be a lot of discussion about the debate. Biden did this or Trump lied about that. But this misses the bigger picture and I hope people will realize it. When the Hur report came out and said Biden will come across as an old man with a poor memory and therefore won't be prosecuted, the Democrats and the administration insisted he was alert and spry behind closed doors. Many people have been saying for years that Biden is not fit to be in charge of the nuclear codes so it shouldn't be news to anyone in DC. But all the discussion about the debate, Biden, Trump, etc. misses the point. The Democrat Party and the Biden White House have attempted to pull of the biggest charade in American political history by putting a cognitively compromised person in office and lying about it. Although people have their suspicions, no one actually knows who is in really in charge of the country. Even if Biden steps aside, the Democrat Party should never be trusted to hold power again. If EVER there was a threat to democracy.\n\nFor the past three and one-half years we have witnessed the physical and mental decline of Joe Biden. We know what we see and hear. Almost everyone has an aging parent, friend, or relative that has suffered a similar decline. It's not funny. It's sad. Most recently his spokespersons claimed that what we were seeing and hearing were some type of artificial intelligence and diabolical \"cheap fakes.\" I assume that what we all witnessed and heard in this most recent presidential debate will put an end to any such speculation. Hopefully Mr. Biden can get the help he needs.John Mcwilliams, Fort Myers\n\nTrove of wisdom\n\nThe effects of aging aren't superficially attractive, especially to our ageist culture.But wisdom acquired by empaths, like Biden, from multiple decades of life's experiences are treasure troves of brilliant jewels inside tattered and time-worn chests.To reject or disregard the treasures inside time-worn chests is the epitome of foolishness.\n\nCongressman Byron Donalds embarrassed himself and all of us, his constituents, in an interview on BBC America prior to the presidential debate on June 27. Give him credit for memorizing all the MAGA talking points, but what a pack of lies! The most offensive, in this writer's mind, was the lie that Trump was not made aware of the charges against him in the recent fraud trial and that Manhattan AG Alvin Bragg was somehow in cahoots with the Biden campaign. Shockingly ignorant of state vs federal laws!\n\nSo, when did the Republican Party, long entrenched in law and order, become so anti-law and order?When Donald Trump and his consiglieres, capos and street thugs came to power, that's when.House Republicans want convicted criminal Steve Bannon's prison sentence dropped.Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson agrees with Trump's plan to pardon all the thugs who beat hell out of Capitol cops.Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he supports criminal Trump's run for president.Convicted Criminal-in-Chief Trump himself has said he'll jail the prosecutors who convicted him if he's elected.Trump's congressional Cosa Nostra relishes law and order when paddy wagons fill with Blacks and immigrants but not when their white armies of the night are taking the ride.They're the worst of hypocrites, bigots feeding at our public trough and writing our laws.\n\nIn the past decade, we have witnessed the social collapse of many countries, including my own, Venezuela, and the rise of autocratic regimes. This has coincided with dysfunctional governments led by opportunistic populist leaders seeking power, which has caused distrust among populations and our governments. This distrust has led to weakened institutions that are corrupt and unable to govern effectively, exacerbating the gap between governments and the people they are supposed to serve.To address this catastrophic trend of chaos, we need to reconnect with the principle that governments are for the people and by the people, rooting these efforts in civic engagement and public participation. We must work with governments at all levels, collaborating where we can instead of fighting or blaming each other. It starts by humanizing every person, regardless of their background. When there is a lack of respect, there can be no trust, and effective collaboration relies on trust, even amidst disagreements.We have seen the consequences of losing respect for our governments, manifested in violent attacks on parliaments and even the U.S. Capitol in 2021. So, how do we begin to repair this? We start by dropping our biases, stereotypes, and preconceptions, and by seeking to understand others' interests, which is key to mutual gain negotiations. We must talk to each other rather than at each other. Listening is a powerful tool, and treating every personal interaction with respect, empathy, kindness, and compassion is essential. By starting with ourselves and becoming better, more engaged community members, we can improve our lives and the lives of those around us.Participating in democracy means getting politically involved, running for office, being part of an interest group advocating for a cause and working with your representatives. There are many ways you can help ensure that government is truly for the people, by the people, our people.\n\nIt appears to me that all the liberal mailbag writers are going to continue their vile letters about Trump and the Republican Party up until November 5. I don't think they are going to change anyone's mind on who to vote for. Biden has created such a mess of his domestic and international politics that our country is going to have a hard time recovering from. The biggest issue is his open border policy and that alone will cost him the election.\n\nFormer President Trump has repeatedly declared that he has an undisclosed plan to end the Russia-Ukraine War in \"24 hours.\" With the deaths, devastation, and billions of dollars being expended on the conflict, it would seem incumbent upon him, as a public service, to reveal his plan so that, if it is viable, it can be implemented to resolve that matter in a day.One would think that Republicans in Congress, reluctant to expend funds to help Ukraine as well as MAGA adherents and America Firsters who do not support the aid would urge the ex-president to disclose his plan to suit their desires.The last presidential candidate to foist a secret plan like this was another master of mendacity: Richard Nixon. In 1968, he promoted his \"I've got a secret\" concerning the War in Vietnam. After he was elected, the secret was out: there was no plan and the war grinded on for another seven years at the expense of countless lives and funds.Those who would fall for the former president's secret plan ought to recall that old saying: Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\"It would be a shame if this scam works again.\n\nIt's time for our nation to have a real discussion of the value of birthright citizenship.The idea that foreigners coming into the United States are guaranteed the right to have birthright citizenship granted to their children born here is an old-fashioned idea. The rest of the world has either restrictive birthright or completely refuses to recognize birthright citizenship in their country.One might ask why is this a problem? The answer is it leads to dual citizenship which is conferred on their newborn children. This is not a natural extension of any nation's goals is to have dual citizenship of two nations.We should not have folks with dual interests within the U.S. using their birthright in the U.S. to have the ability to push their parents' homeland interests and values on us. We should be a melting pot that can be achieved through restrictive birthright.An example would be when a person born here and lives here from foreign parents matures, at 18 years of age, that person would be able to choose to become a U.S. citizen. Or the simplest way is for the parents to become citizens of the U.S. and give up their homeland citizenship and then have their children.We should not have two classes of citizenship in the U.S. One for those born here by U.S. parents and another birthright class that enjoys the benefits of the U.S. citizenship and a citizenship in another country.\n\nDoes Israel have a right to exist as a safe haven for Jews or should they go back to \"where they came from\" and deal with the massive spike in antisemitism? Are Jews safe outside of Israel? If not, then we agree that Jews need a safe place to live. Or do you think Jews don't have a right to exist? If so, own it. Say it loud and clear and stop hiding behind anti Zionism.If you have hostages locked up in your home, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get. If you are aware of hostages being held in your neighborhood and you say nothing, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.If you invaded a country, killed innocent people, raped women, and abducted others, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.If you fire on soldiers as they extract innocent hostages, whether you're wearing a uniform or civilian clothing, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.If you hide weapons in your children's rooms or allow terror tunnels to be dug in your vicinity and you say/do nothing, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.If you voted for a terrorist organization to govern you, and I don't care what excuses you have, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.If you have any info on the whereabouts of innocent hostages and you don't disclose that info, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.And finally, if you openly stand with a terrorist organization and against those who try to eliminate the terrorists, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.",

        "title": "Pabloite NPA backs pro-war New Popular Front in French snap elections",
        "body": "facebook icon\n\nBy joining the New Popular Front formed by Jean-Luc Mélenchon's France Unbowed party and the big-business Socialist Party (PS) after President Emmanuel Macron's calling of snap elections for July 7, the New Anti-capitalist Party (NPA) has again exposed itself as a tool of imperialism. It is pushing the workers behind the political trap set by Mélenchon and former PS President François Hollande, who aim to intensify war with Russia abroad and class war at home.\n\nThe NPA justifies its support this for alliance, arguing it will build left unity against the danger of the neo-fascist National Rally (RN) coming to power. The RN now has growing support in the ruling class, particularly in the faction of the The Republicans (LR) party around Eric Ciotti that calls for alliances with the RN. The NPA states:\n\n\"At this time, as the RN and its allies are in a position to take power, the Popular Front is giving hope for the social and political left, against neo-liberal reforms, for the antiracist, ecological, feminist, LGBTI struggles and for all movements for the equality of rights. ...\n\n\"The victory against the far right and Macron is only possible on condition of a large mobilization of the population, notably in workplaces, popular neighborhoods and youth. The trade union movement, the environmental struggles, the feminist movement, the movement of solidarity with Palestine, the decolonial and antiracist struggles, must profoundly nourish the program of the Popular Front. They must constitute its living force.\"\n\nBut the New Popular Front is not a great hope for the left. By supporting it, the NPA is joining in the right-wing restucturing of the ruling establishment that Macron aims to carry out via the snap elections. Macron called his snap elections for July 7, shortly after British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called snap elections for July 4, to prepare the ruling establishment for a massive escalation of the war against Russia and of the class war at home.\n\nThe newly-elected British and French governments will send officials to the July 9 NATO summit in Washington that is preparing to send troops to Ukraine for war with Russia -- a policy that Macron has repeatedly advocated. NATO's war calendar is in fact dictating the election calendar in France and Britain, as well as the NPA's political maneuvers.\n\nThe NPA's claim that the New Popular Front is nourished by anti-colonial struggles is a political lie. It is an alliance with forces like Hollande, an undisguised enemy of the working class who brutally repressed social protests at home while waging neocolonial wars from Syria to Mali. The New Popular Front's program calls to build up the French military police and intelligence services and to send troops to Ukraine, ostensibly as \"peacekeepers.\"\n\nThe New Popular Front is not the Popular Front of 1934-1938. The Popular Front was not, it must be said, an anti-colonial force. It was an alliance of Stalinist and social-democratic parties with the liberal bourgeois Radical party. The price of the alliance with the Radicals was not only to renounce socialist revolution, but also to acquiesce in France's rule over its then-vast colonial empire, stretching from Indochina to Syria and Algeria. The Popular Front was, nonetheless, far to the left of the New Popular Front.\n\nToday's New Popular Front, unlike its predecessor in the 1930s, does not contain any party with a mass base in the working class and does not even have the pretense of proposing major social reforms like the 8-hour day or paid vacations. It is a pro-war alliance that, if it formed a government under a Macron presidency, would slash workers' living standards to arm and prepare France for \"high-intensity warfare\" with Russia.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Trotskyist movement could enter into the mass working class base of the French social democracy to openly carry out political work opposing imperialism, colonialism and capitalism.\n\nThe NPA's decision to join the New Popular Front today testifies to its deep-rooted hostility to Trotkyism. It is joining an alliance with the PS, a big business party founded in 1971 and that since then has been one of French imperialism's main parties of rule.\n\nThe PS lead candidate in this month's European elections, Raphaël Glucksmann, publicly denied the genocide in Gaza and called to arm Ukraine against Russia. Indeed, the PS is at the heart of imperialist war intrigue in Ukraine. Under Hollande, for whom Macron was economy minister, the PS worked with Washington and Berlin to topple pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich in a far right coup that triggered a conflict in Ukraine that now is rapidly escalating to nuclear war.\n\nThe NPA's emergence in an open alliance with the PS is the outcome of its support, ever since its foundation in 2009 based on an explicit rejection of Trotskyism, for the military adventures of French imperialism and NATO. It backed wars in Libya, Syria and Mali and also the 2014 putsch in Ukraine. Shortly after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war two years ago, NPA leader Olivier Besancenot went to Ukraine. On his return to France, he promoted NATO's arming of the Ukrainian regime and financial sanctions against Russia as anti-fascist resistance, declaring:\n\n\"We understand that Ukrainians are demanding weapons deliveries, especially defensive weapons that allow to have control of the skies. Those with whom we spoke over there stress that they do not plan for forces other than theirs to substitute themselves for the Ukrainian resistance. On the question of economic sanctions, we are fighting for sanctions against the oligarchs, but we are still falling far short. In Britain, in Cyprus, we are at only 1 percent of what could be done.\"\n\nThis brief for war with Russia is a pack of lies that exposes the anti-fascist pretenses of the NPA and the entire New Popular Front. The Ukrainian regime is not a democratic, anti-fascist regime but a far-right dictatorship. Its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has suspended elections and rules based on a network of intelligence agencies and far-right militias led by operatives loyal to the memory of the Ukrainian Nazi-collaborationist Stepan Bandera.\n\nAgainst the NPA's utterly fraudulent presentation of their Ukrainian war policy as a \"hope for the left,\" workers and youth can only orient themselves by turning to the history of the great struggles of the Trotskyist movement. A class gulf separates Pabloite support for NATO wars from the International Committee of the Fourth International's (ICFI) Trotskyist opposition to both NATO imperialism and the post-Soviet Russian capitalist regime.\n\nPabloism emerged in an international split with the ICFI, the defenders of the continuity of Trotskyism, in 1953. Michel Pablo and Ernest Mandel rejected the Marxist conception of the working class as an independent revolutionary force and called on the Trotskyist movement to liquidate itself into Stalinist, social-democratic or bourgeois nationalist movements. After the 1991 dissolution of the USSR by the Stalinist bureaucracy, which the Pabloites had previously promoted as revolutionary, it oriented to support for imperialist war, in line with the interests of their affluent middle class base.\n\nThe NPA's evolution since its founding in 2009 -- during which the Pabloites publicly liquidated its predecessor, the Ligue communiste révolutionnaire -- has confirmed the assessment made by the ICFI at the time on the WSWS. In 2009, it explained:\n\nThe LCR's real target in liquidating itself is, in fact, Trotsky's political heritage: an insistence on the complete political independence of the working class, revolutionary internationalism, and an irreconcilable opposition to collaboration with the bourgeois state, the Stalinist and social-democratic bureaucracies, and all brands of bourgeois nationalism and petty-bourgeois radicalism.\n\nThe LCR's selection of anti-capitalism as its guiding ideology is, in the context of European and especially French politics, a colossal step backwards and to the right, towards the cheapest coin of the realm. Politically indistinct, it embraces all manners of social discontent, regardless of class basis or orientation. It is a term that can be embraced in large sections of the petty-bourgeoisie, both left and right -- everything from the anarchism proposed by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in the mid-19th century to the violent right-populist protests of Pierre Poujade of the mid-20th.\n\nThe escalation of NATO and Macron against Russia will provoke explosive mass opposition. After polls in February showed 68 of French people opposed Macron's call to send troops to Ukraine, a Eurasia Group poll showed 88 percent of Western Europeans oppose escalation and want a negotiated settlement of the Ukraine war. But these events are an urgent warning. A movement against war and dictatorship can only be built from below, mobilizing rank and file workers independently of labor bureaucracies tied to pseudo-left parties like the NPA.\n\nThe political basis of such a movement is a struggle for Trotskyism against Stalinism and the New Popular Front. This requires above all building the Parti de l'égalité socialiste (PES), the French section of the ICFI, as the Trotskyist opposition to the New Popular Front and the NPA. Just as there can be no socialism without democracy, there will not be democracy without a Trotskyist struggle by workers in France and internationally for socialism.\n\nRead moreHow the French New Popular Front strengthens the far right26 June 2024NPA attacks \"leftist\" opposition to French union bureaucracy's talks with Macron2 April 2023French section of IMT backs pro-war New Popular Front in snap elections27 June 2024Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:FranceEuropeThe Politics of the Pseudo-Left",

        "body": "Former President Donald Trump speaks to a crowd over 1,000 people at a June 28 rally in Chesapeake, Virginia. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)\n\nCHESAPEAKE -- \"We win Virginia, and the race is over,\" former president Donald Trump told a crowd of more than a thousand at Historic Greenbrier Farms in Chesapeake on Friday.\n\nHe and opponent President Joe Biden each held rallies following their debate the night before. Biden held one in Raleigh, North Carolina earlier in the day.\n\nIn a roughly hour and a half-long speech, Trump took several victory laps for not entering America into new wars and pressing Congress to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 during his first term.\n\nTrump made several factually inaccurate statements during his remarks. One example was his false claim that in 2020, protesters in Portland, Seattle and Minneapolis were \"ripping people apart and killing people\" during demonstrations that roiled the nation after a Black man, George Floyd, was killed by a white police officer.\n\nWith border security still a key issue for Trump in this election, he alleged without proof that other countries are releasing droves of people from prisons and mental institutions to come into America.\n\nBefore the former president took the stage, the gathering had a county fair vibe, but Trump-themed. Attendees milled about, perused Trump merchandise, and visited food trucks in a large field on Historic Greenbrier Farms.\n\nChesapeake resident Renee Cobb said she's not been particularly pleased by either presidential candidate and that this presidential election feels like picking between the \"lesser of two-evils.\"\n\nPolicy-wise, she gravitates Republican, so attending the rally was a way for her to hear directly from Trump more about his plans should he be elected.\n\n\"He really skirted a lot of questions that I would have been interested in,\" Cobb said of the debate the night prior.\n\nCobb described the debate as a \"s -- show\" for both candidates, though she thinks it went worse for Biden. The president, age 81, spoke in a voice that was often soft and raspy, stumbled over his words at points, and appeared to lose his train of thought a few times. A June Gallup poll found the American voters surveyed \"are nearly twice as likely to say Biden is too old to be president (67%) as say this about Trump (37%).\"\n\n\"My biggest thing from the debate last night was that the Democrats are even saying Biden isn't fit,\" Cobb said.\n\nTrump played into those impressions throughout his speech Friday, taking jabs at Biden and often calling him \"Crooked Biden\" and \"Sleepy Biden.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rich Vanderford's vote for Trump has never been in question. The North Carolina resident drove to Chesapeake on Friday to attend the Trump rally.\n\nHe said that he's been frustrated with the rising cost of living and inflation in recent years and hopes that Trump will be able to help alleviate that. He also supports Trump's plans for tighter U.S.-Mexico border security and the former president's more assertive stance when engaging with foreign governments.\n\n\"I feel like World War III is right around the corner,\" he said of international conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war and tensions between Israel and Hamas, which governs Gaza in the West Bank.\n\nTrump mentioned that he's the only \"competent\" candidate that can prevent that, saying he wants America to have defense systems similar to Israel's dome.\n\nSpeakers at the event included Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, GOP U.S. Senate nominee Hung Cao, former Republican governors Bob McDonnell and George Allen and U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, who represents the second congressional district.\n\nYoungkin, who endorsed Trump in March, said \"Joe Biden's path to retirement runs through Hampton Roads.\"\n\nKiggans' race against Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal could likely be close by November, as the Virginia Beach-anchored district often oscillates between partisan control.\n\n\"What we saw last night was elder abuse,\" Kiggans said Friday afternoon of Biden's performance in the presidential debate.\n\nSmasal's campaign is buffeted by investments from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and potential next Speaker of the House, Hakeem Jeffries, has endorsed her.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Virginia organized a nearby gathering earlier in the day that was supposed to support Smasal's campaign, but she pulled out at the last minute. The event, featuring military veterans and DPVA chair Susan Swecker, was designed to put Trump on blast for past comments referring to military members killed in action as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\"",

        "body": "Joe Biden, in this week's presidential debate with President Donald Trump, revealed himself as unfocused, uncomprehending, unable to express his thoughts, unable to track a line of argument, unable to remember facts, and unwilling to step aside.\n\nHe also did something else: Made the world a lot less safe.\n\nIt is John Daniel Davidson, who wrote at The Federalist of the new, enhanced threat.\n\nHe said while the \"chatter\" was all about what the Democrats will do for a 2024 candidate, \"now that the president has shown himself to be unfit for office,\" there's another issue.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\n\"An important point has gone largely unnoticed: America essentially has no president right now. Whomever is calling the shots in the White House, especially on foreign affairs, it isn't Biden. While it's true that much of American governance has devolved into the hands of an unelected (and unaccountable) administrative bureaucracy, when it comes to foreign policy and decisions about how to respond to crises overseas, the president still plays an important and arguably indispensable role,\" Davidson explained.\n\nHowever, he noted, \"Our current president, as the entire world now knows, cannot follow the train of his own thoughts. He seems to have only a tenuous grasp on reality. He can barely walk down a few steps. Clearly, he's not the one in charge of the White House, which means the presidency itself is remarkably weak right now. That in turn means the world is a much more dangerous place after last night, because America's adversaries know they have a narrow window to exploit the obvious weakness of our executive branch while Biden is still in office.\"\n\nThe danger, then, he explained, isn't what \"fallout\" there might be from the debate. \"It might be actual fallout.\"\n\nHe explained, \"Right now there are multiple hot conflicts around the world -- and not just low-level coups in small countries like Bolivia and Kenya. Israel is essentially at war with Iran. The Russia-Ukraine war rages on, no end in sight. And China could launch an invasion of Taiwan any day. These are dangerous times even without a dementia-addled 81-year-old in the White House. But the extent of Biden's decline has made it even more dangerous.\n\n\"To be clear, Biden has been unfit for office for years at this point. But the public spectacle of the debate gave a new urgency to a reality that our establishment media and political classes have been denying for a while now. Simply put, the debate made it undeniable that Biden is in a state of rapid decline. He can barely string a sentence together or keep track of what he's talking about. There is no way to spin it. The entire world saw the reality of our situation last night.\"\n\nIn contrast, he explained, was Trump.\n\n\"Cogent, forceful, and clear-eyed about the threats we face abroad and what he'll do about them,\" Davidson explained.\n\nIt was former deputy national security adviser for Trump K.T. McFarland who brought up the point that Iran, China and Russia, and others, \"realize they have a harrowing window of opportunity to exploit U.S. weakness.\"\n\nAlso there are key differences in the foreign policies pursued by Trump and Biden. Under Trump, Moscow didn't attack Ukraine and there was peace in the Middle East. Not so under Biden.\n\nThe differences, he said, are noted by \"our adversaries.\"\n\n\"They know it will be much harder to pursue their strategic aims during a second Trump administration for the simple reason that Trump's foreign policy is guided by nationalism in a way that Biden's is not,\" he said.\n\nAfter the debate, he warned, \"the entire world knows we don't have a competent commander in chief. We don't even have a president.\"\n\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

        "title": "Dueling Summits Show the Need to Enlist Arab Support on Ukraine",
        "body": "Key Middle East actors tend to distrust the U.S. narrative about the war and conclude they can reap better economic benefits from Russia, so Washington should do more to get them off the sidelines.\n\nTwo competing international gatherings took place this month: a Russian-hosted BRICS meeting in Nizhny Novgorod and a Ukraine peace summit in Lucerne, Switzerland. Alternative visions of the world order stood in the backdrop of these dueling events. Moscow wants to replace the U.S.-led liberal international order with a multipolar world, while the West wants to preserve the existing model. During his opening remarks in Nizhny Novgorod, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov highlighted the growing role of the BRICS alliance -- founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China and later joined by South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates -- in creating this new world order. In contrast, the Swiss summit -- organized in coordination with Kyiv but without Russia's participation -- aimed to build broader global support for Ukraine's vision of peace. Moscow dismissed the event as \"futile.\"\n\nThe meetings also represented a battle for support from \"global south\" countries in the Middle East and Africa. Many of these governments have declined to join Western efforts to isolate Russia during the Ukraine war; in fact, some have given Moscow an outlet to keep its economy afloat amid Western pressure, leaving President Vladimir Putin with little reason to change his cost-benefit calculus, halt the war, or seek a genuine peace settlement. Unfortunately, the outcome of the dueling summits suggests that most Arab partners are not contemplating any meaningful policy adjustments as the war surges on.\n\nWhat Happened at the Meetings?\n\nBRICS is a Russian creation -- Moscow spurred its initial formation in 2009 and assumed chairmanship of the organization earlier this year. The June 10-11 summit was the first gathering since BRICS expanded from five members to nine in January. The event proceedings included Lavrov's remarks decrying the West's perceived international dominance and its use of sanctions to \"influence the choice of development models.\" Afterward, twenty-two foreign ministers signed a joint statement focusing on de-dollarization, cooperation on a digital economy, and \"comprehensive reform\" of the UN General Assembly and Security Council.\n\nMeanwhile, the June 15-16 summit in Switzerland was perhaps Ukraine's most ambitious effort yet to rally global support for its vision of peace, with over 100 nations and organizations attending. Russia actively worked to undermine the event -- the Swiss government reported an increase in cyberattacks and disinformation in the run-up to the summit. In the end, eighty-three countries signed a joint communique that called for preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity as the basis for a peace settlement while touching on other issues such as nuclear safety, food security, and prisoner exchanges. President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the summit for making the \"first steps toward peace.\"\n\nStill, the majority of the communique's signatories were Western countries, which also sent higher-level representatives to the event. Several key powers from the global south attended but did not sign -- most notably India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates, all of whom have important trade relationships with Moscow. Among other factors, Russia's absence and the ongoing Gaza crisis likely convinced key Middle Eastern states to either not sign the communique or skip the summit entirely. Turkey attended and signed, but Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan noted that the summit would have been more \"result-oriented\" if Russia were present. After the communique was publicly released, Iraq, Jordan, and Rwanda reportedly withdrew their signatures. Egypt focused on the BRICS meeting instead, as did China.\n\nNo Real Saudi or Emirati Shift on Ukraine\n\nThe global role of the Gulf states -- especially leading energy producers Saudi Arabia and the UAE -- has only grown in importance since Russia invaded Ukraine. Saudi and Emirati state companies have taken advantage of the crisis by buying large amounts of Russian petroleum products at discount prices, despite U.S. objections that such purchases bolster Moscow and undermine Western sanctions. In addition, Putin traveled to both countries last December, further highlighting their willingness to court ties with the Kremlin.\n\nAccordingly, Zelensky made a special push to ensure Saudi participation in the Swiss summit. Initial reports suggested Riyadh would not send a delegation, but Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan wound up attending after Zelensky made a last-minute visit to Riyadh on June 12. While in Lucerne, Prince Faisal noted that Riyadh had leveraged its \"positive relations\" with both Ukraine and Russia.\n\nIndeed, the kingdom has sought to position itself as a mediator between Moscow and Kyiv at various times during the war, from facilitating a major prisoner exchange in September 2022 to providing over $400 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and hosting an international peace summit in August 2023. At the same time, however, the Saudis have been indirectly undermining Western sanctions by cooperating with Russia on oil issues -- not just purchasing its petroleum products as described above, but also coordinating production cuts that have kept oil prices (and, by extension, Russia's war budget) afloat. At the Swiss event, Riyadh noted that Russian participation in future summits would require a \"difficult compromise,\" implying that Ukraine would have to make greater concessions than it currently envisions.\n\nThe UAE's wartime balancing act has leaned even more toward Moscow. On one hand, Abu Dhabi announced early in the crisis that it would provide $5 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine in response to a UN appeal, and it has voted in favor of several UN resolutions regarding Russia's invasion. Most recently, it brokered an exchange of 180 prisoners of war between Ukraine and Russia. On the other hand, it has been careful not to condemn Moscow directly, and it joined the BRICS in January despite the ongoing international campaign to pressure Russia and end the war.\n\nPerhaps most important, the UAE has become Russia's largest trading partner in the Arab world. Bilateral trade was growing steadily before the war and continued that trajectory afterward, reaching $9 billion in 2022, the majority of which was Russian exports. The two countries reportedly aim to hit $10 billion by the end of 2024.\n\nWestern governments are particularly concerned about reports that some of this Emirati trade includes sanctioned dual-use items such as computer chips and electronics, which Russia could use in the war. Weeks before the Swiss summit, a U.S. delegation visited the UAE to press officials about the country's trade ties with Russia, highlighting the fact that certain companies have been evading sanctions.\n\nPolicy Implications\n\nAsking Arab partners to help isolate Russia has had little success so far. Yet Washington can still do more to show them that Moscow's vision for a new world order is a losing one, and that their fears about taking firmer action are exaggerated. One way to do so is by showing the limits of what the BRICS can accomplish, demonstrating that a transparent global trade system backed by the United States will generate more wealth for them than an oligarchic model led by Russia.\n\nAs for the Ukraine war, global south governments have been pushing their preference for a peace process in which both combatants are involved rather than a Kyiv-led process. This push seems rooted in three perceptions: that the United States has been unreliable and hypocritical in its relationships with Middle East partners, that they can derive genuine benefits from Moscow, and that Russia will remain a permanent fixture of international relations no matter how the war ends. More broadly, the global south is simply not buying the Western narrative about the war.\n\nThe Swiss summit did lay the groundwork for potential Russian participation in future peace talks. Zelensky reportedly considers Saudi Arabia as a prime candidate to host the next summit, highlighting the kingdom's importance for Ukraine. If Riyadh agrees to host, the United States would have ample opportunity to shape the next talks and engage regional countries on key concerns about Russia.\n\nAs for the terms of future talks, Russia should at minimum be expected to accept the principle of Ukrainian territorial integrity, even if only rhetorically at first. But actually reaching a successful diplomatic settlement will require changing Putin's cost-benefit calculus. If substantive talks take place before he is pushed into a losing position, he will have leverage to negotiate concessions that give Russia time and resources to rebuild its military and attack Ukraine again. Ultimately, a premature peace settlement would be of little use if it allows Russia to keep threatening Europe, global security, and the liberal world order in the long term. As this month's summits show, the fight to shift Putin's calculus is not limited to the battlefield, so Washington should marshal its diplomatic energies accordingly.\n\nAnna Borshchevskaya is a senior fellow in The Washington Institute's Diane and Guilford Glazer Foundation Program on Great Power Competition and the Middle East.",

        "body": "Chairman Xi, President Putin, Supreme Leader Khamanei, and the North Korean dictator might conclude that a president whose faculties seem compromised represents an opportunity to weaken America.\n\nIf adversaries deem America to be as feeble as President Biden appeared during Thursday's debate, will they use one of the lamest of lame-duck periods in history to undermine the country's global leadership and attack our allies?\n\nWhether Mr. Biden remains on the ticket in November or is replaced with another Democrat, his presidential term will last until January 20. After the CNN debate, Chairman Xi, President Putin, Supreme Leader Khamanei, and the North Korean dictator might conclude that a president whose faculties seem compromised represents an opportunity to weaken America.\n\nOne argument President Trump made Thursday is that world leaders do not respect Mr. Biden's America. \"He will drive us into World War III,\" the former president said. A similar argument was made by Democrats about Mr. Trump before his 2016 victory.\n\nIn the last three-and-a-half years, though, a global coalition of dictators has tightened significantly. A powerful bloc of world leaders, whose only common goal is to diminish America's power in the world, increased its cooperation.\n\nIran and North Korea are helping arm Russia for its Ukraine war. Russia is boosting Tehran's nuclear program. Communist China is buying subsidized oil from the Islamic Republic in defiance of American sanctions. Beijing is aiding Moscow financially and diplomatically.\n\nMoscow officials insist that Mr. Putin ignored the Biden-Trump showdown. \"I don't think that you can expect the Russian president to set his alarm to watch the debate,\" the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said. \"This isn't a main event for us.\"\n\nStill, the government-controlled Russian press was gleeful. \"Biden expectedly misspoke multiple times and stammered, Democrats have already called his performance a failure,\" a top press agency, RIA, writes. In Communist China, the Beijing-monitored social media outlet Weibo was just as snarky.\n\nConspiracy theories were freely expressed regarding Mr. Biden's condition, including unsubstantiated speculation about use of performance-enhancing drugs. \"A normal person blinks every 3 seconds when he speaks,\" according to one Weibo user, who asks, \"Why does Biden take 20 seconds?\"\n\nPopular comments aside, Chinese, Russian, Arab, and Iranian observers noticed that Democrats and former supporters were shocked by Mr. Biden's performance. Leaders must have heard a groundswell of calls on the president to withdraw from the race.\n\nWhether Mr. Biden remains on the top of the ticket or is replaced by another Democrat, he will remain president for nearly seven more months unless he resigns in favor of Vice President Harris. His debate image -- one of a frail, at times incoherent, and slow-witted leader -- could change calculations in world capitals.\n\nMr. Xi is scheduled to go to Peru in the fall for an Asia-Pacific summit. The visit will follow the November 5 presidential election, and Mr. Biden is yet to confirm his attendance. During the event, the Beijing strongman will inaugurate a $3.5 billion Peruvian project, a megaport built by a Beijing-controlled firm, Cosco.\n\nThe deep-water port will tighten commercial trade between Communist China and Latin America, and seal the growing ties between Beijing and the resource-rich Western Hemisphere. It will also bring the People's Liberation Navy ever closer to America's backyard. In his own backyard, meanwhile, Mr. Xi increasingly threatens the Philippines and other neighbors.\n\nBeijing may well assess that a weakened American presidency until January is a ripe moment to fulfill Mr. Xi's declared goal of annexing the island of Taiwan. Following Mr. Biden's debate performance, he might conclude that America's reaction would not be as forceful as the White House has declared it would be.\n\nIn the last few months, similarly, the Islamic Republic has installed 1,400 new high-speed uranium enrichment centrifuges inside the underground Fordow plant, in defiance of global pressure. The International Atomic Energy Agency reports that Iran is amassing enriched uranium to 60 percent purity, which could easily be converted to weapons level.\n\nWill the aging Mr. Khamenei decide that Mr. Biden's woes are a good time to complete the transformation of the Islamic Republic into a nuclear-armed power? Will President Kim of North Korea now seize the moment to attack South Korea? How about Mr. Putin's designs on the Baltic states?\n\nIsraelis are concerned that American weaknesses could harm their ability to fend off Tehran-backed armies that aim to grind them down by a war of attrition. Will Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, the Iraqi and Syrian militias, the Houthis, and, most notably, Hezbollah now use America's months of distraction to further escalate the war on the Jewish state?\n\nFacing such perils, Mr. Biden could make a decisive military move in one or more of these arenas. If successful, it would also enhance his political fortunes at home. Yet, his performance Thursday raises questions as to whether he is capable of making such bold decisions.",

        "title": "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: How is Egypt doing after a decade of his rule?",
        "body": "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, president of Egypt since June 2014, had visions about leading his country long before the 2013 coup that brought him to power.\n\nIn one dream, recounted to a local newspaper before he became leader, Sisi said he had a conversation with the late president Anwar al-Sadat: \"I told him that I knew I would become president of the republic, and he said he knew I would become president of the republic.\"\n\nIn another, he said he was told: \"We will give you what we have not given anyone.\"\n\nAbdel Fattah Saeed Hussein Khalil el-Sisi, the sixth president of Egypt, was born in Cairo on 19 November 1954. His father was an antiques merchant and his mother a homemaker.\n\nWhen he first became president, Sisi had no detailed political platform, no political party, and only two main promises: that he would bring about economic prosperity within two years in office; and that he would obliterate terrorism.\n\nYet, 10 years into his rule, Egyptians are getting poorer and the main targets of his war on terrorism appear to be the peaceful political opposition.\n\nSisi graduated from the Egyptian Military Academy in 1977. He then served in the armed forces, first commanding a mechanised division in the infantry, then as Egypt's military attaché in Riyadh and commander of Egypt's Northern Military Zone in Alexandria.\n\nDuring his military career, he studied at the British Command and Staff College in 1992 and the United States Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in 2006.\n\nSisi was also head of military intelligence until the 2011 revolution forced President Hosni Mubarak from power. But while he was promoted to field marshal in January 2014, just before retirement and after more than three decades of service, he never saw active combat.\n\nWith Mubarak gone, Sisi became the youngest member of the ruling interim military council, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (Scaf), which handed power to Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected president, in June 2012.\n\nTwo months later, Morsi appointed Sisi as defence minister and commander-in-chief of the army in a surprise reshuffle, forcing Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi into retirement after more than 20 years in the post.\n\nDuring this time, Sisi came to prominence as a de facto mediator between Morsi and members of the opposition in an apparent challenge to the president.\n\nA year into Morsi's rule, and following large anti-government protests against the backdrop of political and economic malaise, Sisi staged a successful coup on 3 July against the administration, detaining the president and his senior staff and declaring an interim government in which Sisi was to serve as deputy prime minister.\n\nThroughout the months following the removal of Morsi, Sisi denied any intention to run for office and insisted that his move was not a coup.\n\nSisi's supporters regarded the protests as a second revolution after the January 2011 revolution that ousted Mubarak. In contrast, Sisi's opponents called it a bloody coup against popular legitimacy and the will of Egyptians, as expressed through democracy.\n\nIn the months following the coup, Sisi oversaw what rights groups described as possible crimes against humanity, as thousands of pro-Morsi protesters were gunned down or detained in the country's worst episode of police brutality in modern history.\n\nThe crackdown culminated in what became known as the Rabaa massacre, in which more than a thousand protesters who demanded an end to the coup were killed by security forces in one day on 14 August 2013 in Cairo's Rabaa Square.\n\nIn addition to his position as deputy prime minister, Sisi also retained his position as minister of defence, and was often the public face of the new administration.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Rabaa massacre, he sought a direct \"authoritsation\" from the Egyptian people to manage what he said was terrorism. He eventually retired from his military career in March 2014 and announced that he would run as a candidate in the May 2014 presidential election.\n\nSisi ran against one opponent, Hamdeen Sabbahi, one of the left-wing politicians who supported the coup and was elected president with 97 percent of the vote. He was sworn in as president on 8 June 2014.\n\nThe election was widely considered to be a sham, as most of Sisi's possible opponents were in jail, including Morsi and supporters of his Muslim Brotherhood group, along with senior opposition leaders from other parties that rejected the coup, and secular youth leaders of the 2011 revolution.\n\nSisi was reelected four years later in 2018 and introduced constitutional amendments in 2019 that would allow him to stay in power for two further consecutive terms of six years each instead of four. Sisi is currently serving his third term after his election in December 2023 and reinstatement as president in April 2024. As things stand, he will be obliged to stand down in 2030.\n\nIn every election that followed the 2013 coup, Sisi's potential opponents have been excluded, jailed, or disqualified. This includes Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister under Mubarak and Morsi's main presidential rival, who was reportedly forced out of the 2018 race after threats from a senior intelligence officer.\n\nAnother rival, Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, was detained after calling for a boycott of the 2018 vote; a third, General Sami Anan was detained for more than a year and has been under house arrest since his announcement that he would run for presidency in 2018.\n\nThe latest challenger to Sisi, left-wing politician Ahmed Tantawy, has also been detained in the aftermath of the 2023 elections and is currently serving a one-year prison term for alleged unauthorised campaign activities.\n\nSisi did not present a detailed electoral platform at the start of his rule 10 years ago. Instead, he made broad promises to improve living standards and to protect the poorest segments of society.\n\nHe used a style of communication that played on the popular imagination and that seemed to ensure his popularity for several years, using phrases such as \"Egypt is the mother of the world\" and pledging that he would again make it world-class.\n\nSisi also lamented that previous leaders did not sufficiently care for the people and that what was needed was empathy and concern. He promised unprecedented economic prosperity within two years. When that failed to materialise by 2015, he promised that 2020 would see the culmination of significant economic development. When that failed to materialise he blamed the Covid crisis and the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nHowever economic indicators have consistently worsened under his rule. Egypt is the most populous Arab country, with an estimated 106m people. The World Bank estimated that nearly 30 percent of its population was poor in 2019, with millions more at risk of falling below the poverty line.\n\nThe Egyptian pound has dwindled by more than 600 percent since Sisi came to power in 2014 when it traded at about seven pounds to the dollar. At the time of writing it is now at around $48 to the dollar.\n\nThe cost of food staples has risen due to currency fluctuations: in June 2024, the government increased the price of subsidised bread by 300 percent, for the first time in 35 years, affecting an estimated 65m Egyptians who rely on bread as their main food staple.\n\nBut as the economy faltered, so Sisi shifted into blame mode. In January 2023, he attacked the media for negative public reaction about the food costs. \"Why do you portray Egyptians as if they are in a state of panic over food and drink? This is not appropriate,\" he said. \"I am not saying this is not true; but eating and drinking is not the end of the world.\"\n\nIn a later speech in October 2023, Sisi called his opponents \"liars, saboteurs and wicked\", as critics questioned the billions spent on infrastructure projects while many Egyptians struggled. \"Don't you Egyptians dare say you would rather eat than build and progress,\" Sisi said. \"If the price of the nation's progress and prosperity is to go hungry and thirsty, then let us not eat or drink.\n\n\"Don't undermine the cause of our nation and make us the world's laughing stock. Stand fast and transform the cruel circumstances we are going through into a gift. The harder you stand fast, the sooner it [the economic crises] will pass.\"\n\nSince Sisi took power, Egypt's debt has more than tripled to $165bn. In addition, it has paid $132bn in installments and interest on external debt over the same period, with these payments accounting for most of government expenditure. In February, foreign currency reserves stood at only $35bn.\n\nIn February, global partners including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Union, and the United Arab Emirates signed rescue deals with Egypt worth more than $57bn.\n\nA $35bn deal with the UAE in February for Cairo to build a new city on Egypt's north coast boosted government confidence enough that it floated the currency, one of the bailout conditions imposed by the IMF.\n\nThe government has also been criticised for not allocating the constitutionally mandated percentages of expected GDP to budget for education and healthcare: each sector respectively only received 1.94 percent (instead of six percent) and 1.5 percent (instead of three percent).\n\nSisi's economic vision, known as Egypt Vision 2030 (and inspired by the Saudi strategy Vision 2030) is largely based on expensive mega projects that he believes can transform the country's future\n\nThey include the digging of a 35km lane along a section of the Suez Canal, branded as a \"New Suez Canal\". The project cost $8.2bn: Sisi promised it would boost the canal's revenues and alleviate Egypt's economic woes. Yet, the canal's revenues have dropped in recent years and Egypt is now considering a further expansion of the strategic waterway.\n\nA study by the Alternative Policy Solutions think tank at the American University in Cairo published in August showed that the 2015 project has not boosted the canal's income as hoped: expenditures including wages and taxes, have increased in line with revenues, with the cost-to-income ratio a negative indicator of the profitability of the project since 2015.\n\nAnother mega project, and one of the blueprints for Sisi's rule, is the New Administrative Capital (NAC), a $58bn \"smart city\" that is intended to relieve some of the congestion in Cairo. It's where Sisi inaugurated his 2024 term, and to where he and key government ministers and agencies have relocated since April.\n\nNAC, which is publicly funded and has yet to have a name, is some 45km east of Cairo. The first of three phases was scheduled to be completed by 2020 but is unfinished due to a lack of funds. Economic experts now question its feasibility, given Egypt's ailing economy.\n\nCombating terrorism was one of Sisi's main pledges on taking power. The Egyptian military fought an Islamic State insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula for years, which initially emerged after the revolution in 2011 and became deadlier after the fall of Morsi in 2013. Sisi eventually announced the defeat of the group in 2022.\n\nHowever, the campaign has been denounced for its disproportionate impact on the civilian population. Human Rights Watch has accused the Egyptian army of possible war crimes against the tribal communities of North Sinai, including mass displacement and extrajudicial killings.\n\nThe Egyptian army has also been accused of not holding members of Islamic State accountable for alleged atrocities, and instead granting them amnesty. A senior IS leader behind a 2017 attack that killed more than 300 civilians in a Sinai mosque was released by the Sisi government in 2021 after a deal.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sisi government has accused its peaceful opposition of supporting terrorism, and labelled the Muslim Brotherhood as well as the secular 6 April group, as terrorist groups.\n\nMembers of Sisi's opposition from across the political spectrum, as well as journalists and social media influencers, have faced allegations of supporting terrorism. Rights groups, however, have dismissed these allegations as politically motivated.\n\nMost of those on the government's terror list are members or supporters of the political opposition.\n\nSince the coup, Sisi has led a ferocious crackdown on any opposition, initially targeting members and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the group from which Morsi hailed. Sisi then extended the suppression to members of the secular and left-wing opposition, along with civil society and independent media.\n\nAt the time of writing, an estimated 65,000 political prisoners detained in the aftermath of Sisi's coup are still in jail, including politicians, protesters, journalists, and civil society activists. Most are either in pre-trial detention for indefinite periods; or face charges of supporting terrorism, espionage, unlawful protests, and spreading false news, among other related charges.\n\nYet Sisi, in an interview with the American CBS's 60 Minutes TV show in 2019, denied his country holds any political prisoners.\n\nSisi's campaign against the opposition has been decried as the worst human rights crisis in the country's modern history, according to the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS). On 14 August 2013 alone, security forces killed more than 1,000 anti-Sisi protesters in what became known as the Rabaa Massacre.\n\nTorture has also become widespread under Sisi. A legal analysis by local and international rights groups has concluded that it now amounts to a crime against humanity, given how systematic and widespread it has become, involving methodical beatings, electrical shocks, sexual violence, and denial of medical care.\n\nSince his coup in 2013, Sisi has been backed by the UAE and Saudi Arabia, who supported his government politically and financially.\n\nIn one of his most controversial decisions, since he became president, Sisi in 2016 signed an order ceding the strategic Red Sea islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia, prompting widespread protests and an unsuccessful court case challenging the decision.\n\nIn contrast, Qatar initially opposed the coup and the associated crackdown on Qatari-backed Al Jazeera in Egypt, along with the suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood, the political group supported by Doha.\n\nEgypt was also among the states that severed ties with Qatar in 2017, citing its alleged support for the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran. Doha-Cairo relations later thawed in 2021 as part of a reconciliation between Gulf countries and Qatar.\n\nEgyptian-Turkish relations also became strained after the coup, due to Ankara's support for Morsi's democratically-elected government and its rejection of his deposal the coup and the bloody aftermath.\n\nBut relations subsequently improved, with the restoration of diplomatic ties, and Turkish President Recep Tayyib Erdogan visiting Cairo to meet with Sisi in February 2024, despite regarding his Egyptian counterpart as a coup leader for most of the past decade.\n\nDespite initial criticism of the coup and the Rabaa massacre, Cairo has maintained close ties with successive US administrations. Former US President Donald Trump called Sisi \"my favourite dictator\", and Washington has continued to provide Egypt with military aid despite human rights concerns.\n\nThe EU has also continued to support Sisi, despite criticism of his human rights record by member states.\n\nThe Sisi government remains an Israel ally despite the latter's devastating war on neighbouring Gaza and Israel's takeover of the strategic Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt.\n\nEgypt continues to act as a mediator between Israel and Palestinian groups, but that role has declined in recent years and Doha has played a more prominent role in mediation.\n\nIsrael's control of the Rafah crossing has also dealt a blow to Egypt's leverage in Gaza and its ability to influence the conflict.",

Despite these issues, Sisi has maintained support from international allies like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and the US. His economic policies, including mega projects like the New Administrative Capital, have faced criticism for their feasibility amid Egypt's economic struggles. Sisi's government has also been accused of mismanaging funds for education and healthcare. While he claims to have defeated terrorism, his methods have been criticized for their impact on civilians.

        "title": "Who is Nigel Farage? The divisive figure whose party is stealing votes from the Tories",
        "body": "Nigel Farage has been a fixture of British politics for almost three decades, despite never being elected to Parliament. Here's everything you need to know about the man who says he wants to take over the Tories.\n\nNigel Farage has been a fixture of British politics for almost three decades, agitating over Europe and causing dissent within the Conservative Party. He played a significant role in Britain leaving the EU - something will continue to have major ramifications for years to come - yet he's only ever sat as an MP in the European Parliament.\n\nHe led the UK Independence Party (Ukip) for two decades until 2016, before forming the Brexit Party and later Reform UK.\n\nNow he's leading the party and standing for election in the right-leaning seat of Clacton. Is he starting a revolution, as he claims? Here's all you need to know about the most influential man who has never yet been elected to Westminster.\n\nFarage was born in Farnborough, Kent, in 1964 and grew up alongside his younger brother Andrew in a wealthy family.\n\nAccording to a BBC documentary his father, an alcoholic who lost his role in the City as a stockbroker, left the family home when he was five years old.\n\nTwo years later he got sober and found employment in the antiques trade. As a young boy, Farage was educated at the independent Greenhayes School for Boys in West Wickham.\n\nFarage is currently in a relationship with Lauré Ferrari, the hard-right French politician who is more than 15 years his junior, though he has been married twice before.\n\nHis first marriage to Grainne Hayes, a lecturer in exercise physiology, lasted from 1988 to 1997 with the couple having two sons, Thomas and Samuel. He then married German-born Kirsten Mehr, his former secretary, in 1999. The pair had two daughters, Victoria and Isabelle, but Farage faced accusations of infidelity and by 2017 the couple were understood to be living separate lives.\n\nAll four of his children are known to be very private. Isabelle, who is just 19 years old and on a gap year, flew out to Australia to meet him when he left the bush camp for the reality TV show 'I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here' last year.\n\nFarage is the son of Barbara and Guy Justus Oscar Farage. After his father gave up alcohol he was able to return to his career in the City, trading on the Stock Exchange floor from the mid-1970s.\n\nHis grandfather, Harry Farage, was a private who was wounded in action during the First World War. He is descended from German immigrants who arrived in London from Frankfurt in the 1860s.\n\nAs a teenager, Farage attended the elite south London independent school for boys, Dulwich College. He joined the Conservative Party while still at school after being inspired by a visit from former Tory minister Keith Joseph.\n\nBut his early engagement in right-wing politics also courted controversy. In Michael Crick's biography of Farage, One Party After Another, former student David Edmonds, his classmate when he was 15, described him as a \"deeply unembarrassed racist\".\n\nIn 1981, Chloe Deakin, an English teacher at the school, wrote to the headmaster of Dulwich College, David Emms, to urge him not to make Farage a prefect, fearing he held \"fascist\" views - a claim that Farage later rejected.\n\nAccording to Crick, the letter describes a colleague talking about Farage's \"publicly professed racist and neo-fascist views\". The letter goes on to claim that, at a Combined Cadet Force (CCF) camp organised by the college, Farage and others \"marched through a quiet Sussex village very late at night shouting Hitler-youth songs.\"\n\nConfronted by these claims in 2013, Farage said: \"Of course I said some ridiculous things\" but insisted they were \"not necessarily racist\" adding it \"depends how you define it\". He denied even knowing the words to Hitler youth songs, describing the claim as \"complete baloney\".\n\nOthers spoken to by Crick said Farage would have been joking and being deliberately provocative. Farage's own memoir, Fighting Bull, claims teachers were hostile to him because he was an admirer of Enoch Powell, the controversial anti-immigration Conservative politician. Nevertheless, he was appointed prefect by the head.\n\nAt 18, Farage shunned a university education in favour of entering the City as a commodities trader.\n\nIn announcing his candidacy in this election and taking over leadership of his Reform party from former incumbent Richard Tice, Farage said that this general election should be \"the immigration election\".\n\nIn a social media post aimed at attacking the Conservative record on immigration, he claimed that the 50,000th migrant had crossed the English Channel in a small boat under Rishi Sunak's leadership. He has previously stated that the arrival of migrants from France on small boats \"should be declared a national emergency\".\n\nReform wants to achieve \"net zero\" immigration, and Farage has blamed immigration for rising rents, heavy traffic, the strain on social housing and long hospital waiting lists.\n\nHis manifesto states that Reform would freeze all non-essential migration, allowing entry only to those who have \"essential skills, mainly around healthcare\". However, his comments have caused anger after he claimed there were streets in the city of Oldham where nobody speaks English.\n\nUnique among the party leaders, Farage does not support a National Health Service funded solely through taxation. He has said the \"model through which we fund health is wrong\" and has called for a social health insurance scheme similar to that already used in France.\n\nHe said: \"It's been very, very difficult to have any conversation about the NHS over the course of the 25 years that I've been in politics without someone pointing and screaming 'you want to privatise it. All we want is an NHS that is free at the point of the delivery that actually works. And how we get there, frankly, I don't think most people could give a damn about.\"\n\nThe party's manifesto promises to give patients a voucher to see a private GP if they're left waiting more than three days to see their family doctor on the NHS.\n\nDespite being Brexit's primary agitator for more than two decades and pushing former Conservative leader David Cameron to call the Brexit referendum in 2016, Farage has since declared \"Brexit has failed\".\n\n\"We've not delivered on Brexit and the Tories have let us down very, very badly,\" he said.\n\nFarage has attacked the government for failing to bring any economic benefits to the country by departing the European Union. Rather than admitting Brexit might have been a mistake, he said \"useless\" Tory politicians were responsible for \"mismanaging\" the process of leaving the EU.\n\nArguing with Remain voters while appearing on TV show 'I'm a Celebrity...', Farage said Brexit had given the UK the freedom to \"make a mess of it ourselves\".\n\nHis attacks on the Conservative Party have even extended to his claim that he wants to take over the party after the election.\n\nDespite achieving rapid success in the polls since announcing his return to UK politics, Farage hit a pothole in the road after he claimed that Western nations and Nato were responsible for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"We provoked this war ... he's used what we've done as an excuse,\" he wrote in a newspaper article. \"Don't blame me for telling the truth.\"\n\nHe added: \"It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union was giving this man [Vladimir Putin] a reason to go to his Russian people to say, 'They're coming for us again' and to go to war.... I saw it coming a decade ago, warned that it was coming and am one of the few political figures who has been consistently right and honest about Russia's Ukraine war.\"\n\nHis comments were met with outrage from voters and other parties. Rishi Sunak accused him of \"appeasement\" of Putin and described him as \"dangerous for Britain's security\".\n\nFarage has long questioned the basis of climate science and argues that the push for net zero by 2050 is bad for the Britain economy. In an interview with the magazine Spiked, he said that the growth of wind energy as a clean source of power was the \"biggest collective economic insanity I've seen in my entire life\".\n\nHe has argued that the case that fossil fuels are a diminishing resource is \"based on a fallacy\" and that there is no need to change the way we live to become more ecologically sustainable.\n\n\"We are a nation that produces 1.8 per cent of global carbon dioxide, so I do not get closing down our aluminium smelters, most of our steel production, and now our refining industry, and all that production being moved to India, and therefore the steel-based products made in India then having to be shipped back to Britain! This to me makes no sense at all,\" Farage said.",

        "body": "OPINION - The Cipher Brief tapped expert Dave Pitts for his reaction to Thursday night's debate from a national security perspective.\n\n\"To the original national security questions, the debate was light on real foreign policy and national security issues and discussions. But to the one national security issue that was discussed, there was nothing really new on the question of continued support to Ukraine, although the debate highlighted stark differences in approach to foreign policy.\n\nBoth candidates stated that Putin's terms for ending the war were unacceptable, but the agreements stopped there.\n\nPresident Biden upheld his position of strong, continued support to Ukraine, intent for a strong NATO, and his commitment that Putin could not be allowed to continue his aggression.\n\nIt's not just for the President anymore. Cipher Brief Subscriber+Members have access to their own Open Source Daily Brief, keeping you up to date on global events impacting national security. It pays to be a Subscriber+Member.\n\nFormer President Trump also upheld his previously stated position that the Russian invasion would not have happened under his Presidency, that NATO was not doing enough, that the U.S was spending too much money in Ukraine, and that he would end the Russia-Ukraine War before he took office, if elected.\n\nAlthough other Republican leaders have expressed strong support for Ukraine, this potential conflict within the Republican Party on how to approach the Russia-Ukraine War, if there is a change in Administration, could embolden Putin, confuse our allies, and weaken Ukraine in the process.\n\nBased on this debate, certainly Ukraine, NATO, Russia, China, and other countries will anticipate a change in the U.S position on Ukraine and on other foreign policy issues if there is a new administration. Of course, there is a lot to time before the election and things can change, so stay tuned.\"\n\nThe Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.\n\nHave a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

Prior to this, Modi met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the G-7 summit in Italy, advising dialogue for conflict resolution.\n\nTV9 correspondent Manish Jha reported from the frontline in Kharkiv, where he observed Russian soldiers watching Hindi films and expressing a fondness for India, Bollywood, and Indian cuisine. This sentiment was echoed in other conflict zones like Avdiivka, Bakhmut, and Mariupol, where soldiers from both sides showed enthusiasm for India and shared their experiences and aspirations to visit the country.\n\nJha noted that his identity as an Indian journalist often ensured his safety, as both Russian and Ukrainian forces respected India's neutral stance and trusted Indian journalists to remain impartial and not disclose sensitive information. This respect was highlighted by a Russian officer's belief that Hindu deities would protect both their soldiers and Jha."

        "body": "टोरंटो: कनाडा के प्रधानमंत्री जस्टिन ट्रूडो के बुरे दिनों की शुरुआत होने वाली है। एक ताजा सर्वेक्षण के अनुसार, ट्रूडो की लिबरल पार्टी मतदाताओं का भरोसा खो रही है। इतना ही नहीं, ट्रूडो के सरकार में सहयोगी खालिस्तान समर्थक जगमीत सिंह के नेतृत्व वाली न्यू डेमोक्रेटिक पार्टी से भी लोगों का विश्वास खत्म हो चुका है। इससे अगले साल होने वाले आम चुनाव से पहले ट्रूडो के नेतृत्व को लेकर संदेह पैदा हो रहा है। लिबरल पार्टी के खिलाफ कोविड महामारी के दौरान ठीक से प्रबंधन नहीं करने, देश में महंगाई बढ़ाने और घरों के संकट से लोगों में गहरी नाराजगी है। कनाडाई लोग इस बात से भी नाराज हैं कि उनकी सरकार ने रूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध और गाजा पट्टी पर इजरायल के हमले में मजबूत स्टैंड नहीं लिया।\n\nतेजी से घट रहा ट्रूडो की पार्टी का समर्थन\n\nनेशनल पोस्ट के लिए किए गए लेजर पोल के अनुसार, अगर आज चुनाव होते हैं, तो एनडीपी के समर्थन में एक प्रतिशत की गिरावट आएगी, जो 2021 के संघीय चुनावों के दौरान 18 प्रतिशत से घटकर 17 प्रतिशत रह जाएगी। महत्वपूर्ण बात यह है कि सर्वेक्षण में शामिल अधिकतर लोगों ने महसूस किया कि एनडीपी और जगमीत सिंह के बारे में उनकी धारणा 'खराब' हुई है, क्योंकि केवल 20 प्रतिशत लोगों ने उन्हें पहले के 32 प्रतिशत के मुकाबले अधिक अनुकूल माना है।\n\nट्रूडो की पार्टी को लगा करारा झटका\n\nटोरंटो-सेंट में जून के संघीय उपचुनाव के दौरान एनडीपी को परेशान करने वाले संकेतों का सामना करना पड़ा। पॉल के नेतृत्व में, जहां इसका वोट शेयर 17 प्रतिशत से घटकर 11 प्रतिशत हो गया, जो ट्रूडो की पार्टी के लिए एक भयावह परिणाम था, जिसने 1993 से अपने पास रखी एक सीट खो दी। जगमीत सिंह ने अक्टूबर 2017 में एनडीपी का नेतृत्व संभाला। उनके नेतृत्व से पहले, एनडीपी के पास हाउस ऑफ कॉमन्स में 44 सीटें थीं और पिछले संघीय चुनाव में लगभग 20 प्रतिशत वोट शेयर था। 2021 तक, ये संख्याएं काफी कम हो गई थीं, जिसमें एनडीपी ने 25 सांसदों का चुनाव किया और लगभग 18 प्रतिशत वोट शेयर हासिल किया।\n\nट्रूडो का साथ छोड़ेंगे जगमीत सिंह?\n\nजगमीत सिंह ने पिछले सप्ताह कहा, \"हम इसे एक संदेश के रूप में देखते हैं जो लोग भेज रहे हैं। वे ट्रूडो से निराश हैं। वे ट्रूडो से तंग आ चुके हैं, और वे लिबरल पार्टी से निराश हैं, और उनके पास इसके लिए कारण भी हैं।\" हालांकि, मार्च 2022 में \"आपूर्ति और विश्वास समझौते\" में प्रवेश करने के बाद, अल्पमत में आ चुकी ट्रूडो सरकार जगमीत सिंह की एनडीपी के समर्थन से बच रही है। जबकि, जगमीत सिंह इस बात पर चुप हैं कि क्या वह ट्रूडो का समर्थन करना जारी रखेंगे, उन्होंने कहा कि सरकार के लिए चीजें बदतर होती जा रही हैं।\n\nअभी चुनाव हो तो क्या होंगे परिणाम\n\nलेगर पोल के समग्र आंकड़ों के अनुसार, कंजर्वेटिव पार्टी को 41 प्रतिशत समर्थन प्राप्त है, जो लिबरल्स से बहुत आगे है। लिबरल को सिर्फ 27 प्रतिशत समर्थन मिलता दिख रहा है। यदि अभी चुनाव होते, तो कंजर्वेटिव 218 सीटें प्राप्त कर लेते, जबकि वर्तमान में सत्ता पर काबिज ट्रूडो की लिबरल पार्टी को केवल 67 सीटें प्राप्त होतीं। ट्रूडो की पार्टी को हाल ही में टोरंटो जिले के लिए एक विशेष चुनाव में बड़ी पराजय का सामना करना पड़ा, जिस पर उसने तीन दशकों से कब्ज़ा किया हुआ है। विपक्षी कंजर्वेटिव उम्मीदवार डॉन स्टीवर्ट ने टोरंटो-सेंट पॉल जिले में लगभग 600 वोटों से जीत हासिल की, जो लिबरल उम्मीदवार के 40.5 प्रतिशत से 42.1 प्रतिशत अधिक है।",

        "summary": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's political future appears uncertain as his Liberal Party loses voter confidence, according to a recent survey. The New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Khalistan supporter Jagmeet Singh, is also seeing a decline in support. Key issues include dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, housing crisis, and lack of strong stances on international conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nA Léger poll for the National Post indicates that if elections were held today, the NDP's support would drop from 18% to 17%, and Trudeau's Liberals would face significant losses, securing only 67 seats compared to the Conservative Party's 218 seats. The Liberals recently lost a long-held seat in a Toronto by-election, signaling deeper troubles. Jagmeet Singh has expressed public disappointment with Trudeau but remains non-committal about withdrawing support. The Conservatives currently lead with 41% support, far ahead of the Liberals' 27%."

        "body": "Ukraine Drone Attack Russia: रूस और यूक्रेन के बीच महीनों से जारी युद्ध हर दिन नए लेवल पर पहुंच रहा है. यूक्रेन ने रूस ...अधिक पढ़ें\n\nमॉस्को. आज के इस इकोनोमिक डिप्लोमेसी के युग में किसी को पंगु या बेबस करने का सबसे अच्छा तरीका उसे आर्थिक रूप से कमजोर करना माना जाता है. महीनों से जारी रूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध पर भी यह लागू होता है. रूस ने पहले यूक्रेन की कमर तोड़ने के लिए उसके गैस सप्लाई चैन को तोड़ा. अब यूक्रेन भी उसी तर्ज पर रूस को कमजोर करने की कोशिश में जुटा है. इसी का नतीजा है कि ब्लैक सी में स्थित रूस के सबसे बड़े पोर्ट नोवोरोसिस्क बंदरगाह पर ड्रोन से हमला किया गया है. इस पोर्ट के महत्व को इसी से समझा जा सकता है कि इसे ऑयल एक्सपोर्ट का बड़ा हब माना जाता है. ड्रोन अटैक के बाद रूस ने कुछ देर के लिए बीच को आमलोगों के लिए बंद कर दिया था. हालांकि, बाद में इस चेतावनी को वापस ले ली गई.\n\nइंटरफैक्स समाचार एजेंसी ने स्थानीय प्रशासन के हवाले से बुधवार को बताया कि यूक्रेनी समुद्री ड्रोन हमले के प्रयास के बाद रूस के काला सागर बंदरगाह (ब्लैक सी पोर्ट) नोवोरोसिस्क पर फिर से कामकाज सुचारू हो गया है. स्थानीय प्रशासन के एक बयान के हवाले से बताया गया है कि इस हमले के बाद कोई प्रतिबंध नहीं है. शिपिंग सामान्य रूप से चल रही है. नोवोरोसिस्क रूस का ब्लैक सी में सबसे बड़ा बंदरगाह है और दक्षिण रूस में कच्चे तेल और तेल उत्पादों के निर्यात का एक प्रमुख केंद्र है. यह कजाकिस्तान और अजरबैजान से आने वाले तेल को भी लोड करता है और अनाज, कोयला, उर्वरक, लकड़ी, कंटेनर, भोजन और केमिकल कार्गो का काम भी यहां से होता है.\n\nरूस ने आधी रात को खारकीव में अपार्टमेंट पर बरसाए बम, यूक्रेन में बड़ा हमला करने की तैयारी\n\nड्रोन हमले का असर\n\nनोवोरोसिस्क के मेयर आंद्रेई क्रावचेंको ने बुधवार को पहले समुद्र तटों पर जाने को लेकर आमलोगों को आगाह किया और प्रतिबंध लगा दिया. बाद में उन्होंने कहा कि सभी प्रतिबंध हटा दिए गए हैं. उन्होंने बताया कि ड्रोन अटैक और कहा कि हमलों में दो कमर्शियल प्रोपर्टी और एक आवासीय अपार्टमेंट मामूली तौर पर नुकसान पहुंचा है. इस हमले में किसी के घायल होने की सूचना नहीं है. रूसी रक्षा मंत्रालय ने कहा कि सेना ने नोवोरोसिस्क की ओर जा रहे दो समुद्री ड्रोनों को नष्ट कर दिया है. बता दें कि रूस ने बार-बार कहा है कि यूक्रेन ने ब्लैक सी कोस्ट पर उसके बंदरगाह शहरों पर हमला किया है, लेकिन रूसी अधिकारी अक्सर यूक्रेनी हमलों से हुए नुकसान के बारे में कम विवरण देते हैं.\n\nमई में भी बनाया था निशाना\n\nबता दें कि मई में भी बंदरगाह पर ड्रोन से हमला किया गया था, जिससे अधिकारियों को अस्थायी रूप से आउटलेट बंद करना पड़ा था. नोवोरोसिस्क से यूरल्स, केईबीसीओ और साइबेरियन लाइट ग्रेड की लोडिंग जुलाई में 1.7-1.8 मिलियन मीट्रिक टन निर्धारित है. रूसी रक्षा मंत्रालय ने कहा कि उसकी वायु रक्षा प्रणालियों ने यूक्रेन द्वारा रूस के क्षेत्र में लॉन्च किए गए 10 हवाई ड्रोनों को नष्ट कर दिया, जिनमें से एक मॉस्को क्षेत्र में भी शामिल था. दूसरी तरफ, यूक्रेन की ओर से तत्काल कोई टिप्पणी नहीं आई है.",

This attack is part of Ukraine's strategy to weaken Russia economically, similar to Russia's earlier efforts to disrupt Ukraine's gas supply chain. Following the attack, the port's operations were temporarily halted, but later resumed without restrictions. The attack caused minor damage to two commercial properties and a residential apartment, with no reported injuries. Russia's defense ministry claimed to have destroyed two Ukrainian marine drones heading towards the port. This incident follows a similar drone attack on the port in May. Additionally, Russia reported destroying ten aerial drones launched by Ukraine, including one in the Moscow region. Ukraine has not commented on the attack."

This request was made by Sammy Kotwani, the president of the Indian National Cultural Center 'SITA'. The demand comes ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia on July 8, where he will meet President Vladimir Putin. This will be Modi's first visit to Russia since the Russia-Ukraine war began.\n\nKotwani believes that a temple would provide a place for the growing Hindu community in Russia to engage in religious and spiritual activities. He noted that many Indians, including students and professionals, have settled in Russia in recent years, and a temple would meet their religious and cultural needs.\n\nDespite Russia being a predominantly Orthodox Christian country, Kotwani does not expect the demand for a Hindu temple to negatively impact India-Russia relations. He emphasized that Russia has been generally tolerant of various religions and cultures, and the request aligns with the strong bilateral relationship between the two nations. Kotwani hopes that the temple will attract not only Hindus but also people of other faiths.\n\nThe Hindu population in Russia is estimated to be around 30,000, primarily consisting of Indian expatriates. The establishment of a temple is seen as essential to cater to their religious and spiritual needs. Historically, Hinduism began to appear in Russia in the late 19th century, and Indian cultural elements like books, yoga, and spirituality gained attention during the Soviet era.\n\nEarlier this year, Prime Minister Modi inaugurated the first Hindu temple in the Muslim-majority United Arab Emirates, highlighting the significance of such cultural centers for the Hindu community abroad."

He criticized peace summits as ineffective, noting that key countries do not participate.\n\nRecently, a Ukraine Peace Summit was held in Switzerland with around 90 countries, including India, which did not endorse any proposals. Russia and China did not attend. Nebenzya highlighted that Putin's ceasefire proposal from June 14 remains open, requiring Ukraine to withdraw troops from areas occupied by Russia in 2022 and abandon its NATO ambitions. Ukrainian President Zelensky has rejected this proposal, refusing to cede any territory.\n\nTrump has consistently claimed he could stop the war quickly if elected, blaming Biden for the conflict. The Russia-Ukraine war has been ongoing for over two years, with significant casualties and millions of Ukrainians displaced."

        "body": "डिजिटल डेस्क, नई दिल्ली। हाल ही में हुई अमेरिका की प्रेसिडेंशियल डिबेट में डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने बड़ा दावा किया था। उन्होंने कहा था कि यदि वे राष्ट्रपति बने तो 24 घंटे के भीतर रूस-यूक्रेन जंग को रुकवा देंगे। उनके इस बयान पर अब रूस का जवाब आया है। यूएन में रूस के राजदूत ने कहा है कि ट्रम्प ऐसा नहीं करेंगे। उन्होंने कहा कि यह जंग तो शुरू होन के दो महीने बाद यानी 2022 के अप्रैल में ही रुक सकती थी। लेकिन अमेरिका समेत अन्य पश्चिमी देशों ने ऐसा नहीं होने दिया।\n\nवे चाहते हैं हम लड़ते रहें\n\nरूसी राजदूत नेबेंजिया ने कहा कि पश्चिमी देश चाहते थे यूक्रेन और हमारे बीच लड़ाई होती रहे। जेलेंसकी अलग-अलग शांति सम्मेलनों में भाग ले रहे हैं। जो कि एक मजाक है। बता दें कि पिछले महीने स्विट्जरलैंड में यूक्रेन युद्ध को लेकर एक शांति सम्मेलन आयोजित हुआ था। 90 देशों के इस सम्मेलन 10 पॉइंट का एक प्रस्ताव तैयार किया था। जिसमें जंग को खत्म करने के लिए यूक्रेन से रूसी सेना की वापसी की मांग की गई थी। रूस ने इसका विरोध किया था।\n\nबता दें कि ट्रम्प पिछले साल से 24 घंटे में जंग रुकवाने का राग अलाप रहे हैं। उन्होंने सबसे पहले मई 2023 में कहा था कि जंग में रूसी और यूक्रेन के नागरिक मर रहे हैं। मैं ये जंग 24 घंटे में रुकवा दूंगा। उस समय ट्रम्प ने कहा था कि वो पहले यूक्रेन के राष्ट्रपति जेलेंस्की और फिर रूस के राष्ट्रपति पुतिन से मुलाकात करेंगे। इसके बाद ट्रम्प लगातार इस बात को दोहराते रहे हैं।\n\nप्रेसिडेंशियल डिबेट में अमेरिका के पूर्व राष्ट्रपति ने यहां तक कह दिया था कि बाइडेन ने पुतिन पर जंग थोपी है। यदि वे राष्ट्रपति होते तो ये जंग कभी हुई ही नहीं होती। बता दें कि यूक्रेन और रूस के बीच जंग को 2 साल से ज्यादा का समय बीत चुका है। इस जंग में अब तक हजारों की मौत और विस्थापित हो चुके हैं।",

In response, Russia's ambassador to the UN dismissed Trump's claim as false, stating that the war could have ended in April 2022, but Western countries, including the U.S., prevented it. The Russian ambassador, Nebenzia, accused Western nations of wanting the conflict to continue and criticized Ukrainian President Zelensky's participation in peace conferences as a joke. Trump has repeatedly made this claim since May 2023, asserting he would meet with both Zelensky and Russian President Putin to stop the war. He also blamed President Biden for escalating the conflict. The war, ongoing for over two years, has resulted in thousands of deaths and displacements."

        "summary": "The Indian government has decided to increase the windfall tax on crude petroleum from ₹3,250 per ton to ₹6,000 per ton, effective from July 2, 2024. The announcement was made on Monday evening through an official notification. Windfall tax is imposed on companies or industries that gain sudden and significant profits due to specific circumstances. In this case, Indian oil companies benefited from the surge in international crude oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Similar taxes have also been implemented by countries like Italy and the UK on their energy companies."

        "body": "हंगरी के प्रधानमंत्री विक्टर ओरबान ने एक नया दक्षिणपंथी राजनीतिक गठबंधन बनाने की घोषणा की है. \"पेट्रियट्स ऑफ यूरोप\" नाम का यह समूह ईयू की राजनीति में सबसे बड़ा दक्षिणपंथी समूह बनना चाहता है.\n\nइस गठबंधन में विक्टर ओरबान की धुर-दक्षिणपंथी राजनीति से जुड़ी फिडेज पार्टी, ऑस्ट्रिया फ्रीडम पार्टी (एफपीओ) और चेक रिपब्लिक की ऐक्शन ऑफ डिस्सटिस्फाइड सिटिजन्स (एएनओ) मूवमेंट साथ होंगे. इस समूह को \"पैट्रियट्स ऑफ यूरोप\" नाम दिया गया है. यह गठबंधन दक्षिणपंथी झुकाव वाले दलों और धुर-दक्षिणपंथी पार्टियों को साथ लेकर यूरोपीय संसद में बड़ा समूह बनने की कोशिश करेगा.\n\n30 जून को ऑस्ट्रिया की राजधानी वियना में एक प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस के दौरान ओरबान ने यह गठबंधन बनाने का मकसद बताते हुए कहा कि पैट्रियट्स ऑफ यूरोप \"यूरोपीय राजनीति में सबसे बड़ा दक्षिणपंथी समूह बनना चाहता है.\"\n\nफ्रांस में सत्ता के दरवाजे पर पहुंचे धुर दक्षिणपंथी\n\nइस प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस में ओरबान के साथ एफपीओ के नेता हेरबेर्ट किकल और एएनओ के नेता आंद्रे बाबिश भी मौजूद थे. बाबिश, चेक रिपब्लिक के प्रधानमंत्री भी रह चुके हैं. बाबिश की एएनओ पार्टी ने पिछले हफ्ते ही यूरोपीय संसद के यूरोप समर्थक विचारधारा वाले 'रीन्यू यूरोप' समूह से अलग होने का एलान किया था.\n\nगठबंधन ने अपना मकसद क्या बताया\n\nकिकल ने उम्मीद जताई कि यह गठबंधन यूरोपीय राजनीति में एक नया दौर है. उन्होंने समान विचारधारा वाले दूसरे राजनीतिक दलों को भी साथ आने का न्योता दिया. वहीं, बाबिश ने सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म एक्स पर लिखा \"आज हमने यूरोपीय संसद में एक नए गुट पेट्रियट्स ऑफ यूरोप का गठन किया. हम यूरोपीय राजनीति बदल देंगे, ताकि यह एक बार फिर देशों और हमारे लोगों के लिए काम करे. हम फेडरलिजम पर राष्ट्रीय संप्रभुता को, आदेश पर आजादी को, युद्ध पर शांति को वरीयता देंगे.\"\n\nसमाचार एजेंसी एएफपी के मुताबिक, वियना में नए गठबंधन की घोषणा करते हुए ओरबान ने कहा, \"यहां एक नया दौर शुरू हो रहा है, और इस नए दौर का शायद पहला निर्णायक क्षण एक नया यूरोपीय राजनीतिक धड़ा बनाना है, जो यूरोप की राजनीति को बदल देगा.\"\n\nइस कथित नए दौर को लाने का संकल्प करते हुए ओरबान, किकल और बाबिश ने एक घोषणापत्र पर दस्तखत किए, जिसे इन नेताओं ने \"पेट्रियोटिक मैनिफेस्टो\" बताया. इसमें युद्ध, माइग्रेशन और विकासहीनता की जगह शांति, सुरक्षा और विकास का वादा किया गया.\n\nयूरोपीय संसद के चुनाव में तीनों पार्टियों का अच्छा प्रदर्शन\n\nयूरोप में दक्षिणपंथ और धुर-दक्षिणपंथ के बढ़ते जनाधार के बीच फिडेज, एएनओ और एफपीओ ने हालिया यूरोपीय संसद के चुनाव में काफी अच्छा प्रदर्शन किया. फिडेज को अपने सहयोगी केडीएनपी के साथ मिलकर हंगरी में सबसे ज्यादा वोट मिले और इस गठबंधन ने 11 सीटें जीतीं. यूरोपीय संसद में हंगरी के हिस्से की कुल 21 सीटें हैं.\n\nयूरोपीय चुनाव: ऑस्ट्रिया में धुर-दक्षिणपंथी पार्टी को सफलता\n\nइसी तरह एएनओ को चेक रिपब्लिक में सबसे ज्यादा सात सीटें और एफपीओ को ऑस्ट्रिया में सबसे अधिक छह सीटें मिलीं. ऑस्ट्रिया में इस साल होने जा रहे राष्ट्रीय चुनावों में भी एफपीओ के जीतने की मजबूत संभावना है.\n\nयूरोपीय संसद में नया राजनीतिक समूह बनाने की शर्तें\n\nयूरोपीय संघ (ईयू) की संसद में 705 निर्वाचित सदस्य हैं. यूरोपीय संसद के सदस्य, जिन्हें 'मेंबर्स ऑफ दी यूरोपियन पार्लियामेंट' (एमईपी) कहते हैं, अपने-अपने देशों के मुताबिक नहीं, बल्कि राजनीतिक विचारधारा वाले समूहों में बैठते हैं.\n\nअभी यूरोपीय संसद में सात समूह हैं, जिनके नाम हैं: ग्रुप ऑफ दी यूरोपियन पीपल्स पार्टी (क्रिश्चियन डेमोक्रैट्स), ग्रुप ऑफ द प्रोग्रेसिव अलायंस ऑफ सोशलिस्ट्स एंड डेमोक्रैट्स, रीन्यू यूरोप ग्रुप, ग्रुप ऑफ द ग्रीन्स/यूरोपियन फ्री अलायंस, यूरोपियन कंजरवेटिव्स एंड रिफॉर्मिस्ट्स, आइडेंटिटी एंड डेमोक्रेसी ग्रुप और द लेफ्ट ग्रुप इन दी यूरोपियन पार्लियामेंट.\n\nकुछ सदस्य किसी भी राजनीतिक समूह से नहीं होते. इन्हें नॉन-अटैच्ड मेंबर्स कहते हैं. नया राजनीतिक समूह बनाने के लिए न्यूनतम 23 सदस्य चाहिए. पेट्रियट्स ऑफ यूरोप के पास यह संख्या तो है, लेकिन अभी उन्हें एक और शर्त पूरी करनी है.\n\nईयू के नियमों के मुताबिक, नया पॉलिटिकल ग्रुप बनाने के लिए समूह में सदस्य देशों की कम-से-कम एक तिहाई संख्या का प्रतिनिधित्व होना चाहिए. ईयू में 27 सदस्य हैं, यानी सात देशों से प्रतिनिधित्व की जरूरत है. ऐसे में पेट्रियट्स ऑफ यूरोप को कम-से-कम चार और देशों से निर्वाचित एमईपी साथ लाने की जरूरत है.\n\nऔर कौन सी पार्टियां साथ आ सकती हैं\n\nअनुमान है कि पोलैंड की दक्षिणपंथी लॉ एंड जस्टिस (पाआईएस) पार्टी भी पेट्रियट्स ऑफ यूरोप से जुड़ सकती है. बीते दिनों खबर आई कि पीआईएस, इटली की प्रधानमंत्री जॉर्जिया मेलोनी के 'यूरोपियन कंजरवेटिव्स एंड रीफॉर्मिस्ट्स' (ईसीआर) समूह से अलग होने पर विचार कर रही है. ईसीआर के सबसे बड़े घटक दलों में मेलोनी की ब्रदर्स ऑफ इटली के 24 यूरोपीय सांसद और पीआईएस के 20 सांसद हैं.\n\nजर्मनी की धुर-दक्षिणपंथी पार्टी ऑल्टरनेटिव फॉर जर्मनी (एएफडी) के भी पैट्रिअट्स ऑफ यूरोप से जुड़ने की संभावना है. एएफडी को हाल ही में यूरोपियन आइडेंटिटी एंड डेमोक्रेसी (आईडी) से निकाल दिया गया था. आईडी ने यह कदम यूरोपीय संसद का चुनाव लड़ रहे एएफडी के प्रमुख उम्मीदवार माक्सिमिलियन क्राह के रूस और चीन से कथित संबंधों सहित कई विवादों में घिरने के बाद लिया.\n\nएएफडी ने भी 30 जून को आईडी से निकलने की आधिकारिक घोषणा की. पार्टी के एक प्रवक्ता ने फिडेज के साथ जुड़ने की संभावनाओं पर कहा, \"भले ही एएफडी अभी फिडेज पार्टी के साथ संयुक्त संसदीय समूह ना बना सके, लेकिन यह एएफडी के अन्य दलों के साथ मिलकर काम करने के नए अवसर खोलता है, खासतौर पर जब ईसीआर और आईडी का पार्टी परिदृश्य लगातार बदल रहा हो.\"\n\nक्या जर्मनी की धुर दक्षिणपंथी पार्टी एएफडी लोकतंत्र के लिए खतरा है?\n\nछह महीने के लिए हंगरी रहेगा अध्यक्ष\n\n'काउंसिल ऑफ दी ईयू' की अध्यक्षता छह-छह महीने पर सदस्य देशों के बीच घूमती है. 1 जुलाई से यह प्रेसिडेंसी हंगरी को मिली है. वह 31 दिसंबर 2024 तक काउंसिल की अध्यक्षता करेगा. हंगरी से पहले बेल्जियम अध्यक्षता कर रहा था और अगली प्रेजिडेंसी पोलैंड को मिलेगी.\n\nहंगरी ने कहा है कि वह अपने इस कार्यकाल में \"यूरोप को फिर से महान बनाने\" के मकसद से काम करेगा और \"विजन ऑफ यूरोप\" को आगे बढ़ाएगा. हंगरी के प्रधानमंत्री विक्टर ओरबान का यह नारा पूर्व अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डॉनल्ड ट्रंप के \"मेक अमेरिका ग्रेट अगेन\" की याद दिलाता है.\n\nहंगरी ने काउंसिल की वेबसाइट पर अपने कार्यकाल की प्राथमिकताओं को रेखांकित करते हुए लिखा है, \"हमारा महादेश एक जैसी चुनौतियों का सामना कर रहा है. इसके कारण हैं, पड़ोस में चल रहा युद्ध, ईयू का अपने वैश्विक प्रतिद्वंद्वियों के मुकाबले पिछड़ते जाना, सुरक्षा की नाजुक स्थिति, गैरकानूनी माइग्रेशन, अंतरराष्ट्रीय सप्लाई चेन की अतिसंवेदनशीलता, प्राकृतिक आपदाएं, जलवायु परिवर्तन का असर और जनसंख्या से जुड़े रुझानों का असर.\"\n\n2024 को बदलाव की ओर बढ़ने का साल बताते हुए हंगरी ने यह भी कहा कि यूरोप को युद्ध, हथियारबंद संघर्ष, दुनिया में मानवीय संकट और उनके असर जैसी चुनौतियों के लिए तैयार रहना चाहिए.\n\nयूक्रेन और मोल्दोवा की सदस्यता पर फर्क पड़ेगा?\n\nहंगरी ने कहा है कि वह बतौर अध्यक्ष सात क्षेत्रों पर ध्यान देगा. ये थीम्स हैं: ईयू की प्रतिद्वंद्विता बढ़ाना, ब्लॉक की रक्षा नीति को मजबूत बनाना, ईयू में विस्तार की नीतियों को एकरूप और योग्यता आधारित बनाना, अवैध तरीके से होने वाले आप्रवासन को काबू करना, मजबूत एकता की नीति के भविष्य को आकार देना, किसान पर आधारित कृषि नीति को बढ़ावा देना और जनसंख्या से जुड़े बदलावों पर ध्यान देना.\n\nकई जानकार आशंका जता रहे हैं कि \"ईयू की एनलार्जमेंट पॉलिसी\" में कथित मेरिट और एकरूपता के माध्यम से हंगरी, यूक्रेन और मोल्दोवा की ईयू सदस्यता में अड़चन पैदा करने की कोशिश कर सकता है. हंगरी के पीएम विक्टर ओरबान, रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन के करीबी माने जाते हैं. यूक्रेन पर रूस के हमले के बाद भी उनकी पुतिन से नजदीकी कायम है.\n\nरूस, यूक्रेन और मोल्दोवा की ईयू सदस्यता को शंका से देखता है और इसका विरोध करता है. 2022 में यूक्रेन और मोल्दोवा के सदस्यता के लिए किए गए आवेदन के बाद से ही ओरबान इसमें अड़चन पैदा करते आए हैं. खबरों के मुताबिक, इन आशंकाओं के कारण ही हंगरी की अध्यक्षता शुरू होने से पहले 25 जून को यूक्रेन और मोल्दोवा की ईयू सदस्यता पर आधिकारिक वार्ता शुरू कर दी गई.\n\nपॉलिटिको की एक खबर के मुताबिक, ईयू के अधिकारी और यूक्रेन ने वार्ता प्रक्रिया पर सहमति बनाने के लिए हंगरी की सरकार को राजी करने पर काफी मेहनत की. ईयू के पांच अधिकारियों ने पहचान जाहिर ना करने की शर्त पर पॉलिटिको को बताया कि वे हर हाल में 25 जून से वार्ता शुरू करने की कोशिश कर रहे थे.",

The announcement was made during a press conference in Vienna, where Orbán was joined by FPÖ leader Herbert Kickl and former Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš.\n\nThe alliance seeks to reshape European politics by prioritizing national sovereignty over federalism, freedom over orders, and peace over war. The coalition performed well in recent European Parliament elections, with Fidesz winning 11 seats in Hungary, ANO securing 7 seats in the Czech Republic, and FPÖ obtaining 6 seats in Austria.\n\nTo form a new political group in the European Parliament, the alliance needs representatives from at least seven EU member states. Potential additions include Poland's Law and Justice Party (PiS) and Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD).\n\nHungary, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, aims to \"make Europe great again\" and focus on issues like illegal migration, security, and economic competitiveness. There are concerns that Hungary might obstruct Ukraine and Moldova's EU membership, given Orbán's close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin."

        "title": "नए सेना चीफ उपेंद्र द्विवेदी के सामने बहुत चुनौती, इस एरिया पर रहेगा फोकस",
        "body": "नई दिल्ली: देश को जनरल उपेंद्र द्विवेदी के तौर पर सेना का तीसवां प्रमुख मिला. 30 जून को उन्होंने अपना पदभार ग्रहण किया. उनकी ज़िम्मेदारी है जनल मनोज पांडे के काम को आगे बढ़ाना है, जिसमें सबसे पहले हैं भारतीय सेना को आत्मनिर्भर के तहत आधुनिकरण करना. रविवार को सेना प्रमुख का पदभार लेने के बाद सोमवार को थलसेना प्रमुख जनरल उपेंद्र द्विवेदी सबसे पहले नेशनल वॉर मेमोरियल पहुंचे और वीर शहीदों को श्रद्धांजलि दी. इसके बाद थलसेना प्रमुख को बतौर सेना प्रमुख साउथ ब्लॉक लॉन में गार्ड ऑफ आनर दिया गया.\n\nसेना के सर्व धर्म परम्परा के तहत धर्म ग़ुरूओं ने सेना प्रमुख जनरल उपेंद्र द्विवेदी को एक लकड़ी का बॉक्स सौंपते हुए शुभकामनाएं दी. लकड़ी का जो बॉक्स दिया जिसमें सर्व धर्म पुस्तक रखी गई थी जिसमें हिंदू, मुस्लिम, सिख, इसाई और बौद्ध धर्म ग्रंथ की प्रतियां थी. उस बॉक्स के उपर अग्रिम 18 लिखा था.\n\nपढ़ें- Parliament Session 2024 LIVE: राहुल के हिंदू वाले बयान पर लोकसभा में बवाल, BJP की मांग- माफी मांगे...\n\nचूंकि जनरल उपेंद्र द्विवेदी 18 जम्मू कश्मीर रायफ़ल्स में कमिशन हुए थे जो. बतौर सेना प्रमुख अपने पहले संबोधन में जनरल उपेंद्र द्विवेदी ने कहा कि मैं देश और भारतीय नागरिकों को विश्वास दिलाता हूं. कि भारतीय सेना हर चुनौतियों का सामना करने के लिए पूर्णतः सक्षम और तैयार है इसके अलावा उन्होंने मौजूदा वैश्विक हालातों और उसके बदलाव पर भी कहा कि आज वैश्विक समीकरण बदल रहे हैं.\n\nउन्होंने आगे कहा कि वर्तमान दौर की लड़ाईयां नया रूप ले रही है. हमें न केवल इस दिशा में अग्रसर रहने की ज़रूरत है बल्कि सैनिक को अत्याधुनिक हथियारों से लैस कर युद्ध पद्धति और रणनीति को बेहतर करने की ज़रूरत है. आज भारतीय थलसेना आधुनिकरण के पथ पर अग्रसर है. उस दिशा में आत्मनिर्भरता को पूर्णतः हासिल करने के लिए भारतीय सेना पूरी तरह से तैयार है और आत्मनिर्भरता को और ज़्यादा से ज़्यादा स्वदेशी वॉर सिस्टम को सेना में शामिल करेंगी. मेरी प्रयास रहेगा कि तीनों सेना के बीच सिनर्जी और समन्वय के साथ कॉफ्लिकट के समय में फुल स्पैक्ट्रम के साथ सदैव तत्पर रहे. इससे भारत के राष्ट्रहितों को सुरक्षित किया जा सकेगा और हम विकसित भारत 2047 के विकसित भारत की स्तंभ बन सकेंगे.\n\nचीन पाकिस्तान की साज़िशों से निपटना\n\nभारत एक दो पड़ोसी से घिरा है जो कि लगातार भारत के खिलाफ साज़िश रचते रहे हैं. हालांकि सीमाओं यानी की पाकिस्तान से लगती अंतरराष्ट्रीय सीमा, पीओके से लगती LOC और चीन के क़ब्ज़े वाले तिब्बत के से लगती LAC पर हालात फ़िलहाल शांत है लेकिन चुनौतियों अभी भी बनी हुई है. पाकिस्तान एक बार फिर से जम्मू कश्मीर में अशांति फैलाने के लिए आतंकी घटनाओं को अंजाम दे रहा है. कई साल से आंतकवादी गतिविधियों से शांत रहे जम्मू को फिर से एक्टिव किया गया और हमलों को बढ़ाया गया.\n\nबतौर नॉर्दर्न आर्मी कमॉडर सेना प्रमुख ने ज़मीनी हालात को बेहतर तरीके से महसूस किया है तो उनके सामने एक बाड़ी चुनौती होगा की जम्मू कश्मीर में आने वाले दिनों होने वाले विधानसभा चुनाव से पहले और उस दौरान पाकिस्तान की साज़िश को पूरी तरह से लगाम लगाना. जिस तरह से कश्मीर में सभी सुरक्षा एजेंसियों और लोकल इंटेलिजेंस के साथ मिलकर काम आतंकवाद का सिर कुचला उसी तर्ज़ पर इंटेलिजेंस को मज़बूत कर जम्मू में उठते इस आतंकवाद के फ़न को कुचलना होगा.\n\nवहीं चीन अब भी LAC के पास बना हुआ है उसे के चलते भारतीय सेना ने भी अपनी तौनाती को मिरर डेप्लायमेंट किया हुआ है. यानी जितनी तैनाती चीनी पीएलए की उतनी ही भारतीय सेना की. विषम परिस्थितियों और माइनस तापमान में भारतीय सैनिकों की तैनाती को साल भर चौबीस घंटे तैनात रखने के लिए पहले ही इंचजाम किए गए हैं और इसे लागातार बनाए रखने और सुविधाओं में किसी तरह की कमी न होने देना सबसे बड़ी प्राथमिकता होगी साथ ही तीनों कमांड यानी की पाकिस्तान से लगती वेस्टर्न कमांड और चीन से लगती नॉर्दर्न और इस्टर्न कमांड पर होगी.\n\nविकसित भारत 2047 तक सेना को आत्मनिर्भर बनाना\n\nअभी तक तो भारतीय सेना विदेशों से लिए गए हथियारों के ज़रिए अपनी सीमाओं की रक्षा करती रही है. लेकिन प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी के आत्मनिर्भर भारत के तहत सेना के आधुनिकीकरण को तेज़ी से आगे बढ़ाया जा रहा है. युद्ध जैसी स्थिति में हथियारों के लिए दूसरे देशों पर से निर्भरता कितना हानिकारक हो सकती है ये रूस यूक्रेन और इजरायल हमास की जंग से पता लग गया. भारतीय थलसेना के पास सबसे ज़्यादा हथियार सोवियत काल या उसके विघटन के बाद रूस और यूक्रेन वाले हैं और दोनों के बीच मौजूदा जारी जंग से ये सीख मिली कि आत्मनिर्भरता कितनी ज़रूरी है. क्योंकि इस जंग के चलते कई उपकरण और उनके पार्ट की सप्लाई बाधित हुई थी. थलसेना प्रमुख ने अपने संबोधन में ये साफ़ भी कर दिया उन्होंने कहा कि भारतीय थलसेना आधुनिकरण के पथ पर अग्रसर है उस दिशा में आत्मनिर्भरता को पूर्णतः हासिल करने के लिए भारतीय सेना पूरी तरह से तैयार है और आत्मनिर्भरता को और ज़्यादा से ज़्यादा स्वदेशी वॉर सिस्टम को सेना में शामिल करेंगी.\n\nअग्निपथ में बदलाव की चुनौती\n\nअग्निपथ का पहला बैच जनरल उपेंद्र द्विवेदी के सेना प्रमुख रहते हुए निकलेगा.\n\n2022 में सेना में भर्ती की प्रक्रिया बदली और अग्निपथ स्कीम के तहत अग्निवीरों की भर्ती हो रही है और अभी तक के प्रावधान के मुताबिक़ चार साल पूरा होने से पहले 25 पर्सेंट अग्निवीरों को परमानेंट होने का विकल्प दिया जाएगा, चूकी जिस दिन इस स्कीम को लागू किया गया तब ये बात भी रक्षा मंत्रालय की तरफ से कही गई थी कि समय समय पर इसको रिव्यू किया जाएगा और कोई परिवर्तन करना हो तो उसे भी किया जाएगा. अग्निपथ स्कीम को लागू हुए डेढ साल का वक्त हो चुका है और इन डेढ़ साल में इस स्कीम को रिव्यू किया जा रहा है. इस अग्निपथ स्कीम और अग्निवीर को लेकर राजनीति भी जारी है. लिहाजा पहले बैच के बाहर निकलने से पहले ही अगर कोई बदलाव किया तो वो किए जाने की चुनौती सेना प्रमुख पर भी होगी.\n\nनई तकनीक से सेना को लेस करना\n\nआज की लड़ाई तकनीक और क्रिटिकल एम्युनिशन पर आधारित है. जिसकी तकनीक सबसे बेहतर होगी युद्ध में उसका पलड़ा भारी रहेगा. चीन अपनी आधुनिक तकनीक से खुद को भी लेस कर रहा है और पाकिस्तान की ताक़त को भी बढ़ा रहा है. तो भारतीय सेना भी अपने को आधुनिक बाना रही है. अपने नॉर्दर्न कमांड के कमांडर के कार्यकाल के दौरान जनरल उपेंद्र द्विवेदी ने दुश्मन को मार गिराने के लिए नए सटीक आर्टलरी के गोले, कई तरह के आधुनिक ड्रोन, लॉयट्रिंग एम्यूनेशन, नेक्स्ट जेनरेशन बियॉन्ड द लाईन ऑफ़ साईट मिसाइल, एंटी-ड्रोन सिस्टम को सेना में शामिल मे काम करने की योजना पर काम किया. साथ ही हाई ऑलटिट्यूड में इस्तेमाल में लाए जाने वाले टैंक और अन्य उपकरणों को शामिल कर सेना को जल्द ताकतवर बनाने की योजना को तेज़ी से बढ़ाने के अपने काम को बतौर सेना प्रमुख आगे बढ़ाना है जितनी भी क्रिटिकल एम्युनिशन की ज़रूरत है और कमी है उसे आत्मनिर्भरता के तहत पूरा करना ज़िम्मेदारी होगी. इसके अलावा अपनी स्ट्रैटजिक सपोर्ट फोर्स यानी साइबर और स्पेस को भी रीस्ट्रक्चरिंग की प्रक्रिया के तहत मज़बूत करना होगी.",

        "title": "रूस ने यूक्रेन से जंग में क्यों उतार दीं मोटरसाइकिलें, नाटो भी रह गया हैरान",
        "body": "करीब ढ़ाई साल से ज्यादा समय से चल रहा रूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध अब एक नए रूप में पहुंच गया है। यूक्रेन द्वारा पूर्वी यूक्रेन में लगातार रूसी सैनिकों को ड्रोन और रॉकेटों के जरिए निशाना बनाया जा रहा था। जिसके कारण रूस को सैनिकों और बख्तरबंद वाहनों के रूप में काफी नुकसान का सामना करना पड़ रहा था। अब रूसी सेना ने खुले मैदानों में हमला करने के लिए एक नई तकनीकि का इजाद कर लिया है। यूक्रेनी सेना के लेफ्टिनेंट मिखाइलो होबित्सकी ने एक हमले का जिक्र करते हुए बताया ,\" पहले तो एकदम से धूल का गुबार उठा और फिर उसमें से मोटरसाईकिलों पर सवार रूसी सैनिक तेज रफ्तार में धूल उड़ाते, शोर करते सामने आए और चारों तरफ फैल कर उन्होंने यूक्रेनी मोर्चे को चारों तरफ से घेर लिया और गोलीबारी शुरू कर दी।\" मिखाइलो ने कहा कि इस तरह के हमले पहले से ही खतरनाक हो चुकी लड़ाई को और भी ज्यादा खतरनाक और उग्र बना दिया है।\n\nन्यूयॉर्क टाइम्स में छपी एक रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, यूक्रेनी अधिकारियों ने कहा कि पिछले महीनों में जितने भी हमले यूक्रेनी सैनिकों या मोर्चों पर हुए हैं उन में इन मोटरसाइकिल, बग्गी वाली गाड़ी के हमलें सबसे ज्यादा घातक रहे हैं, क्योंकि यह रूसी सैनिकों को लगातार तेजी के साथ खुले मैदान में चलने के लिए मदद करते हैं और उनके जिग-जैग तरीके से चलने के कारण ड्रोन या फिर किसी और तरह का हमला करना मुश्किल होता है। जबकि इसके मुकाबले बख्तरबंद गाड़ियों पर हमला करना आसान होता है क्योंकि वे तेजी से नहीं निकल सकती और एक सीधी दिशा में गति करती हैं।\n\nहर मीटर के लिए हो रही लड़ाई\n\nरिपोर्ट के अनुसार यूक्रेनी सेना के तोपखाने के कमांडर कैप्टन यारोस्लाव ने कहा,\" हम हर मीटर पर युद्ध लड़ रहे हैं, हम पिछले महीने रूस की सीमा में रॉकेट दाग रहे थे। रूस की सेना एक आक्रमक सेना है और जैसे-जैसे युद्ध आगे बढ़ रहा है इसके लाभ में भी वृद्धि हुई है। रूसी सेना की सबसे बड़ी मजबूती यह है कि वह पूर्वी यूक्रेन के डोनबास क्षेत्र में रणनीतिक रूप से महत्वपूर्ण आपूर्ति लाइनों और कस्बों के करीब है, जिससे उसे आपूर्ति की कोई कमी नहीं है। रूस ने मई 2023 में बखमुत शहर पर कब्जा कर लिया था, तब से वह एक साल में तीन मील तक आगे बढ़ गया है, रूस अब चासिव नहर के पास रूका हुआ है और यहां पर भी लगातार हमले कर रहा है।\n\nबमबारी से देता है कवर, फिर पीछे से आ जाते हैं बाइकर्स\n\nएक यूक्रेनी अधिकारी ने बताया कि रूसी सेना की तरफ से तेजी के साथ बमबारी की जाती है, जिससे यूक्रेनी सैनिकों को अपने मोर्चों में जाना पड़ता है। जिसमें बाहर निकलने पर रॉकेट का खतरा रहता है। इसके बाद रूसी सैनिक तेजी के साथ बाईक और बग्गी गाड़ियों पर सवार होकर आते हैं और सीधे ट्रेंच के ऊपर गोली बारी करना शुरू कर देते हैं। जिसके बाद लड़ाई वहां पर आमने-सामने की हो जाती है। यह मोटरसाईकिल और बग्गी गाड़ी बहुत तेज होती हैं और ड्रोन से बचने के लिए यह पेड़ों की लाईन में चलने की कोशिश करती हैं। रूस की सेना की इस नई योजना के कारण बहुत सारे यूक्रेनी सैनिकों को अपनी जान गवांनी पड़ी है। रूस ने इससे अपने कई बख्तरबंद वाहनों को बचा लिया है और लगातार सस्ती बाईक और बग्गी की मदद से यूक्रेन को काफी नुकसान पहुंचाया है।\n\nदरअसल, रूस और यूक्रेन के बीच पिछले ढ़ाई सालों से युद्ध चल रहा है, जिसमें यूक्रेन ने शुरुआत में रूस के बड़े-बड़े टैंकों और वाहनों को ड्रोन की मदद से मार गिराया था। इन हमलों में रूस को काफी नुकसान हुआ था। यूक्रेन का पूर्वी हिस्सा मैदानी है तो ऐसे में किसी भी सेना की कोई भी हरकत का पता आसानी से चल जाता था और उन पर हमला करना और भी आसान हो जाता था। यूक्रेन की इसी रणनीति का जवाब देने के लिए रूसी सेना ने मोटरसाइकिलों और बग्गी गाड़ियों का सहारा लेकर हमले की योजना बनाई है जिसके बाद यूक्रेनी सेना को इस लड़ाई में काफी नुकसान का सामना करना पड़ा है।",

        "summary": "The Russia-Ukraine war, ongoing for over two and a half years, has taken a new turn with Russia deploying motorcycles and buggies in combat. Ukrainian forces, particularly in eastern Ukraine, had been targeting Russian soldiers and armored vehicles with drones and rockets, causing significant losses for Russia. In response, Russia has adopted a new tactic involving fast-moving motorcycles and buggies to attack Ukrainian positions. Ukrainian Lieutenant Mykhailo Hobitsky described a recent attack where Russian soldiers on motorcycles surrounded and fired upon Ukrainian forces, making the conflict more dangerous and intense.\n\nAccording to a New York Times report, Ukrainian officials noted that these motorcycle and buggy attacks have been the most lethal in recent months. The vehicles' speed and zigzag movement make them difficult targets for drones and other attacks, unlike slower, more predictable armored vehicles. Ukrainian artillery commander Captain Yaroslav mentioned that the battle is fierce, with every meter being contested. Russia's strategic advantage lies in its proximity to supply lines in the Donbas region, allowing continuous resupply.\n\nA Ukrainian official explained that Russian forces use heavy bombardment to force Ukrainian soldiers into their trenches, followed by rapid attacks from soldiers on motorcycles and buggies, leading to close-quarters combat. This new Russian strategy has resulted in significant Ukrainian casualties and preserved many Russian armored vehicles. The use of motorcycles and buggies has allowed Russia to inflict considerable damage on Ukrainian forces, countering Ukraine's initial success in targeting larger Russian vehicles with drones."

        "body": "नई दिल्ली: उस एक गेंद के पहले बीती सारी बातें घूम गईं उसकी आंखों के सामने। वे सारे लोग जो उसके साथ खड़े थे और वे भी जो इंतजार कर रहे थे उसकी असफलता का। जीत के अलावा दूसरा कोई विकल्प नहीं था उसके सामने। भुवन जिस मनोभाव से गुजर रहा था वह आखिरी गेंद फेंके जाने से पहले, कुछ वैसी ही स्थिति रही होगी टीम इंडिया की। पूरा एक दशक, इस दरम्यान के तमाम फाइनल और सेमीफाइनल, एडिलेड-अहमदाबाद - इतिहास फिर से भूत बनकर आकार लेने लगा था। भुवन की तरह टीम इंडिया के पास भी बस एक ही विकल्प था, जीत।लगान वसूली\n\nफिल्म 'लगान' में आमिर खान के कैरेक्टर ने पूरे दम से बैट घुमाया। कैप्टन आंद्रे रसेल के पास मौका था कि वह गेंद लपक कर उस कहानी को वहीं खत्म कर देते। उन्होंने गेंद लपकी, पर अपनी सीमा को भूल गए। बाउंड्री पार कर गए। वही मौका सूर्यकुमार यादव के पास भी आया फील्डिंग करते समय। आखिरी ओवर, दक्षिण अफ्रीका का आखिरी बल्लेबाज, एक आखिरी मौका - सूर्या ने दिखाया कि क्यों SKY की लिमिट नहीं। लेकिन अपनी हद में रहकर। उनका उछलकर गेंद को लपकना, बाउंड्री के पार जाने से पहले गेंद को मैदान की ओर उछाल देना और फिर वापस मैदान में जाकर कैच पूरा करना हर एक लम्हा फ्रेम में मढ़कर रखने लायक है, जैसा कि 1983 विश्व कप में कपिल देव का लिया कैच और 2011 में महेंद्र सिंह धोनी का विनिंग शॉट।\n\nइंडिया का कैरेक्टर\n\n30 गेंदों पर 30 रन, विन प्रिडिक्टर ने भी साथ छोड़ दिया था टीम इंडिया का। ग्राफ कह रहा था कि भारत की जीत की उम्मीद चार फीसदी से भी कम है। लेकिन इस टीम के लिए इतनी उम्मीद भी काफी थी वापसी के लिए। पहले भी ऐसी सिचुएशन से आकर मुकाबले जीते गए हैं। दक्षिण अफ्रीका के कप्तान एडन मार्क्रम ने मैच के बाद यही कहकर तो खुद को सांत्वना दी। लेकिन इसी इवेंट में भारतीय खिलाड़ियों ने ऐसा कम से कम दो बार किया - पहले पाकिस्तान के खिलाफ और फिर फाइनल में। आखिरी वक्त तक उम्मीद का दामन नहीं छोड़ना और लड़े बिना हार नहीं मानना - यह केवल टीम इंडिया नहीं बल्कि पूरे इंडिया का कैरेक्टर दिखाता है।\n\nग्लोबल लीडर\n\nभारत इस जीत का हकदार था, विश्व विजेता कहलाने का हकदार था और केवल इस बार ही नहीं पिछले कई टूर्नामेंट से। वर्ल्ड टाइटल पहले ही आ जाना चाहिए था उसके पास। हालांकि कई बार जो होना चाहिए वह नहीं हो पाता। मेहनत और प्रतिभा होती है, फिर भी कहीं कुछ कमी रह जाती है। शायद किस्मत का थोड़ा-सा साथ, जिसकी कमी बार-बार मुस्कुराने का मौका छीन ले रही थी। लेकिन किस्मत कब तक दगा देती, उसे बहादुरों के साथ आना ही था। खेलों के बाहर, ग्लोबल मंच पर भी भारत को अपना अधिकार बिना लड़े कहां मिला है। कोरोना के दौर में जब दुनिया की अर्थव्यवस्था गिर रही थी, जब रूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध के कारण अनाज की कमी आ खड़ी हुई थी, जब यूरोप पर ईंधन का संकट छाया था - तब हर बार भारत ने अपनी भूमिका निभाई। वे छोटे-छोटे कदम थे, जिन्होंने हिंदुस्तान को ग्लोबल लीडर की श्रेणी में ला खड़ा किया।\n\nT20 World Cup Final में भारत की रोमांचक जीत, सांसे थाम देने वाले मैच में द.अफ्रीका को कैसे हराया ?\n\nकॉन्फिडेंस से भरपूर\n\nभारतीय क्रिकेट में वही आत्मविश्वास दिख रहा है, जो इस देश में है। जैसे-जैसे मुल्क ने अपना रास्ता बदला है, वैसे-वैसे हमारा खेल भी बदलता चला गया। 1991 में देश को अपना सोना तक गिरवी रखना पड़ा था। वह समय था आर या पार के फैसले का। अब तीन दशक बाद देखिए, भारत दुनिया की सबसे तेजी से आगे बढ़ती और पांचवें नंबर की अर्थव्यवस्था है। भारतीय केवल अपनी ही नहीं, कई दूसरे देशों की जीडीपी में भी योगदान दे रहे हैं। यही बदलाव आया है इंडियन क्रिकेट में भी। इन तीन दशकों ने भारत को क्रिकेट वर्ल्ड का लीडर बना दिया है। बिग थ्री की बात अब नहीं होती, अब केवल बिग वन है। जिस धमक के साथ हमारे राजनेता वैश्विक मंचों पर खड़े होते हैं, जिस आत्मविश्वास के साथ हमारे युवा मल्टिनैशनल कंपनियों को संभालते हैं, उसी धमक और आत्मविश्वास के साथ टीम इंडिया उतरती है मैदान पर।\n\nClarity और भरोसा\n\nजीत के बाद हजार मजबूतियां दिखने लगती हैं। फिर भी जो चीज इस टीम को अलग करती है, वह है क्लैरिटी। BCCI, टीम मैनेजमेंट और टीम - शुरू से आखिर तक इन सभी का रोल बिल्कुल स्पष्ट रहा। खिलाने वालों को पता था कि उन्हें क्या चाहिए और खेलने वालों को पता था कि क्या करना है। दूसरी बड़ी चीज रही भरोसा, ड्रेसिंग रूम में मौजूद हर एक शख्स का एक-दूसरे के ऊपर। जब प्रॉसेस सही हो, तो रिजल्ट की चिंता नहीं रहती और टीम को पता था कि सिलेक्शन प्रॉसेस सही है। उनका मेथड सही है, intention सही है। सभी ने अपने साथियों को बैक किया।\n\nखेल का भविष्य फाइनल देख रहे गूगल के CEO सुंदर पिचाई मुश्किल से सांसें ले पाए। वहीं, माइक्रोसॉफ्ट के चेयरमैन और सीईओ सत्या नडेला ने अमेरिका और वेस्टइंडीज में ज्यादा क्रिकेट खेलने की अपील की है। नडेला ने अमेरिका की मेजर क्रिकेट लीग (MCL) में पैसा लगाया हुआ है। क्रिकेट का अमेरिकी जमीन पर फलना-फूलना उनके अपने कारोबारी हित में भी है। इंटरनेशनल क्रिकेट काउंसिल भी यही चाहती है। लेकिन यहां भी अमेरिका को भारत की जरूरत पड़ेगी।",

However, the Indian team showcased resilience and determination, reminiscent of their past comebacks against Pakistan and in other crucial matches. Key moments included a spectacular fielding effort by Suryakumar Yadav, which was compared to historic cricket moments like Kapil Dev's 1983 catch and MS Dhoni's 2011 winning shot.\n\nThe victory highlighted India's character and confidence, reflecting the nation's broader economic and global leadership strides. The Indian cricket team's success is seen as parallel to India's rapid economic growth and increasing influence on the global stage. The clarity and trust within the team, along with a well-defined process by the BCCI and team management, were crucial to their success.\n\nThe match drew attention from global tech leaders like Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who emphasized the potential for cricket's growth in the USA. Nadella, who has invested in the Major Cricket League (MCL), sees the sport's expansion in America as beneficial for business, aligning with the International Cricket Council's (ICC) goals. However, the growth of cricket in the USA will likely require India's support."

The debate, held on November 5, saw Biden struggling, with moments of hesitation and difficulty countering Trump's accusations. This led to speculation in political circles and media that Biden might not be able to defeat Trump.\n\nThe New York Times editorial suggested Biden should step down for the country's sake, sparking further demands for his withdrawal. However, Biden and his campaign team have firmly stated that he will not back down. Top Democratic leaders, including Senator Raphael Warnock and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, have dismissed the idea of Biden withdrawing, emphasizing their support and focusing on preparing for the next debate in September.\n\nThe debate covered various critical issues such as the Israel-Hamas conflict, Russia-Ukraine war, U.S.-China relations, abortion, gun violence, taxes, inflation, unemployment, climate change, and illegal immigration. Biden criticized Trump for leaving behind a struggling economy, while Trump accused Biden's administration of allowing a surge in illegal immigration. Despite the debate's outcome, Democratic leaders believe Biden is still the best candidate to defeat Trump."

11 जून को जेएफ-17 थंडर के इजेक्शन सीट निर्माता मार्टिन बेकर ने ट्वीट किया। मार्टिन बेकर ने ट्वीट में लिखा, \"बुधवार, 5 जून को, पाकिस्तान वायु सेना का JF-17 ब्लॉक 2 विमान झंग जिले के पास दुर्घटनाग्रस्त हो गया। मार्टिन-बेकर PK16LE सीट का उपयोग करके पायलट ने सफलतापूर्वक इजेक्ट किया।\"\n\nजेएफ-17 कैसा लड़ाकू विमान है\n\nयूरेशियन टाइम्स की रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, जेएफ-17 सिंगल इंजन वाला, हल्का, मल्टीरोल लड़ाकू विमान है जिसे पाकिस्तान एयरोनॉटिकल कॉम्प्लेक्स और चीन के चेंगदू एयरक्राफ्ट इंडस्ट्री कॉरपोरेशन ने संयुक्त रूप से विकसित किया है। पाकिस्तान वायु सेना (पीएएफ) का यह लड़ाकू विमान 58% पाकिस्तान में और 42% चीन में निर्मित होता है। जेएफ-17 को पाकिस्तानी वायु सेना के बेड़े में फ्रांसीसी और चीनी तीसरी पीढ़ी के लड़ाकू विमानों के उत्तराधिकारी के रूप में माना गया था। इसे ए-5सी, एफ-7पी/पीजी, मिराज III और मिराज V की जगह लेने के लिए बनाया गया था।\n\nपाकिस्तान के पास कितने जेएफ-17 विमान\n\nआज की तारीख में, पाकिस्तान के पास लगभग 150 जेएफ-17 विमान सेवा में हैं। हालांकि, स्पुतनिक इंडिया में प्रकाशित एक रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, उनमें से एक महत्वपूर्ण हिस्सा अभी भी जमीन पर है। फ्लाइट सेफ्टी फाउंडेशन के एविएशन सेफ्टी नेटवर्क द्वारा प्रकाशित आंकड़ों के अनुसार, यह 13 साल की सेवा में चीन-पाकिस्तानी लड़ाकू विमान की 5वीं पुष्टि की गई दुर्घटना है। दूसरी ओर, JF-17 के भारतीय समकक्ष, लाइट कॉम्बैट एयरक्राफ्ट (LCA) तेजस को लगभग आठ वर्षों की सेवा में केवल एक दुर्घटना का सामना करना पड़ा है।\n\nJF-17 थंडर में क्या समस्याएं हैं\n\nइंजन का रखरखाव\n\nJF-17 में चीन द्वारा आपूर्ति किए गए RD-93 इंजन का उपयोग PAF के लिए गंभीर परिचालन संबंधी समस्याएं पैदा कर रहा है। 2023 में SP's एविएशन में प्रकाशित एक लेख के अनुसार, 40 JF-17 ब्लॉक 1 और 2 लड़ाकू विमानों को ग्राउंडेड किया गया और उन्हें उड़ान के लिए अयोग्य घोषित किया गया। गाइड वैन, एग्जॉस्ट नोजल और फ्लेम स्टेबलाइजर्स में काफी संख्या में इंजनों में दरारें आ गई थीं। यहां तक कि चीनी पीपुल्स लिबरेशन आर्मी एयर फ़ोर्स (PLAAF) ने भी इसे कई मोर्चों पर कमजोर पाया और इसे अपने बेड़े में शामिल नहीं किया।\n\nतेजस के मुकाबले फिसड्डी है जेएफ-17\n\n2021 में, एयर मार्शल अनिल चोपड़ा (सेवानिवृत्त) ने JF-17 के घटिया इंजन के बारे में बात करते हुए कहा कि भारत के LCA तेजस में उसके पाकिस्तानी समकक्ष की तुलना में कहीं अधिक विश्वसनीय इंजन है। इस प्रकार, PAF और चाइना नेशनल एयरो-टेक्नोलॉजी इम्पोर्ट एंड एक्सपोर्ट कॉरपोरेशन (CATIC) मॉस्को से सीधे सोर्स करके चीनी RD-93 इंजन को बदलना चाहते हैं। हालांकि, यह बदलाव उतना आसान नहीं है जितना लगता है। JF-17 थंडर में RD-93 इंजन का उपयोग किया गया है, जिसे आधिकारिक तौर पर रूसी इंजन निर्माता क्लिमोव द्वारा निर्मित किया जाता है। एक निश्चित संख्या में उड़ान घंटों के बाद, विमान के इंजनों को मूल उपकरण निर्माता (OEM) द्वारा नियमित रूप से बदला जाना चाहिए।\n\nजेएफ-17 के इंजन के पड़े लाले\n\nहालाँकि, रूस-यूक्रेन संघर्ष की शुरुआत के बाद से मूल उपकरण आपूर्तिकर्ता, 'JSC रोसोबोरोनएक्सपोर्ट' के खिलाफ पश्चिम द्वारा लगाए गए सख्त आर्थिक प्रतिबंधों के कारण ऐसी रखरखाव गतिविधियां बेहद बोझिल हो गई हैं। 2018 से, यह रूस में सभी सैन्य उपकरणों, प्रौद्योगिकी, दोहरे उद्देश्य वाले सामान, सेवाओं आदि के निर्यात और आयात के लिए एकमात्र राज्य-नियंत्रित फर्म रही है। स्वाभाविक रूप से, यह इस्लामाबाद और मॉस्को के बीच किसी भी सैन्य सहयोग को एक ऐसे पाकिस्तानी राज्य के लिए अत्यधिक अवांछनीय बनाता है जो पहले से ही अमेरिकी प्रतिबंधों के बढ़ते डर के कारण आर्थिक संकट से जूझ रहा है।\n\nअन्य तकनीकी खामियां और कमियां\n\nIAF ग्रुप कैप्टन डीके पांडे के विश्लेषण के अनुसार, JF-17 को एयर डिफेंस मिशन पर तैनात नहीं किया जा सकता है। इसके स्वदेशी रूप से विकसित लिंक-17 डेटा लिंक में पर्याप्त डेटा ट्रांसफर रेट नहीं है। लड़ाकू विमान की इंटरऑपरेबिलिटी सीमित है क्योंकि इसे पाकिस्तानी F-16 के लिंक-16 के साथ इंट्रीगेट नहीं किया जा सकता है। इसके अतिरिक्त, जेट में प्रभावी बियॉन्ड विजुअल रेंज (बीवीआर) या एयरबोर्न इंटरसेप्शन रडार नहीं है। 27 फरवरी, 2019 को ऑपरेशन स्विफ्ट रिटॉर्ट के दौरान भारतीय पायलट द्वारा प्रभावी जैमिंग के बाद जेएफ-17 के खराब प्रदर्शन ने इसकी सटीक स्ट्राइक क्षमता को गंभीर संदेह के घेरे में खड़ा किया है। पीएएफ के सभी रेंज एक्सटेंशन किट (आरईके) बम किसी भी महत्वपूर्ण लक्ष्य को हिट करने में विफल रहे।\n\nखराब प्रदर्शन\n\nपाकिस्तान को अपने JF-17 के लिए कई ग्राहक मिल गए हैं, जो नाइजीरिया और म्यांमार जैसे देशों को निर्यात किए जा रहे हैं। इसके अलावा, कथित तौर पर अजरबैजान और इराक के साथ सौदे अंतिम रूप से तय हो गए हैं। एविएशन इंडस्ट्री कॉरपोरेशन ऑफ चाइना (AVIC) के बयान के अनुसार, \"JF-17 को अंतर्राष्ट्रीय ग्राहकों और वैश्विक बाज़ार की ज़रूरतों को पूरा करने के लिए बनाया गया था। यह बयान साफ़ तौर पर दिखाता है कि ये लड़ाकू विमान घरेलू बाज़ारों के लिए नहीं बल्कि उन देशों के लिए थे जिन्हें कम लागत वाले, बहु-भूमिका वाले, हल्के, एकल इंजन वाले लड़ाकू विमान की ज़रूरत थी। इसे कभी भी अत्याधुनिक लड़ाकू विमान बनाने का इरादा नहीं था, बल्कि ऐसा होना चाहिए जो इस श्रेणी में उपलब्ध सबसे सस्ता विकल्प हो।\n\nजेएफ-17 को खरीद पछता रहा म्यांमार\n\nइरावडी टाइम्स की रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, पाकिस्तान के बाद JF-17 खरीदने वाला पहला देश म्यांमार तकनीकी खराबी के कारण अपने बेड़े को जमीन पर उतारने के लिए मजबूर हो गया। विश्लेषकों और म्यांमार वायु सेना के पूर्व पायलटों ने समाचार आउटलेट को बताया कि विमानों में संरचनात्मक दरारें और अन्य तकनीकी समस्याएं हैं। उन्होंने कहा, \"विमान, जो अवरोधन, जमीनी हमले और बमबारी मिशनों में सक्षम होने चाहिए, सेवा के लिए अनुपयुक्त साबित हुए हैं, और म्यांमार सेना के पास इस समस्या को ठीक करने के लिए तकनीकी विशेषज्ञता का अभाव है।\" उन्होंने आगे कहा कि JF-17 एवियोनिक्स का एक महत्वपूर्ण हिस्सा चीन निर्मित KLJ-7 AI रडार है, जिसकी सटीकता खराब है और इसके मेंटीनेंस से भी जुड़े मुद्दे हैं। विमान में घातक BVR मिसाइल और हवाई इंटरसेप्टर रडार का अभाव है।\n\nनाइजीरिया ने भी जेएफ-17 से मुंह मोड़ा\n\nनाइजीरिया ने 2016 में 3 जेएफ-17 की खरीद की थी। 2021 में नाइजीरियाई वायु सेना में कमीशन किए जाने के बाद से, इसे मुख्य रूप से उत्तर-पूर्वी नाइजीरिया में बोको हराम और इस्लामिक स्टेट से जुड़े लोगों के खिलाफ आतंकवाद और उग्रवाद विरोधी अभियानों में तैनात किया गया है। पाकिस्तान को नाइजीरिया से नया ऑर्डर मिलने की उम्मीद थी। लेकिन, नाइजीरियाई वायु सेना ने 24 M-346FA विमानों की खरीद के लिए इतालवी फर्म लियोनार्डो के साथ एक समझौते पर हस्ताक्षर किए, जो 4 बैचों में आने वाले हैं, जिनमें से पहला इस साल के अंत में आएगा।",

        "summary": "The JF-17 Thunder, a fighter jet jointly developed by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and China's Chengdu Aircraft Industry Corporation, has faced significant issues despite being praised by China and Pakistan. On June 5, 2024, a JF-17 Block 2 crashed in Punjab, Pakistan, marking the fifth crash in 13 years. The incident was confirmed by Martin-Baker, the ejection seat manufacturer, on June 11.\n\nThe JF-17, intended to replace older aircraft in the Pakistani Air Force, has about 150 units in service, though many are grounded due to maintenance issues, particularly with the Chinese-supplied RD-93 engines. These engines have shown significant operational problems, including cracks in critical components. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has further complicated maintenance due to sanctions on Russian military exports.\n\nThe aircraft also suffers from technical deficiencies, such as inadequate data transfer rates and poor radar performance, limiting its effectiveness in air defense missions. Despite these issues, Pakistan has exported the JF-17 to countries like Nigeria and Myanmar, though both have faced significant problems with the aircraft. Myanmar grounded its fleet due to structural and technical issues, while Nigeria opted for Italian M-346FA aircraft over additional JF-17s."

        "summary": "The article discusses the application of historical geopolitical concepts to current conflicts. It highlights that geopolitical changes are often accompanied by uncertainty, fear, insecurity, and bloodshed, but also bring new ideological constructs that shape strategic landscapes for decades or centuries. The article references the Thirty Years' War and the Peace of Westphalia, which introduced the concept of \"raison d'état\" (reason of state) by Cardinal Richelieu, emphasizing national interest over universal morality. It also discusses the balance of power concept, used by European politicians like Prince von Metternich to maintain harmony in Europe.\n\nThe article applies these historical concepts to modern conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war, where Russia's actions reflect \"raison d'état\" and balance of power concerns. Similarly, in the Israel-Hamas conflict, Israel's actions are seen as efforts to neutralize threats, albeit with significant violence. In the context of China, its aggressive stance and power play in the Indo-Pacific region are driven by realpolitik and economic growth, with counterbalances from groups like the Quad and AUKUS to prevent excessive Chinese influence.\n\nThe author, Manish Tewari, concludes that while circumstances and times change, fundamental geopolitical concepts remain relevant."

        "body": "कीव: यूक्रेन ने रूस में ड्रोन से हमला किया है जिसमें 5 लोगों की मौत की खबर सामने आ रही है। रूस के स्थानीय अधिकारियों ने शनिवार को कहा कि उसके देश के कुर्स्क क्षेत्र में यूक्रेन के ड्रोन हमले में कम से कम 5 लोगों की मौत हो गई। वहीं, दूसरी तरफ यूक्रेनी शहर डीनिप्रो में बचावकर्मी रूसी हमले में ध्वस्त हुई उस 9 मंजिला आवासीय इमारत का मलबा हटाते दिखे, जिसमें एक शख्स की मौत हो गई थी। गवर्नर एलेक्सी स्मिरनोव ने सोशल मीडिया पर कहा कि रूस-यूक्रेन सीमा पर गोरोडिशे गांव में यूक्रेनी हमले के पीड़ितों में 2 बच्चे भी शामिल हैं।\n\nक्षेत्रीय प्रमुख सेरही लिसाक ने कहा कि डीनिप्रो में शुक्रवार शाम रूसी हमले के बाद एक इमारत की ऊपरी 4 मंजिलें नष्ट होने के बाद कम से कम एक व्यक्ति की मौत हो गई और 7 महीने की बच्ची सहित 12 लोग घायल हो गए। लिसाक ने कहा कि ये हमले उस वक्त हुए जब रूस ने 1,000 किलोमीटर (600 मील) के मोर्चे पर कई क्षेत्रों में अपनी सेना को तैनात करना जारी रखा है। मॉस्को ने यूक्रेन के संसाधनों को खत्म करने के लिए हवाई हमले तेज कर दिए हैं और अक्सर ऊर्जा उत्पादन के केंद्रों और अन्य महत्वपूर्ण बुनियादी ढांचे को निशाना बनाया जाता है।\n\nइस बीच यूक्रेन के राष्ट्रपति वोलोदिमीर जेलेंस्की ने कहा कि रूसी हमलों के कारण देश ने अपनी लगभग 80 फीसदी तापीय ऊर्जा क्षमता और एक तिहाई जलविद्युत क्षमता खो दी है। डीनिप्रो में हुए हमले पर चर्चा करते हुए जेलेंस्की ने कहा कि यह यूक्रेन के सहयोगियों के लिए एक चेतावनी है कि देश को और भी ज्यादा एयर डिफेंस सिस्टम की जरूरत है। यूक्रेनी वायुसेना ने शनिवार को कहा कि उसने रातभर में 10 रूसी ड्रोन मार गिराए हैं। बता दें कि महीनों से जारी इस लड़ाई में दोनों ही पक्षों को काफी नुकसान हुआ है लेकिन यूक्रेन की हालत ज्यादा खराब हुई है।",

        "body": "अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति जो बाइडेन और उनके रिपब्लिकन प्रतिद्वंद्वी तथा पूर्व राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप के बीच शुक्रवार को पहली प्रेसिडेंशियल डिबेट हुई. दोनों नेताओं ने इस दौरान एक-दूसरे पर जमकर निशाना साधा. इस डिबेट के बाद राष्ट्रपति बाइडेन ने कहा कि उनका इरादा नवंबर के राष्ट्रपति चुनाव में रिपब्लिकन प्रतिद्वंद्वी डोनाल्ड ट्रंप को हराने का है.\n\nट्रंप ने इस बात का कोई संकेत नहीं दिया कि डिबेट में कमजोर प्रदर्शन करने और वे डेमोक्रेट्स समर्थकों को निराश करने के बावजूद वह दौड़ से बाहर होने पर विचार करेंगे.\n\nबाइडेन ने शेयर किया अपना वीडियो\n\nअपने रिपब्लिकन प्रतिद्वंद्वी के साथ आमने-सामने की बहस के एक दिन बाद एक रैली को संबोधित करते हुए बाइडेन ने कहा, \"मुझे पता है कि मैं एक युवा व्यक्ति नहीं हूँ. मैं पहले की तरह आसानी से नहीं चलता, मैं पहले की तरह सहजता से नहीं बोलता, मैं पहले की तरह अच्छी तरह से बहस नहीं करता.\" जैसे ही बाइडेन ने ये बात कही तो उनके समर्थकों ने \"चार और साल\" के नारे लगाने शुरू कर दिए.\n\nये भी पढ़ें: 'डोनाल्ड ट्रंप हमारे लोकतंत्र के लिए खतरा', बोले राष्ट्रपति बाइडेन, नॉर्थ कैरोलिना में किया प्रचार\n\nबाइडेन ने अपना वीडियो एक्स पर पोस्ट करते हुए कहा, 'दोस्तों, मैं शायद पहले की तरह आसानी से न चल पाऊँ या न ही उतनी सहजता से बात कर पाऊँ. हो सकता है कि मैं पहले की तरह बहस न कर पाऊँ.लेकिन मैं सच बोलना जानता हूँ.'\n\nअटकलों पर लगाया विराम\n\nबाइडेन ने कहा, 'अगर मेरा दिल या आत्मा ये कहती कि मैं यह काम नहीं कर सकता हूँ, तो मैं फिर से चुनाव नहीं लड़ता.' दरअसल डिबेट में जिस तरह से बाइडेन कई बार अटकते हुए नजर आए उससे लोगों में यह संदेश भी गया है कि कि वह एक बार फिर से चार साल का कार्यकाल पूरा करने के लिए फिट नहीं हो सकते हैं. उनके कुछ साथी डेमोक्रेट्स ने कुछ इसी तरह के सवाल उठाए हैं.\n\nचुनावी अभियान के प्रवक्ता माइकल टायलर ने कहा कि इस संभावना के बारे में कोई बातचीत नहीं हो रही है. उन्होंने एयर फ़ोर्स वन में सवार पत्रकारों से कहा, \"हम एक खराब रात को ऐसे उम्मीदवार से बेहतर मानते हैं, जिसका देश को लेकर नज़रिया खराब हो.\"\n\nडिबेट में लड़खड़ाते हुए नजर आए बाइडेन\n\nशुक्रवार को हुई डिबेट के दौरान 78 वर्षीय ट्रम्प ने कई झूठ बोले, लेकिन इसके बाद भी पूरा ध्यान बाइडेन पर पर केंद्रित हो गया, खासकर डेमोक्रेट्स के बीच. अमेरिकी प्रतिनिधि सभा में डेमोक्रेटिक पार्टी के नेता हकीम जेफ्रीस से जब पूछा गया कि क्या उन्हें अभी भी बाइडेन की उम्मीदवारी पर भरोसा है, तो उन्होंने सीधे जवाब देने से परहेज कर दिया.\n\nडेमोक्रेटिक पार्टी के नेता हकीम जेफ्रीस ने कहा, 'मैं टिकट का समर्थन करता हूँ. मैं सीनेट डेमोक्रेटिक बहुमत का समर्थन करता हूँ. हम नवंबर में सदन में वापसी के लिए हर संभव प्रयास करने जा रहे हैं. आप सभी का धन्यवाद.' इसी तरह कुछ अन्य डेमोक्रेट्स ने भी इस बात पर आपत्ति जताई कि क्या बाइडेन को दौड़ में बने रहना चाहिए. डेमोक्रेटिक सीनेटर जैक रीड ने रोड आइलैंड के एक स्थानीय टीवी से बात करते हुए कहा, \"यह राष्ट्रपति का फैसला है.\"\n\nये भी पढ़ें: 64 साल पुरानी वो प्रेसिडेंशियल डिबेट जिसने बदल दिया था US का इतिहास, क्या बढ़ जाएगी बाइडेन की चिंताएं?\n\nपूर्व राष्ट्रपति खुलकर कर रहे हैं समर्थन\n\nलेकिन पार्टी के कई वरिष्ठ नेताओं, जिनमें पूर्व राष्ट्रपति बिल क्लिंटन और बराक ओबामा शामिल हैं, ने कहा कि वे बाइडेन समर्थन में उनके साथ खड़े हैं और खड़े रहेंगे. बराक ओबामा ने एक्स पर पोस्ट करते हुए लिखा, \"बुरी बहस की रातें होती हैं. मेरा विश्वास करो, मुझे पता है. लेकिन यह चुनाव अभी भी एक ऐसे व्यक्ति के बीच का चुनाव है जिसने अपने पूरे जीवन में आम लोगों के लिए लड़ाई लड़ी है और एक ऐसा व्यक्ति जो केवल अपने बारे में परवाह करता है.\"\n\nन्यूयॉर्क टाइम्स के संपादकीय बोर्ड, जिसने 2020 में बाइडेन का समर्थन किया था, ने डेमोक्रेटिक पार्टी से अपील की है कि वे किसी अन्य उम्मीदवार को चुनकर ट्रम्प को हराने का बेहतर मौका दें. संपादकीय में कहा गया, \"बाइडेन अब जो सबसे बड़ी सार्वजनिक सेवा कर सकते हैं वह यह है कि उन्हें घोषणा करनी चाहिए कि वह फिर से चुनावी दौड़ में शामिल नहीं हैं.'\n\nबाइडेन ने चुनावी अभियान के तहत गुरुवार और शुक्रवार को 14 मिलियन डॉलर जुटाए. वहीं ट्रम्प के चुनावी अभियान ने कहा कि उसने बहस की रात को 8 मिलियन डॉलर जुटाए. बाइडेन के लिए अच्छी बात ये है कि डिबेट का जो प्रारंभिक दर्शक डेटा सामने आया है उससे पता चला है कि केवल 48 मिलियन अमेरिकियों ने डिबेट देखी, जो 2020 में उम्मीदवारों के अंतिम डिबेट को देखने वाले 73 मिलियन से बहुत कम है. बाइडेन अमेरिकी इतिहास में सबसे उम्रदराज अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति हैं.\n\nये भी पढ़ें: 'बाइडेन सबसे खराब राष्ट्रपति, हम खत्म कराएंगे रूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध', अमेरिका के चेसापीक में बोले डोनाल्ड ट्रंप\n\nअगर बाइडेन उम्मीदवारी से पीछे हट जाते हैं, तो पार्टी के पास 19 अगस्त से शुरू होने वाले अपने राष्ट्रीय सम्मेलन में किसी अन्य उम्मीदवार को चुनने के लिए दो महीने से भी कम समय होगा . उनकी जगह कई नाम सामने आ रहे हैं जिनमें पहली अश्वेत महिला उपराष्ट्रपति कमला हैरिस का नाम भी शामिल है.\n\nट्रंप का बाइडेन पर हमला\n\nवर्जीनिया के चेसापीक में दोपहर की रैली में ट्रंप ने समर्थकों से कहा \"मुझे हमारे देश को नष्ट करने की कोशिश कर रहे एक व्यक्ति के खिलाफ बड़ी जीत मिली है.\" ट्रंप के सलाहकारों ने कहा कि उन्हें लगता है कि इस बहस से वर्जीनिया जैसे डेमोक्रेटिक झुकाव वाले राज्यों में उनकी संभावनाओं को बल मिलेगा, जिसने 2004 के बाद से किसी रिपब्लिकन राष्ट्रपति पद के उम्मीदवार का समर्थन नहीं किया है.",

Post-debate, Biden expressed his determination to defeat Trump in the upcoming November election, despite acknowledging his own physical and verbal limitations due to age. Biden's performance raised concerns among some Democrats about his fitness for another term, though key figures like former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama continue to support him. The debate's viewership was significantly lower than in 2020, with only 48 million viewers. Trump, meanwhile, claimed a significant victory and suggested the debate could boost his chances in traditionally Democratic states like Virginia."

        "body": "प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी ने भारत को जी-20 देशों के समूह से बाहर निकालने की धमकी दी थी। इस बात का खुलासा भारत के जी-20 शेरपा अमिताभ कांत ने अपनी किताब 'पावर विदिन: द लीडरशिप लिगेसी ऑफ नरेंद्र मोदी' के विमोचन के दौरान किया है। नीति आयोग के पूर्व सीईओ ने प्रधानमंत्री मोदी से जुड़े कई निजी किस्से याद किए।\n\nउन्होंने कहा, \"भारत में 2023 जी-20 शिखर सम्मेलन के दौरान हम रूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध का सामना कर रहे थे। 300 घंटे की बातचीत हुई और 16 मसौदे शामिल किए गए। प्रधानमंत्री को हर दो घंटे में रिपोर्ट मिल रही थी।\" उन्होंने कहा कि भारत ने अंतिम क्षण में भी अमेरिका और चीन के तनावपूर्ण संबंधों के कारण उनकी मांगों को संतुलित किया।\n\nउन्होंने खुलासा करते हुए कहा, \"प्रधानमंत्री सुबह करीब आठ बजे भारत मंडपम आए। मैं बैठक की प्रक्रिया का विवरण दे रहा था। उन्होंने मुझे बीच में ही रोककर संयुक्त घोषणा के बारे में पूछा। मैंने उन्हें सारी जानकारी दी। प्रधानमंत्री स्पष्ट थे। वे आम सहमति चाहते थे। अन्यथा भारत उसी दिन जी-20 से बाहर हो जाता।\"\n\nउन्होंने यह भी बताया कि संयुक्त घोषणा से दो घंटे पहले कुछ अड़चनें थीं। लेकिन भारत उन्हें दूर करने में कामयाब रहा। अमिताभ कांत ने कहा कि यह सिर्फ़ प्रधानमंत्री के कद और प्रतिष्ठा की वजह से संभव हुआ।\n\nपीरामल समूह के अजय पीरामल ने इस दौरान बताया कि 2013 में जब नरेंद्र मोदी को भाजपा के प्रधानमंत्री पद के उम्मीदवार के रूप में घोषित किया गया था, तो उन्होंने भारत की वित्तीय स्थिति और आगे बढ़ने के आदर्श तरीके के बारे में जानने के लिए अर्थशास्त्रियों और उद्योग विशेषज्ञों के साथ पांच घंटे की मैराथन बैठक की थी। इस पांच घंटे के दौरान कई लोगों ने ब्रेक लिया, वहीं मोदी ने नहीं लिया।\n\nडिजिटल पेमेंट पर पीएम\n\nअमिताभ कांत ने एक और किस्सा सुनाया कि किस तरह भारत की डिजिटल भुगतान प्रणाली आज इस मुकाम पर पहुंची है। उन्होंने कहा, \"नोटबंदी के बाद मुझे प्रधानमंत्री का फोन आया और उन्होंने कहा, 'डिजिटल भुगतान को आगे बढ़ाएं'। उन्होंने हमें 100 दिनों में 100 शहरों में 100 डिजिटल मेले आयोजित करने के लिए कहा। लेकिन यह बेहद कठिन था। मैंने स्लाइड शो के दौरान प्रधानमंत्री से इस पर पुनर्विचार करने का तीन बार अनुरोध किया। हर बार उन्होंने सुनने से इनकार कर दिया। आज हम जितने डिजिटल लेन-देन करते हैं, वह 100 दिनों में 100 शहरों में 100 डिजिटल मेले आयोजित करने पर उनके आग्रह के कारण है। यह उनका विजन है।\"\n\nअजय पीरामल ने कहा, \"किसी भी प्रधानमंत्री के पास चिंता करने के लिए बहुत सी चीजें होती हैं। लेकिन वह भारत के 112 सबसे कम विकसित जिलों के बारे में सोच रहे थे और उन्हें ऊपर उठा रहे थे। यही नेतृत्व है।\"\n\nआईआईएम बैंगलोर के प्रोफेसर बी महादेवन ने गीता से उदाहरण उधार लेते हुए नेतृत्व की गुणवत्ता पर बात की। उन्होंने कहा, \"मैं अक्सर यह बताता हूं कि अर्जुन एक नेता के रूप में असफल क्यों हुआ, क्योंकि वह अंदर से असफल था। यह पुस्तक उस पहलू के बारे में बात करती है।\"",

राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप का प्रदर्शन बेहतर रहा। यह वर्ष 2020 की उस स्थिति के उलट है, जब बहस देखने वालों ने 81 वर्षीय डेमोक्रेट (बाइडन) को उनके रिपब्लिकन प्रतिद्वंद्वी ट्रंप के मुकाबले बेहतर उम्मीदवार के रूप में देखा था।\n\nव्हाइट हाउस में दूसरा कार्यकाल पाने के इच्छुक बाइडन बहस के दौरान लड़खड़ाते नजर आए जिससे डेमोक्रेट के शीर्ष नेताओं के बीच इस बात को लेकर खतरे की घंटी बज गई है कि क्या मौजूदा राष्ट्रपति अमेरिका में राष्ट्रपति चुनाव से पहले के कठिन महीनों के दौरान शीर्ष पर रह सकते हैं।\n\nपांच नवंबर को होने वाले चुनाव को लेकर दोनों नेताओं के बीच बृहस्पतिवार को करीब 90 मिनट तक आक्रामक बहस हुई।\n\nइस दौरान अर्थव्यवस्था, आव्रजन, विदेश नीति, गर्भपात और राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा को लेकर राष्ट्रपति बाइडन और रिपब्लिकन पार्टी की ओर से राष्ट्रपति पद के भावी उम्मीदवार माने जा रहे 78-वर्षीय ट्रंप के बीच वार-पलटवार देखने को मिला। दोनों नेताओं ने एक दूसरे को झूठा और अमेरिका के इतिहास का सबसे खराब राष्ट्रपति करार दिया।\n\nट्रंप ने कहा, ''हम एक तीसरी दुनिया के देश जैसे हैं और यह शर्म की बात है। अब हमारा सम्मान नहीं किया जाता।''\n\nअटलांटा स्थित सीएनएन मुख्यालय में उच्च स्तरीय बहस में काफी आश्वस्त दिख रहे ट्रंप ने गर्भपात से लेकर करों और घाटे तक के झूठ को भी दोहराया। लेकिन वह इस सवाल का जवाब देने से बचते रहे कि क्या वह 2024 के चुनाव परिणाम को स्वीकार करेंगे।\n\nट्रंप ने देश की समस्याओं को मैक्सिको के साथ लगती दक्षिण-पश्चिमी अमेरिकी सीमा पार करने वाले प्रवासियों की आमद से भी जोड़ा और कहा कि वे अमेरिकी अर्थव्यवस्था को नुकसान पहुंचा रहे हैं।\n\nट्रंप ने व्हाइट हाउस में अपने 2017-2021 के कार्यकाल के बारे में कहा, ''हमारे पास दुनिया की सबसे सुरक्षित सीमा थी। लेकिन अब यह दुनिया की सबसे खतरनाक जगह है।''\n\nट्रंप के बयान के जवाब में बाइडन ने कहा, ''वह बढ़ाचढ़ाकर बता रहे हैं, वह झूठ बोल रहे हैं।'' बाइडन ने रेखांकित किया कि अब पहले के मुकाबले 40 फीसदी कम प्रवासी सीमा पार करके अमेरिका में प्रवेश कर रहे हैं क्योंकि उन्होंने हाल ही में अमेरिका में प्रवेश को लेकर सख्त पाबंदी लागू की है।\n\nबाइडन ने ट्रंप को मूर्ख और हारा हुए व्यक्ति करार दिया।\n\nउम्र के मुद्दे पर बाइडन ने ट्रंप को याद दिलाया कि वह उनसे सिर्फ तीन साल छोटे हैं। 81 साल के बाइडन अमेरिकी इतिहास के सबसे उम्रदराज राष्ट्रपति हैं।\n\nट्रंप ने बाइडन को अपराधी कहा क्योंकि बाइडन ने उन्हें न्यूयॉर्क के 'हश मनी' मामले में दोषी ठहराए जाने का जिक्र करते हुए 'सजायाफ्ता अपराधी' कहा था। 'हश मनी' से आशय किसी को मुंह बंद रखने के लिए या अन्य उद्देश्य से उसे अनुचित और गोपनीय रूप से दिये गये धन से है।\n\nबाइडन ने ट्रंप पर आरोप लगाया कि वह नहीं जानते कि वह क्या कह रहे हैं।\n\nउन्होंने ट्रंप की नैतिकता पर सवाल उठाते हुए कहा, ''सार्वजनिक रूप से एक महिला के साथ छेड़छाड़ करने, एक पोर्न स्टार के साथ यौन संबंध बनाने, जब आपकी पत्नी गर्भवती थी, और भी कई तरह के काम करने लिये आपके ऊपर कितने अरब डॉलर का नागरिक दंड बकाया है। आप किस बारे में बात कर रहे हैं?''\n\nट्रंप ने यूक्रेन को 200 अरब डॉलर से अधिक की राशि दिये जाने को लेकर भी सवाल उठाया और कहा कि इतना अधिक पैसा रूस-यूक्रेन पर खर्च नहीं करना चाहिए था।\n\nट्रंप ने कहा कि वह 20 जनवरी को पदभार ग्रहण करने से पहले निर्वाचित राष्ट्रपति के रूप में पुतिन और जेलेंस्की के बीच युद्ध को सुलझा लेंगे, इसके जवाब में बाइडन ने रूस के राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन को युद्ध अपराधी करार दिया।\n\nउपराष्ट्रपति कमला हैरिस ने स्वीकार किया कि बाइडन ने 'धीमी शुरुआत' की। हैरिस ने सीएनएन को दिये एक एक साक्षात्कार में कहा, ''आज रात हमने जो देखा वह यह है कि राष्ट्रपति ने अमेरिकी लोगों के लिए मायने रखने वाले सभी मुद्दों पर डोनाल्ड ट्रंप के सापेक्ष स्पष्ट रूप से विरोधाभास दिखाया। हां, शुरुआत धीमी रही पर अंत मजबूत था।''\n\nयह बहस तब हुई जब बाइडन और ट्रंप को उनकी पार्टियों की ओर से राष्ट्रपति पद के लिए आधिकारिक उम्मीदवार घोषित नहीं किया गया है। रिपब्लिकन अपने राष्ट्रपति उम्मीदवार के चुनाव के लिए 15 से 18 जुलाई तक विस्कॉन्सिन के मिल्वौकी में सम्मेलन बुलाएंगे, जबकि डेमोक्रेट 19 अगस्त को शिकागो में सम्मेलन आयोजित करेंगे।\n\nएसएसआरएस की ओर से आयोजित 'सीएनएन फ्लैश सर्वेक्षण' के अनुसार, बहस देखने वाले पंजीकृत लोगों में से 67 प्रतिशत से 33 प्रतिशत ने कहा कि ट्रंप ने बेहतर प्रदर्शन किया। राष्ट्रपति पद की तीन बहसों में से पहली बहस अटलांटा में हुई, जिसकी मेजबानी सीएनएन ने की।\n\nबहस से पहले उन्हीं मतदाताओं (55 प्रतिशत से 45 प्रतिशत) ने कहा कि उन्हें उम्मीद है कि बाइडन के मुकाबले ट्रंप बेहतर प्रदर्शन करेंगे।\n\nसीएनएन की ओर से कहा गया कि सर्वेक्षण के नतीजे केवल उन मतदाताओं के बीच बहस के प्रति राय को प्रतिबिंबित करते हैं जो इसमें शामिल हुए हैं और यह पूरी मतदान करने वाली समस्त जनता के विचारों का प्रतिनिधित्व नहीं करता है।\n\nसर्वेक्षण में बहस पर नजर रखने वालों में डेमोक्रेटिक-गठबंधन की तुलना में रिपब्लिकन-गठबंधन की संभावना पांच अंक अधिक थी।\n\nसीएनएन की रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, ये नतीजे वर्ष 2020 की उस स्थिति से अलग हैं, जब बहस पर नजर रखने वालों ने राष्ट्रपति पद की बहस में बाइडन को ट्रंप से बेहतर बताया था।\n\nअमेरिका में बृहस्पतिवार रात बहस देखने वालों में से 57 प्रतिशत लोगों ने कहा कि उन्हें देश का नेतृत्व करने के लिहाज से उन्हें बाइडन की क्षमता पर असल में कोई भरोसा नहीं है, और 44 प्रतिशत ने कहा कि उन्हें ऐसा करने के लिहाज से ट्रंप की क्षमता पर असल में कोई भरोसा नहीं है।\n\nरिपोर्ट में कहा गया है कि बहस पर नजर रखने वालों में से केवल 36 प्रतिशत का कहना है कि उन्हें देश का नेतृत्व करने के लिहाज से ट्रंप की क्षमता पर बहुत भरोसा है, लेकिन बाइडन के बारे में इस तरह की बात केवल 14 फीसदी ने कही।\n\nसीएनएन का यह सर्वेक्षण उन 565 पंजीकृत अमेरिकी मतदाताओं पर आधारित है, जिन्होंने बृहस्पतिवार को बहस देखने की बात स्वीकार की। इस सर्वेक्षण को लिखित संदेश के जरिये किया गया।\n\nभाषा संतोष सुरेश संतोष रंजन",

This contrasts with the 2020 debates where Biden was seen as the stronger candidate. The 90-minute debate covered topics such as the economy, immigration, foreign policy, abortion, and national security. Trump criticized Biden's handling of the U.S. border and economy, while Biden accused Trump of lying and questioned his moral integrity. A CNN flash survey indicated that 67% of viewers thought Trump performed better. The debate raised concerns among Democratic leaders about Biden's ability to lead in the upcoming election. Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged Biden's slow start but emphasized his strong finish. The debate took place before either candidate was officially nominated by their respective parties."

        "body": "2024 US Presidential Election के आख़िरी चरण की पहली बाज़ी हो गई. डेमोक्रैटिक प्रतिनिधि और अमेरिका के राष्ट्रपति जो बाइडन (Joe Biden) बनाम रिपब्लिकन दावेदार व पूर्व-राष्ट्रपति डॉनल्ड ट्रंप (Donald Trump) की राष्ट्रपति बहस (Presidential Debate).\n\nबहस के बाद ऐनालिसिस किया जा रहा है. ट्रंप के समर्थक तो राज़ी हैं. पॉलिटिकली करेक्ट होने के ऊपर बोल देने को तरजीह देते हैं. लेकिन राजनीतिक स्पेक्ट्रम के दोनों पक्षों के टिप्पणीकार राष्ट्रपति बाइडन के 'ख़राब प्रदर्शन' के लिए उनकी आलोचना कर रहे हैं. डेमोक्रैट्स के बीच ये खुस-फुस है कि ट्रंप के ख़िलाफ़ बाइडन अब सही दावेदार नहीं हैं और उन्हें हट जाना चाहिए.\n\nअर्थव्यवस्था, इमिग्रेशन, पब्लिक सेफ्टी, गाज़ा में चल रही जंग, रूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध, गर्भपात क़ानून, चीन-ताइवान विवाद. अपेक्षा थी कि इन मसलों पर चर्चा होगी, और हुआ भी यही.\n\nबहस के दौरान कई ऐसे मौक़े भी आए, जहां एक-दूसरे के लिए दोनों की असल भावनाएं बाहर बह आ रही थीं. दोनों ने एक-दूसरे को इतिहास का सबसे ख़राब राष्ट्रपति बताया. बाइडन ने ट्रंप को 'हारे हुए' और 'शिकायती' कहा, तो ट्रंप ने बाइडन को 'विपत्ति' ही बता दिया. मगर CNN की एक रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक़, बहस ख़त्म होने के कुछ मिनटों बाद तक डेमोक्रैटिक पार्टी असमंजस में थी.\n\nये भी पढ़ें- Biden vs Trump: अर्थव्यवस्था, इमिग्रेशन और युद्ध पर तगड़ी बहस, पॉर्न स्टार की 'एंट्री' कैसे हो गई?\n\nCNN के जॉन किंग ने तो यहां तक रिपोर्ट किया है कि डेमोक्रेटिक पार्टी के अंदरख़ाने 'गहरी और बहुत तीव्र घबराहट' पसर गई है.\n\nपूर्व-राष्ट्रपति बराक ओबामा के विशेष सलाहकार वैन जोन्स ने बाइडन के प्रदर्शन को 'दर्दनाक' बताया है. वहीं, यूरेशिया ग्रुप के अध्यक्ष इयान ब्रेमर ने टिप्पणी की है कि एक तरफ़ ट्रंप 'जीवंत, नियमों के पक्के और विश्वास' में दिखे, वहीं बाइडन 'असंगत' थे. ब्रेमर ने कहा,\n\n\"ये बाइडन के कैम्पेन की अभियान की सबसे ख़राब शाम थी. अब उनके अलावा किसी और को चुनाव लड़ने के लिए खोजने का दबाव बहुत ज़्यादा होने वाला है.\"\n\nहालांकि, उप-राष्ट्रपति कमला हैरिस ने डेमोक्रेट्स को आश्वस्त करने का प्रयास किया है. उन्होंने कहा कि उन्होंने 'धीमी शुरुआत' की है, मगर अंत में वही जीतेंगे.\n\nये भी पढ़ें - अमेरिका के प्रेसिडेंशियल डिबेट्स के नियम, इतिहास और पूरी कहानी\n\nकुछ समय से सबसे ज़्यादा चर्चा दोनों कैंडिडेट्स की उम्र को लेकर है. जो बाइडन 81 बरस के हैं और ट्रंप 78 के. दोनों ही भाषणों के दौरान लाइन-लेंथ से भटकते दिखे हैं. ख़ासतौर पर बाइडन. इसलिए दोनों पार्टियों के समर्थक उम्मीद कर रहे थे कि डिबेट के दौरान उनके नेता गड़बड़ाएं नहीं. लेकिन कहीं न कहीं ये डर सही साबित हुआ. क्योंकि ट्रंप आक्रामक थे, अपने अंदाज़ में थे. लेकिन बाइडन अपनी कर्कश आवाज़ और धीमे लहजे के साथ जूझते रहे. बाइडन ने ट्रंप की क़ानूने मसले उछाले. उन्हें 'अपराधी' कहा, उनकी नैतिकता पर सवाल उठाए. मगर धीरे से.\n\nइमिग्रेशन और युद्ध जैसे प्रमुख मुद्दों पर भी बाइडन अपनी बात ठीक से रख नहीं पाए. बाइडन ने कई ग़लतियां की हैं. ये कोई आम दर्शक भी समझ सकता है. सोशल मीडिया की जनता ने उनकी ये ग़लतियां शेयर कीं. वो अपने दावों को सही आधार नहीं दे पा रहे थे. कहते-कहते कह गए कि अमेरिका में एक हज़ार खरबपति हैं.\n\nये भी कह गए कि वो पिछले दस सालों में एकमात्र राष्ट्रपति हैं, जिनके पद पर रहते हुए कोई सैनिक नहीं मरा. बाइडन को कई बार अपना गला साफ़ करते या खांसते हुए सुना गया. उन्हें अपनी दलीलें पूरी करने में भी परेशानी हो रही थी.\n\nहालांकि, ऐसा भी नहीं है कि ज़्यादा उम्र का मुद्दा पहली बार अमेरिकी चुनाव में चर्चा का विषय बना हो. 1984 में रॉनल्ड रीगन बनाम वॉल्टर मोंडेल के बीच भी ये मुद्दा गर्माया था. डिबेट का भी हिस्सा था. और जब रीगन से ये सवाल पूछा गया, तो उन्होंने अपने जवाब से सबका दिल जीत लिया. दरअसल, 1984 में रॉनल्ड रीगन की उम्र 73 थी. उनके ख़िलाफ़ वॉल्टर 56 साल के थे.\n\nहोस्ट ने रीगन से पूछा कि क्या वे राष्ट्रपति पद की ज़िम्मेदारी ठीक से निभा पाएंगे? रीगन का जवाब था,\n\n\"मैं इस डिबेट में जीत हासिल करने के लिए अपने प्रतिद्वंद्वी की कम उम्र और अनुभवहीनता का फ़ायदा नहीं उठा सकता.\"\n\nइस जवाब से जनता हंसने लगी. ख़ूब सराहा भी गया. रीगन उस साल का चुनाव जीते भी.\n\nबहस में जनता, डेमोक्रैट्स और टिप्पणीकारों ने बाइडन का वो रूप मिस किया, जो उन्होंने मार्च में उनके दूसरे स्टेट ऑफ़ द यूनियन भाषण में देखा था. विश्लेषकों ने उसे 'उग्र' और लीग से अलग बताया था.\n\nप्राइमरी हो जाने के बाद किसी भी पार्टी के पास अपने राष्ट्रपति पद के उम्मीदवार को बदलने की मोहलत कम रहती है. जहां पार्टी आधिकारिक तौर पर राष्ट्रपति और उपराष्ट्रपति पद के लिए उम्मीदवार का नामांकन करती है, उस डेमोक्रैटिक नैशनल कन्वेंशन को अब बस दो महीने रह गए हैं. हालांकि, दी प्रिंट की पिया कृष्णनकुट्टी ने अपनी रिपोर्ट में लिखा है कि अगर राष्ट्रपति या उपराष्ट्रपति पद का उम्मीदवार अपना नाम वापस ले लेता है या मर जाता है, तो डेमोक्रैटिक नैशनल कमेटी के पास एक नया उम्मीदवार चुनने का अधिकार है.\n\nएक और बात. अगर बाइडन अपना नाम वापस ले लेते हैं, तो ज़रूरी नहीं कि उपराष्ट्रपति कमला हैरिस को टिकट दे दिया जाए. समिति अलग-अलग पैमाने जांचने के बाद अंतिम निर्णय लेगी.\n\nदूसरी और अंतिम बहस सितंबर में होगी.",

The debate covered key issues such as the economy, immigration, public safety, the Gaza conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war, abortion laws, and the China-Taiwan dispute. Biden's performance was widely criticized, with commentators from both political sides expressing concerns. Some Democrats are now questioning Biden's viability as a candidate against Trump.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama's advisor Van Jones described Biden's performance as \"painful,\" while Eurasia Group's Ian Bremmer noted that Trump appeared \"lively and confident,\" whereas Biden seemed \"inconsistent.\" Vice President Kamala Harris attempted to reassure Democrats, asserting that they would ultimately prevail despite a slow start.\n\nThe debate also highlighted concerns about the candidates' ages, with Biden at 81 and Trump at 78. Biden struggled with his delivery, making several errors and appearing less assertive compared to Trump. The Democratic National Convention, where the party officially nominates its candidates, is just two months away, leaving limited time for any potential changes in candidacy. The next and final debate is scheduled for September."

Trump labeled Biden as a \"Manchurian candidate\" influenced by China and criticized his handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Biden countered by claiming no U.S. soldiers died under his administration, a statement fact-checked as inaccurate.\n\nBiden also attacked Trump's character by bringing up his alleged involvement in an adult scandal.

प्रक्रिया के तहत भारतीय समयानुसार शुक्रवार सुबह 6 बजे से 8 बजे तक पहली प्रेसिडेंशियल डिबेट हुई. इस दौरान राष्ट्रपति जो बाइडेन (डेमोक्रेटिक पार्टी) और पूर्व राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप (रिपब्लिकन पार्टी) ने लोकतंत्र, राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा, रूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध, इजरायल-गाजा युद्ध, टैक्स सिस्टम, चीन के साथ रिश्ते, इमिग्रेशन पॉलिसी समेत तमाम मुद्दों पर बहस की. इस दौरान दोनों नेताओं ने एक-दूसरे पर निजी हमले करते हुए गंभीर आरोप भी लगाए. डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने जो बाइडेन पर आरोप लगाया कि उन्हें चीन से पैसे मिलते हैं. जबकि बाइडेन ने ट्रंप को पोर्न स्टार मामले को लेकर घेरा.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nइस बीच प्रेसिडेंशियल डिबेट

पर हुई. महंगाई की बात आते ही जो बाइडेन ने ट्रंप की तरफ बात को घुमा दिया. उन्होंने कहा कि ट्रंप ने उन्हें एक बिगड़ी हुई अर्थव्यवस्था सौंपी थी. बाइडेन ने कहा, \"जब मैं राष्ट्रपति बना तब हालात क्या थे. मिस्टर ट्रंप मेरे लिए क्या छोड़ कर गए थे? नौकरियां नहीं थीं. बेरोजगारी 15% बढ़ गई थी. हालात बहुत खराब थे. इसलिए हमें चीजों को वापस ट्रैक पर लाना था. हमने 15 हजार नए जॉब्स क्रिएट किए. इसमें और करने की जरूरत है.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nमंहगाई के मुद्दे पर डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने कहा, \"4 साल तक जब मैं राष्ट्रपति था, तब देश किसी युद्ध में नहीं उलझा. मेरे समय में काफी नौकरियां पैदा की गईं. बाइडेन प्रशासन में सिर्फ अवैध प्रवासियों को नौकरियां मिलीं.\"\n\nटैक्स सिस्टम\n\nटैक्स सिस्टम के मुद्दे पर ट्रंप ने कहा, \"मेरे शासनकाल में अमेरिका की अर्थव्यवस्था मजबूत थी. हमने देखा है कि टैक्स कम करने से दुनिया में कई इकोनॉमी बेहतर हुई हैं. मैनें अमेरिका के इतिहास में अब तक टैक्स पर सबसे ज्यादा छूट दी है.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nइसपर बाइडेन ने कहा, \"ट्रंप ने टैक्स में कटौती कर देश के अमीरों को फायदा पहुंचाया है. हमारे देश में 1 हजार अरबपति हैं , जो सिर्फ 8.2% टैक्स भरते हैं.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nजो बाइडेन और डोनाल्ड ट्रंप के बीच पहली प्रेसिडेंशियल डिबेट, जानें कैसे तय होगी जीत-हार, टॉस का क्या है रोल\n\nइजरायल-गाजा युद्ध\n\nपूर्व राष्ट्रपति ट्रंप ने कहा कि इजरायल को अपना काम खत्म करना चाहिए. उन्होंने कहा, \"बाइडेन एक फिलिस्तीनी की तरह हो गए हैं. फिलिस्तीनी बाइडेन को पसंद नहीं करते हैं क्योंकि वे एक बुरे 'फिलिस्तीनी' हैं.\"\n\nबाइडेन ने कहा, \"हमास युद्ध खत्म नहीं करना चाहता.\" उन्होंने इजरायल के लिए अमेरिकी प्रतिबद्धता को दोहराया और कहा कि हमास को खत्म कर दिया जाना चाहिए.\n\nअफगानिस्तान से अमेरिकी सेना की वापसी\n\nडिबेट में अफगानिस्तान से अमेरिकी सेना के लौटने और कोरोना महामारी के दौरान सरकार के रवैये पर भी बात हुई. इस पर बाइडेन ने कहा, \"ट्रंप प्रशासन के दौरान अमेरिकी सेना अफगानिस्तान में लड़ ही रही थी.\" कोरोना महामारी को लेकर बाइडेन ने कहा, \"उस वक्त सब कुछ एक कुव्यवस्था में बदल गया था.\"\n\nअफगानिस्तान पर ट्रंप ने कहा, \"उनका प्लान ताकत के साथ अफगानिस्तान से बाहर निकलने का था. जब बाइडेन वहां से निकले तो वो देश के इतिहास के लिए सबसे शर्मनाक पल था.\" ट्रंप ने कोरोना महामारी पर भी जवाब दिया. उन्होंने कहा, \"हम कोरोना महामारी की चपेट में आ गए. जब ऐसा हुआ तो हमने जरूरत के हिसाब से पैसे खर्च किए, ताकि मंदी के दौर में न चले जाएं. सब कुछ बेहतरीन था.\"\n\nक्या 500 डॉलर के नोट पर छापा जा सकता है ट्रंप का चेहरा, जानें ये कितना संभव\n\nरूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध\n\nडिबेट के दौरान ट्रंप ने यूक्रेन के लिए अमेरिकी मदद का मुद्दा एक बार फिर उठाया. उन्होंने कहा कि यूरोपीय देशों ने अमेरिका की तुलना में कम खर्च किया है. ट्रंप ने कहा, \"बाइडेन अब तक के सबसे बुरे चीफ कमांडर हैं. अमेरिकी सैनिक बतौर राष्ट्रपति मुझे ज्यादा पसंद करते हैं. मुझे पुतिन की शर्तें मंजूर नहीं हैं, लेकिन ये जंग कभी शुरू ही नहीं होनी थी. यूक्रेन को अब तक 200 अरब डॉलर दिए जा चुके हैं.\"\n\nट्रंप ने कहा, \"जब भी यूक्रेन के राष्ट्रपति जेलेंस्की यहां आते हैं, कई बिलियन डॉलर लेकर जाते हैं. वे दुनिया के सबसे बड़े सेल्समैन हैं. मैं राष्ट्रपति चुना गया तो पद संभालने से पहले ही रूस-यूक्रेन जंग खत्म करवा दूंगा.\"\n\nइसके जवाब में जो बाइडेन ने कहा, \"रूस ने हजारों सैनिकों को खो दिया है और कीव पर कब्जा करने के अपने उद्देश्य में सफल नहीं हुआ है. इस शख्स (ट्रंप) ने पुतिन से कहा कि आप जो करना चाहें करें. पुतिन का कहना था कि वह पांच दिनों में कीव पर कब्जा कर लेंगे, क्योंकि यह पुराने सोवियत संघ का हिस्सा था. मगर वह ऐसा नहीं कर सके, उन्होंने हजारों सैनिकों को खो दिया है.\"\n\nरूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन को युद्ध अपराधी करार देते हुए बाइडेन ने चेतावनी दी कि अगर रूस यूक्रेन पर कब्जा कर लेता है, तो इससे यूरोप में और संघर्ष हो सकता है. उन्होंने कहा कि पुतिन युद्ध अपराधी हैं.\n\nइमिग्रेशन पॉलिसी\n\nइमिग्रेशन के मुद्दे पर ट्रंप ने कहा, \"जो बाइडेन की इमिग्रेशन पॉलिसी और ओपन बॉर्डर वाले अप्रोच (दृष्टिकोण) ने देशभर में क्राइम रेट में इजाफा किया है. इसलिए देश में रह रहे अधिकतर प्रवासियों को बाहर निकालना होगा, क्योंकि वे हमारे देश को नष्ट करने जा रहे हैं.\" ट्रंप ने दावा किया बाइडेन साउथ यूएस बॉर्डर को सुरक्षित करने में नाकाम रहे. इससे देश में कई अपराधियों को शरण मिल गई है. उन्होंने यहां तक कह दिया, \"मैं इसे बाइडेन माइग्रेंट क्राइम (प्रवासी अपराध) कहता हूं.\"\n\nअपने बचाव में जो बाइडेन ने कहा, \"वो देश के आव्रजन संकट (Immigration Crisis) के बारे में झूठ फैलाते हैं. अमेरिका अवैध अप्रवासियों का स्वागत नहीं करता. ये सच नहीं है.\"\n\n\"गाजा में युद्ध समाप्त करने का सबसे अच्छा तरीका\": बाइडेन ने ईद-उल-अजहा के संदेश में संघर्ष विराम समझौते पर दिया जोर\n\nक्लाइमेट चेंज\n\nबाइडेन ने कहा, \"डोनाल्ड ट्रंप

ट्रिलियन डॉलर चुकाते थे. जबकि रूस, चीन और भारत ने एक रुपया नहीं दिया.\"\n\nअबॉर्शन लॉ\n\nडिबेट के दौरान अबॉर्शन लॉ पर भी बहस हुई. ट्रंप ने कहा, \"अबॉर्शन पर बैन लगाने वाले जज ग्रेट हैं. मैं राष्ट्रपति बना तो अबॉर्शन के पिल्स पर रोक नहीं लगाऊंगा. अबॉर्शन पर बैन कायम रखने के कोर्ट के फैसले से मैं सहमत हूं.\"\n\nबाइडेन ने कहा, \"अबॉर्शन कानून रद्द करना भयानक था. किसी नेता को अबॉर्शन पर फैसला करने का हक नहीं है. दोबारा राष्ट्रपति चुना गया तो इसपर फिर से कानून बनाऊंगा.\"\n\nडिबेट के दौरान हुए निजी हमले\n\nप्रेसिडेंशियल डिबेट के दौरान डोनाल्ड ट्रंप और जो बाइडेन ने एक दूसरे पर निजी हमले भी किए. बाइडेन ने कहा, \"पत्नी प्रेग्नेंट थीं, आप पोर्न स्टार से संबंध बना रहे थे.\" ट्रंप ने जवाब दिया,\"मैंने किसी पोर्न स्टार से संबंध नहीं बनाए हैं. इस मामले में जिन जजों ने सुनवाई की वे गलत थे.\"\n\nडिबेट में राष्ट्रपति बाइडेन ने उस हश मनी मामले का भी जिक्र किया, जिसमें ट्रंप को न्यूयॉर्क की एक अदालत ने दोषी करार दिया है. ट्रंप पर आरोप है कि उन्होंने साल 2016 में एक स्कैंडल से बचने के लिए पूर्व पॉर्न स्टार स्टॉर्मी डेनियल्स को चुप रहने के बदले मोटी रकम दी थी. बाइडेन ने कहा कि ट्रंप एक नैतिक व्यक्ति नहीं हैं, हालांकि ट्रंप ने बाइडेन के इस आरोप को खारिज कर दिया.\n\nगाजा में

This downturn is attributed to ongoing global conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, and the economic recession in the US. These factors have led to increased container rates and raw material costs. Moradabad, which typically exports goods worth 8,000 to 9,000 crore INR annually, with 60-70% going to the US, is now facing severe challenges. Exporters and artisans are deeply concerned, hoping for an end to the conflicts to revive their business."

        "body": "Opinion: आप माननीय हैं। आप संविधान, विधान और व्यवस्था से ऊपर नहीं हैं। आपको न संसद की गरिमा का मान है न देश के गौरव का। शपथ ग्रहण में जिस तरह आपने अपने माननीय होने का परिचय दिया, वह हमारी संसदीय व्यवस्था का कभी हिस्सा नहीं हो सकता। आप अपनी हरकतों से खुद को भले गौरवान्वित महसूस कर रहे हों, लेकिन देश और लोकतंत्र शर्मसार है। आप के हाथों में संविधान की किताबें भले हों, लेकिन आपका व्यवहार संविधान की चौखट लांघता दिखा। 18वीं लोकसभा में 535 माननीय सांसदों ने शपथ ली, लेकिन किसी ने अपनी अमिट छाप नहीं छोड़ी। कुछ पुराने एवं वरिष्ठ माननीयों को छोड़कर। शपथ ग्रहण समारोह में जिस तरह की छवि हमारे माननीयों की उभर कर आई है वह अपने आप में शर्मसार करती है। देश की आत्मा कहीं से भी झलकती हुई नहीं दिखी। अनेकता में एकता की कोई गंध और सुगंध नई आई। सत्ता और विपक्ष पूरी तरह से विभाजित दिखा। माननीय सांसद देश, संविधान और संसद की व्यवस्था को ताक पर रखकर अपने-अपने राजनीतिक स्वार्थ, जातिवाद, धर्मवाद, क्षेत्रवाद और भाषावाद के अहम में टूटते और बिखरते दिखे।\n\nदेश की खूबसूरती हाशिये पर\n\nइस समारोह में देश की खूबसूरती हाशिये पर रही, जबकि क्षेत्रवाद, जाति और धर्म शीर्ष पर दिखा। यह अपने आप में विचारणीय बिंदू है। हम देश को किस तरफ ले जा रहे हैं। देश की जनता ने जिन लोगों को चुनकर भेजा है उसे आप क्या संदेश देना चाहते हैं यह अपने आप में विचरणीय प्रश्न है। इस पर विस्तृत विमर्श की जरूरत है। हम वोटबैंक और सत्ता के लालच में वैचारिक विभाजन के जरिये सामाजिक अलगाववाद की तरह बढ़ रहे हैं। अब इससे बड़ी हमारी सोच क्या हो सकती है कि हमने देश के खिलाफ साजिश रचने वालों को चुनकर संसद भेज दिया है, जबकि चुनाव जीतने वाले जेल में बंद होने की वजह से शपथ भी नहीं ले पाए। यह क्षेत्रवाद का ही जहर है। फिर राष्ट्रीय एकता की बात कहां से कर सकते हैं। ऑल इंडिया मजलिस-ए-इत्तेहादुल मुस्लिमीन (एआईएमआईएम) हैदराबाद का प्रतिनिधित्व कर रहे असदुद्दीन ओवैसी ने जिस तरह संसद की गरिमा और व्यवस्था को तार-तार किया वह अपने आप में काबिलेगौर है। भारतमाता और संविधान की जय बोलने के बजाय जय भीम, जय मीम, जय तेलंगाना और जय फिलिस्तीन का नारा बुलंद किया। ओवैसी को सिर्फ एक क्षेत्र विशेष से प्रतिनिधित्व की जिम्मेदारी मिली है, लेकिन वह खुद को सरकार मान बैठे हैं। देश की नीति तय करने का अधिकार उन्हें किसने दिया। फिलिस्तीन इजरायल, रूस-यूक्रेन के प्रति हमारी नीति क्या होगी यह सार्वभौमिक संसद और सरकार तय तय करेगी। निश्चित रूप ओवैसी की तरफ से दिया गया बयान बेहद घटिया और संसद की गरिमा के खिलाफ है। उनकी संसद सदस्यता खत्म करने के लिए राष्ट्रपति को जो पत्र दिए गए हैं उस पर गंभीरता से विचार होना चाहिए।\n\nराहुल गांधी की बचकानी हरकतें\n\nसद में प्रतिपक्ष के नेता निर्वाचित हुए राहुल गांधी हाथ में संविधान लेकर शपथ ग्रहण करने पहुंचे। उन्होंने अपनी शपथ अंग्रेजी में और शपथ ग्रहण के बाद जय संविधान का नारा लगाया। यह उनकी बचकानी हरकतें हैं। वह पुराने सदस्य हैं उन्हें राजनीतिक स्टंट से दूर रहना चाहिए। अपने गंभीर व्यक्तित्व का परिचय देना चाहिए, उस स्थिति में जब वे विपक्ष के नेता चुने जा रहे हैं। उत्तर प्रदेश नगीना सीट से पहली बार विजयी हुए चंद्रशेखर आजाद रावण ने एक साथ कई नारे बुलंद किए जिसमें नमो बुद्धाय, जय भीम, जय भारत, जय संविधान, जय मंडल, जय जवान, जय किसान, भारतीय लोकतंत्र जिंदाबाद, भारत की महान जनता जिंदाबाद के नारे लगाए। इससे भी सत्ता और विपक्ष के सांसदों के बीच नोकझोंक हुई। रावण बसपा यानी मायावती को कमजोर देख दलितों को खुद का मसीहा दिखाने के लिए तेवरदार राजनीति का नैरेटिव गढ़ रहे हैं। उनकी राजनीति वोटबैंक के लिए अच्छी हो सकती है, लेकिन समाज व्यवस्था के लिए बिल्कुल नहीं। शपथ ग्रहण के दौरान भाजपा सांसदों ने धार्मिक नारों का उपयोग किया। बरेली सीट से भाजपा सांसद छत्रपाल गंगवार ने जहां जय हिंदू राष्ट्र का नारा दिया। वहीं मेरठ से टीवी सीरियल रामायण में राम की भूमिका निभाने वाले अरुण गोविल जय श्रीराम का जयघोष किया। विपक्ष ने दोनों सांसदों के नारे का प्रबल विरोध किया। अरुण गोविल के जय श्री राम नारे के विरोध में समाजवादी पार्टी के सांसदों ने जय अवधेश नारा बुलंद किया, क्योंकि अयोध्या की फैजाबाद सीट से अवधेश कुमार निर्वाचित हुए हैं। इस सीट पर भाजपा की हार को लेकर गंभीर चर्चा हो रही है और अयोध्या के लोगों पर सोशल मीडिया पर टिप्पणियां की जा रही हैं, जबकि मथुरा से भाजपा सांसद हेमा मालिनी ने शपथ ग्रहण के बाद राधे-राधे कर लोगों का अभिवादन किया। क्योंकि वह मथुरा से चुनकर आती हैं और मथुरा भगवान कृष्ण से जड़ा है।\n\nनारे लगाने की होड़ चल रही हो\n\nशपथ ग्रहण समारोह में सांसदों के व्यवहार और नारेबाजी को लेकर ऐसा लग रहा था जैसे नव निर्वाचित माननीयों में नारे लगाने की होड़ चल रही हो। इस नारेबाजी की होड़ में कोई पिछड़ना नहीं चाह रहा था। डीएमके सांसदों ने उदय नीति स्टालिन जिंदाबाद के नारे लगाए, जबकि गाजियाबाद से निर्वाचित भाजपा सांसद अतुल गर्ग ने अटल बिहारी और नरेंद्र मोदी जिंदाबाद के नारे लगाए। इसके बाद उन्होंने डॉ. हेडगेवार जिंदाबाद के भी नारे लगाए। पूर्वांचल की भदोही लोकसभा सीट से निर्वाचित सांसद डॉ. विनोद बिंद ने जय बिंद, समाज, जय निषाद जैसे जातिवादी नारों का प्रयोग किया। देवरिया से संसद पहुंचे शशांक मणि ने अपने अंतिम उद्बोधन में जय देवरिया का नारा लगाया। देश के विभिन्न हिस्सों से चुनकर आए माननीय सांसदों का व्यवहार संसद के प्रति कितना उत्तरदायी था यह कहना बड़ा मुश्किल है। पुराने और कई वरिष्ठ सांसदों को छोड़ दिया जाए तो अधिकांश माननीयों ने शपथ ग्रहण के दौरान संसद और लोकतंत्र के प्रति कोई जिम्मेदारी नहीं दिखाई। देश के मीडिया में शपथ ग्रहण समारोह की खूब चर्चा है। अब वक्त आ गया है जब शपथ ग्रहण के लिए भी एक विशेष गाइडलाइन बननी चाहिए, जिसमें कोई भी निर्वाचित सांसद क्षेत्रवाद, धर्म-जाति, भाषा का नारा बुलंद नहीं कर सकता। शपथ ग्रहण समारोह चाहे जिस भाषा में हो लेकिन देश, संविधान और संसद की गरिमा का सम्मान आवश्यक है। अगर जिंदाबाद करना है तो सिर्फ भारत माता और संविधान की करिये। सत्ता हो या विपक्ष सभी को इस मर्यादा का ख्याल रखना चाहिए। सरकार को आगे आकर मानसून सत्र में इस पर गंभीर चर्चा करानी चाहिए। विपक्ष को इस पर सहयोग करना चाहिए, क्योंकि यह सवाल सिर्फ सत्ता-विपक्ष का नहीं बल्कि देश, संसद और लोकतंत्र की गरिमा का है। शपथ ग्रहण समारोह के लिए एक विशेष नियम और कानून की व्यवस्था होनी चाहिए। जिस तरह हमारे माननीयों ने जिंदाबाद की संस्कृति का ईजाद किया वह पूरी तरह संसद की संस्कृति, संस्कार, विधान, व्यवस्था, गरिमा और मर्यादा के खिलाफ है।\n\nप्रभुनाथ शुक्ल: (लेखक वरिष्ठ पत्रकार है, ये

        "summary": "The opinion piece by Prabhunath Shukla in Haribhoomi emphasizes the importance of maintaining the dignity of the Indian Parliament. It criticizes the behavior of newly elected MPs during the 18th Lok Sabha oath-taking ceremony, highlighting that their actions often crossed constitutional boundaries and lacked respect for parliamentary decorum. Key points include:\n\n1. **Disrespectful Behavior**: MPs displayed behavior that was seen as disrespectful to the Constitution and parliamentary traditions. This included shouting regional, caste-based, and religious slogans instead of focusing on national unity.\n   \n2. **Specific Incidents**: \n   - Asaduddin Owaisi from AIMIM raised slogans like \"Jai Bhim, Jai Meem, Jai Telangana, Jai Palestine\" instead of \"Bharat Mata ki Jai\" or \"Constitution Zindabad.\"\n   - Rahul Gandhi, elected as the leader of the opposition, took his oath in English and shouted \"Jai Constitution,\" which was seen as immature.\n   - BJP MPs used religious slogans, such as \"Jai Hindu Rashtra\" and \"Jai Shri Ram,\" which were opposed by other parties.\n   - Other MPs from various parties also raised slogans promoting regionalism and casteism.\n\n3. **Implications**: The article argues that such behavior undermines the unity and dignity of the Parliament and reflects poorly on the country's democratic values. It calls for the establishment of guidelines to ensure that oath-taking ceremonies respect the Constitution and national unity, avoiding divisive slogans.\n\n4. **Call to Action**: The author urges the government and opposition to discuss and implement rules during the monsoon session to preserve the sanctity of parliamentary proceedings.\n\nThe piece concludes by stressing that the behavior of MPs during the oath-taking ceremony should reflect their responsibility towards the nation, the Constitution, and the Parliament."

        "body": "US में नवंबर, 2024 में राष्ट्रपति चुनाव होने हैं, और अमेरिका के चुनाव चक्र में राष्ट्रपति पद के उम्मीदवार रवायतन डिबेट करते हैं. इस बार भी Democrat President Joe Biden और उनके रिपब्लिकन प्रतिद्वंद्वी पूर्व-राष्ट्रपति Donald Trump आमने-सामने आए. जॉर्जिया के अटलांटा में CNN वालों के स्टूडियो में हुई ये पहली बहस 90 मिनट चली. अर्थव्यवस्था, विदेश नीति से लेकर एक दूसरे पर लगने वाले सब आरोपों को अड्रेस किया.\n\nस्टूडियो में कोई लाइव ऑडियंस मौजूद नहीं थी. पारंपरिक तौर पर बहस से पहले दोनों प्रतिभागी हाथ मिलाते हैं. लेकिन बाइडन और ट्रंप ने हाथ नहीं मिलाया. सीधे जा कर अपने-अपने पोडियम पर खड़े हो गए. 2020 राष्ट्रपति चुनाव के वक़्त जब डिबेट हुई थी, तब भी उन्होंने हाथ नहीं मिलाया था. लेकिन वो कोरोना महामारी की वजह से एहतियायतन लिया गया फ़ैसला था.\n\nख़ैर, अब जान लेते हैं कि दोनों के बीच अलग-अलग मुद्दों पर बहस क्या हुई.\n\nअर्थव्यवस्था: राष्ट्रपति बाइडन ने समय नहीं बर्बाद किया. फ़ौरन इकोनॉमी पर आ गए. कहा कि ट्रम्प के कार्यकाल के दौरान अर्थव्यवस्था गर्त में चली गई. जब उन्होंने पदभार संभाला, तो अमेरिकी इकोनॉमी तेज़ी से नीचे गिर रही थी. फिर उन्होंने COVID-19 महामारी से निपटने के ट्रम्प के तरीक़ों की आलोचना की. फिर बेरोज़गारी की ओर ध्यान खींचा और कहा,\n\nहर्बर्ट हूवर के अलावा डॉनल्ड ट्रम्प एकमात्र ऐसे राष्ट्रपति हैं, जिनके सत्ता में आने से पहले ज़्यादा नौकरियां थीं और जाते-जाते कम होती चली गईं. चार साल की अवधि में किसी भी अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति पर इतना राष्ट्रीय ऋण नहीं लगा, जितना ट्रम्प पर था.\n\nट्रम्प ने टैरिफ़ दस फ़ीसदी बढ़ाने की बात कही. इस तर्ज़ पर कि इससे अन्य देश अमेरिका को 'लूट' नहीं पाएंगे. अर्थशास्त्रियों ने कई बार चेताया है कि अगर टैरिफ़ में नाटकीय बढ़ोतरी की जाती है, तो बाक़ी देशों के साथ अमेरिका के व्यापार संबंधों को नुक़सान पहुंच सकता है.\n\nये भी पढ़ें - ट्रंप और बाइडन के बीच पहली भिड़ंत: क्या है प्रेसिडेंशियल डिबेट्स की कहानी?\n\nविदेश नीति: बहस तब और गरमा गई, जब विदेश नीति का मुद्दा छिड़ा. ख़ासतौर पर अफ़ग़ानिस्तान से अमेरिकी सैनिकों की वापसी पर. ट्रम्प ने ये मौक़ा नहीं छोड़ा. उसे 'देश के इतिहास का सबसे शर्मनाक दिन' बता दिया. कहा,\n\nमैं अफ़ग़ानिस्तान से बाहर जा रहा था. लेकिन हम गरिमा और ताक़त के साथ निकल रहे थे.\n\nबाइडन ने जवाब दिया कि जब ट्रम्प राष्ट्रपति थे, तब भी अफ़ग़ानिस्तान में लोगों को मारा जा रहा था और उन्होंने इस बारे में कुछ नहीं किया. इस आरोप के जवाब में ट्रम्प ने सैनिकों को 'बेवकूफ़' क़रार दिया. बाइडन ने अपने दिवंगत बेटे ब्यू की याद दिलाई, जिन्होंने इराक़ में सर्व किया था और बाद में कैंसर से उनकी मृत्यु हो गई थी. बाइडन ने कहा,\n\nमेरा बेटा लूज़र नहीं था, बेवकूफ़ नहीं था. तुम बेवकूफ़ हो. तुम लूज़र हो.\n\nइमिग्रेशन: बहस का एक और गर्म मुद्दा, और बाइडन की दुखती रग. ट्रम्प ने दावा किया बाइडन दक्षिणी-अमेरिकी सीमा को सुरक्षित करने में विफल रहे हैं. इससे देश में कई अपराधियों को शरण मिल गई है. यहां तक कह दिया, \"मैं इसे बाइडन माइग्रेंट क्राइम (प्रवासी अपराध) कहता हूं.\"\n\nये भी पढ़ें - ऋषि सुनक का 'सीक्रेट प्लैन', जिसके चलते उन्होंने 6 महीने पहले संसद भंग करवा दी?\n\nवहीं, उन्होंने ट्रम्प पर आरोप लगाए कि वो देश के आव्रजन संकट (immigration cirsis) के बारे में झूठ फैलाते हैं. उन्होंने कहा कि अमेरिका अवैध अप्रवासियों का स्वागत नहीं करता. ये बिल्कुल सच नहीं है.\n\nट्रम्प जो भी कहते हैं, उसके समर्थन में उनके पास कोई डेटा नहीं है. एक बार फिर, वो अतिशयोक्ति कर रहे हैं. झूठ बोल रहे हैं.\n\nग़ाज़ा और यूक्रेन युद्ध: ट्रम्प ने तो सीधे कहा कि अगर वो राष्ट्रपति होते, तो रूस यूक्रेन पर आक्रमण करता ही नहीं. उन्होंने कहा कि अफ़ग़ानिस्तान से अमेरिका का जाना इतना अव्यवस्थित था कि इसकी वजह से यूक्रेन में पुतिन की योजना को बल मिला. ट्रम्प ने ये भी कहा कि उनके कार्यकाल में हमास इज़रायल पर हमला करना सोच भी नहीं सकता था, क्योंकि जब वो राष्ट्रपति थे तो 'ईरान दिवालिया हो चुका था'.\n\nबाइडन बहस में रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन को खींच लाए और बड़े कड़े रुख के साथ.\n\nसच तो यह है कि पुतिन एक युद्ध अपराधी हैं. उन्होंने हज़ारों-हज़ारों लोगों को मारा है. आपको लगता है कि वो आपके होने से रुक जाते? आपको लगता है कि वो यूक्रेन पर क़ब्ज़ा करने के बाद रुक जाएंगे?\n\nबाइडन ने कहा कि संयुक्त राष्ट्र से लेकर इज़रायल के प्रधानमंत्री बेंजामिन नेतन्याहू तक, सभी ने उनकी युद्ध विराम योजना पर सहमति जताई है. आगे कहा, \"केवल हमास युद्ध जारी रखना चाहता है.\"\n\nनेतन्याहू ने हमेशा यही कहा है कि इज़रायल ऐसे किसी समझौते पर सहमत नहीं होगा, जिससे उसके मक़सद पूरा होने से पहले युद्ध ख़त्म हो जाए. ट्रंप ने भी अपने जवाब में यही कहा कि असल में नेतन्याहू युद्ध जारी रखना चाहते हैं.\n\nगर्भपात: ये तो वहां की पब्लिक डिसकोर्स में भी विवादित विषय है. बाइडन ने गर्भपात प्रतिबंध (abortion ban) के पक्षधर होने के लिए ट्रम्प पर हमला किया. उन्होंने बलात्कार पीड़ित महिलाओं की दुर्दशा को संबोधित किया, जिन्हें गर्भपात सेवाओं तक पहुंचने में दिक़्क़त आ रही है, उनके हवाले से कहा,\n\nये हास्यास्पद है और वे इसके बारे में कुछ नहीं कर सकते. आपकी नैतिकता गली की बिल्ली है.\n\nयहां पर बाइडन ने एक तीर दो निशाने मारे. उन्होंने ट्रम्प का स्टॉर्मी डैनियल प्रकरण भी हाई-लाइट किया.\n\nट्रम्प ने तुरंत जवाब दिया, \"मैंने किसी पॉर्न स्टार के साथ सेक्स नहीं किया.\"\n\nगर्भपात वाले मसले में ट्रम्प ने ये तर्क दिया कि इस मुद्दे को राज्यों को ही देखना चाहिए. यही सही क़दम था और बाइडन पर आरोप लगाया कि वो गर्भपात पर किसी भी सीमा का समर्थन नहीं करते.\n\nCNN ने रिपोर्ट किया है कि जो बाइडन और डॉनल्ड ट्रम्प ने बहस में अपने आख़िरी टिप्पणी रखने के बाद हाथ मिलाए ही मंच से उतर गए. न शुरू में हाथ मिलाया. न आख़िर में. हो सकता है उन्होंने बशीर बद्र का ये शेर सुन रखा हो,",

        "summary": "In a 90-minute debate held at CNN's studio in Atlanta, Democrat President Joe Biden and Republican former President Donald Trump clashed on key issues such as the economy, foreign policy, immigration, and abortion. \n\n**Economy:** Biden criticized Trump's handling of the economy and COVID-19, highlighting increased unemployment and national debt during Trump's tenure. Trump proposed a 10% tariff increase to protect American interests, despite warnings from economists about potential trade relationship damage.\n\n**Foreign Policy:** The debate intensified over the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump called it a disgrace, while Biden defended his actions, recalling his late son Beau's military service. Trump claimed he would have prevented Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Hamas's attacks on Israel.\n\n**Immigration:** Trump accused Biden of failing to secure the southern border, leading to increased crime. Biden countered that Trump spreads misinformation about immigration.\n\n**Abortion:** Biden attacked Trump for supporting abortion bans, especially affecting rape victims, and referenced Trump's scandal with Stormy Daniels. Trump denied the affair and argued that abortion issues should be managed by states.\n\nThe debate ended without the traditional handshake, reflecting the ongoing tension between the two candidates."

        "title": "भारत के एंटी कन्वर्शन लॉ से अमेरिका का क्या लेना-देना, इतना चिंतित क्यों?",
        "body": "पीएम मोदी 8 जुलाई को रूस के दौरे पर जा सकते हैं. इससे पहले ही अमेरिका ने भारत को घेरना शुकरू कर दिया है, हाल ही में अमेरिका विदेश मंत्री ने हाल ही में भारत में हेट स्पीच, धर्म के नाम पर भेदभाव और एंटी कन्वर्जन लॉ पर चिंता जताई है.\n\nअमेरिका के विदेश मंत्री ने हाल ही में भारत को लेकर बड़ा बयान दिया है. उन्होंने कहा कि भारत में हेट स्पीच के मामले बढ़ते जा रहे हैं. उन्होंने ये भी कहा कि धर्म के नाम पर भेदभाव बढ़ रहा है. उन्होंने एंटी कन्वर्जन लॉ को लेकर भी बयान दिया. ब्लिंकन ने कहा कि हम इसको लेकर चिंतित हैं. अब यहां सवाल उठता है कि इस कानून को लेकर अमेरिका क्यों चिंतित है. दअरसल अमेरिका भारत और रूस के बीच गहरी होती दोस्ती से चिढ़ा हुआ है. अगर अमेरिका का कोई नेता आने वाले दिनों में भी भारत को लेकर ऐसा बयान देता है तो हैरानी नहीं होगी.\n\nरूस के यूक्रेन पर आक्रमण के बाद से ही अमेरिका ने उसपर प्रतिबंध लगाए हैं और दूसरे देशों से भी रूस के साथ कोई व्यापार न करने का आग्रह किया है. लेकिन भारत अपने हित पहले रखते हुए अमेरिका की धमकियों को दरकिनार कर रूस से अपने व्यापारिक और राजनीतिक संबंध मजबूत किए हैं. भारत ने पिछले दो सालों में रिकॉर्ड सस्ती दरों पर रूस से तेल आयात किया है और अब पीएम मोदी भी रूस के दौरे पर जा रहे हैं.\n\nरूस ने पहली बार अमेरिका के दुश्मन कहे जाने वाले ईरान का इस्तेमाल कर भारत को कोयला भेजा है. ईरान के बंदर अब्बास पोर्ट का इस्तेमाल करके नॉर्थ साउथ ट्रांजिट कॉरिडोर से कोयला भेजा गया है. जाहिर तौर पर ये देखकर अमेरिका खुश नहीं होगा. क्योंकि रूस के इस कदम से ईरान का महत्व बढ़ता है. भारत और रूस के बीच एनर्जी ट्रेड भी है. अमेरिका आधिकारिक तौर पर ये बोल चुका है कि भारत और रूस के बीच बढ़ती मिलिट्री इंगेजमेंट से वो चिंतित है. यही नहीं भारत और रूस न्यूक्लियर एनर्जी पर साथ काम कर रहे हैं, अमेरिका इसको लेकर भी चिंतित है.\n\nजानकारी के मुताबिक, पीएम मोदी 8 जुलाई को रूस के दौरे पर जा सकते हैं. कहा जा रहा है अमेरिका पीएम मोदी के रूस दौरे को लेकर भी चिढ़ा हुआ है. पीएम बनने के बाद मोदी का ये दूसरा दौरा होगा. प्रधानमंत्री मोदी के रूस दौरे की जानकारी क्रेमलिन की तरफ से दी गई है और भारतीय विदेश मंत्रालय का कहना है कि इसका ऐलान किया जाएगा.\n\nरूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध शुरू होने के बाद से प्रधानमंत्री मोदी का पहला रूसी दौरा होगा. वर्ष 2022 में प्रधानमंत्री मोदी का रूस दौरा टल गया था. इसके बाद मोदी-पुतिन लगातार संपर्क में बने रहे हैं लेकिन दोनों नेताओं में से किसी ने भी एक दूसरे देश का दौरा नहीं किया है. अब प्रधानमंत्री मोदी के जुलाई दौरे से रूस और भारत के रिश्ते के नए अध्याय का अनुमान जताया जा रहा है.",

This comes ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's planned visit to Russia on July 8. The U.S. is reportedly uneasy about the growing India-Russia relationship, especially in light of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Russia. Despite these sanctions, India has continued to strengthen its trade and political ties with Russia, including importing oil at record low prices and engaging in energy and military collaborations. The U.S. is also concerned about the use of Iran's port for coal shipments between India and Russia, which could increase Iran's strategic importance. Modi's upcoming visit to Russia is expected to further solidify the India-Russia relationship, marking a significant development since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war."

        "body": "वॉशिंगटन: अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति चुनाव में रिपब्लिकन और डेमोक्रेटिक पार्टी के उम्मीदवारों के बीच डिबेट हुई। इस डिबेट में अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति बाइडन कई बार फंसते हुए दिखे। वहीं ट्रंप का आक्रमक रूप देखने को मिला। ट्रंप लगातार बाइडन की नीतियों, माइग्रेशन क्राइसिस, रूस यूक्रेन युद्ध को न संभाल पाने का मुद्दा उठाते रहे। इस डिबेट के दौरान बाइडन फ्रीज होते रहे और घबराते दिखे। उन्होंने कई गलत बयान दिए, जिससे उनकी डेमोक्रेट पार्टी में नाराजगी और चिंता पैदा हो गई है। चुनाव में अब चार महीने से भी कम का समय बचा है। एक्सपर्ट्स का मानना है कि उन्हें उम्मीदवारी से हटाया जा सकता है।इस डिबेट के बाद CNN के मुख्य राष्ट्रीय संवाददाता जॉन किंग ने बताया कि आखिर बाइडेन की पार्टी के लोग क्या बात कर रहे हैं। उन्होंने कहा कि कुछ लोग बाइडेन से खुद पद छोड़ने के लिए कहना चाहते हैं। वहीं कुछ लोग सार्वजनिक रूप से इस बारे में बोलने की सोच रहे हैं। उन्होंने कहा, 'यह एक गेम चेंजिंग डिबेट थी। डेमोक्रेटिक पार्टी में एक गहरी, व्यापक और बहुत आक्रामक घबराहट देखी जा रही है। इसमें पार्टी के रणनीतिकार शामिल हैं। इसमें निर्वाचित सदस्य हैं, पार्टी के फंडरेजर भी शामिल हैं। वे राष्ट्रपति के प्रदर्शन को लेकर बातचीत कर रहे हैं, जो उन्हें लगता है कि निराशाजनक था। उन्हें लगता है कि इससे पार्टी के अन्य लोगों को नुकसान होगा और वे बातचीत कर रहे हैं कि आगे क्या करना चाहिए।'\n\nफ्रीज हो गए बाइडन\n\nइस डिबेट में एक ऐसा मौका आया, जो शायद इस सप्ताह, महीने या शायद वर्षों तक चर्चा का विषय बना रहेगा। बाइडन लगभग 9 सेकंड के लिए कुछ बोल नहीं पाए। ऐसा लग रहा था कि शायद उनकी सोचने की क्षमता चली गई है। इस दौरान ट्रंप उनकी तरह मुड़कर देखते रहे। अमेरिका समेत पूरी दुनिया ने इस डिबेट को देखा। लोग बाइडन की क्षमता पर सवाल उठा रहे हैं। वहीं ट्रंप ने डिबेट में कहा कि आज हम तीसरे विश्वयुद्ध के करीब पहुंच गए हैं, इसका कारण बाइडन हैं।\n\nदुनिया नहीं चाहती ट्रंप की वापसी, भारत के जी20 में दुनिया ने मुझसे कहा- बाइडेन\n\nबाइडन हटेंगे पीछे?जॉन किंग ने कहा, 'पार्टी के कुछ लोग बातचीत कर रहे हैं कि क्या उन्हें व्हाइट हाउस जाना चाहिए और राष्ट्रपति की उम्मीदवारी से हटने के लिए कहना चाहिए? बहस की शुरुआत ही खराब हुई। बाद में बाइडन भले ही ठीक से जवाब देते रहे। लेकिन अंत में उनका जवाब संतोषपूर्ण नहीं रहा।' उन्होंने आगे कहा, 'ट्रंप की पार्टी रिपब्लिकन के भी बहुत से लोग सोचते हैं कि यह डिबेट उनके लिए अच्छी नहीं रही। ट्रंप ने जितना हो सका फैक्ट से हटकर बातें कही। 6 जनवरी की हिंसा को लेकर उन्होंने सीधे सवालों का जवाब देने से इनकार किया।'",

Trump criticized Biden's policies, handling of the migration crisis, and the Russia-Ukraine war. Biden appeared nervous and made several errors, causing concern and dissatisfaction within the Democratic Party. With less than four months until the election, experts suggest Biden might be asked to withdraw his candidacy. CNN's John King reported that some Democrats are considering asking Biden to step down, while others are contemplating speaking out publicly. The debate highlighted deep anxiety among Democratic strategists, elected members, and fundraisers about Biden's performance, fearing it could harm the party. A particularly notable moment was when Biden froze for about nine seconds, raising questions about his capabilities. Trump claimed that Biden's actions have brought the world closer to a third world war. The debate has sparked discussions within the Democratic Party about potentially replacing Biden as their candidate."

        "body": "US Presidential Debate : नवंबर में अमेरिका में राष्ट्रपति के चुनाव होने वाले हैं. चुनाव से पहले शुक्रवार (28 जून) को अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति जो बाइडेन और डोनाल्ड ट्रंप के बीच डिबेट शुरू हो गई. दोनों नेता एक दूसरे पर हावी दिख रहे हैं. दोनों नेताओं ने अटलांटा में CNN के हेडक्वार्टर में बहस से पहले हाथ तक नहीं मिलाया. बस कुछ ही दूरी पर खड़े आपस में बहस करने लगे. राष्ट्रपति बाइडेन को ट्रंप इजराइल-हमास जंग को लेकर घेर रहे हैं. ट्रंप ने बहस के दौरान नाटो के बारे में भी संदेह व्यक्त किया. उन्होंने प्रवासियों के मुद्दे पर कहा कि हमें इनमें से बहुत से लोगों को बाहर निकालना होगा.\n\nट्रंप से जब पूछा गया कि क्या इनमें वे लोग भी शामिल हैं, जो काफी लंबे समय से अमेरिका में रह रहे हैं और इस वादे को वे कैसे पूरा करेंगे तो ट्रंप ने जवाब दिया कि जो बाइडेन की इमिग्रेशन पॉलिसी और ओपन बॉर्डर वाले दृष्टिकोण ने देश भर में अपराध दर में बढ़ोतरी में भूमिका निभाई है, इसलिए देश में रह रहे अधिकतर प्रवासियों को बाहर निकालना होगा, क्योंकि वे हमारे देश को नष्ट करने जा रहे हैं. बता दें कि इस डिबेट में सबसे बड़े मुद्दे अवैध प्रवासी, अबॉर्शन, इजराइल-हमास जंग, रूस-यूक्रेन जंग, रूस-चीन से संबंध, गन वायलेंस, टैक्स, महंगाई , बेरोजगारी, क्लाइमेट चेंज रखे गए हैं. दोनों नेता इन्हीं मुद्दों पर बहस कर अपने आपको सर्वश्रेष्ठ बताने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं.\n\nरूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध के लिए बाइडेन को बताया जिम्मेदार\n\nअपराध में बढ़ोतरी के आरोपों पर बाइडेन ने प्रतिक्रिया देते हुए इसे झूठा बताया. राष्ट्रपति जो बाइडेन ने ट्रंप के राष्ट्रपति पद की एक विवादास्पद घटना का भी उल्लेख किया और कहा कि पूर्व राष्ट्रपति ने कथित तौर पर शहीद हुए अमेरिकी सैनिकों को हारे हुए और बेवकूफ कहा था. ट्रंप ने दावा किया कि बाइडेन का ये आरोप मनगढ़ंत है. उन्होंने कहा कि मेरे अलावा किसी ने भी हमारे सैनिकों की बेहतर देखभाल नहीं की है. ट्रंप ने बाइडेन पर यूक्रेन रूस के मुद्दे पर कटघरे में खड़ा किया और आरोप कहा कि यूक्रेन में रूस की सेना की घुसपैठ के लिए जिम्मेदार बाइडेन ही हैं. जो बाइडेन ने कहा कि मैंने अपने जीवन में इतनी बकवास कभी नहीं सुनी.\n\n'ट्रंप ने पुतिन को यूक्रेन पर खुली छूट दी'\n\nराष्ट्रपति जो बाइडेन ने मीडिल ईस्ट और अफगानिस्तान की नीतियों का बचाव किया और दावा किया कि ट्रंप ने पुतिन को यूक्रेन पर खुली छूट दी. ट्रंप ने तुरंत जवाब दिया और कहा कि मैंने ऐसा कभी नहीं कहा.\n\nपोर्न स्टार के मुद्दे पर घिरे ट्रंप\n\nजो बाइडेन ने ट्रंप की आपराधिक सजा का भी मुद्दा उठाया. बाइडेन ने ट्रंप के कैरेक्टर पर भी सवाल उठाया. उन्होंने एडल्ट फिल्म स्टार स्टॉर्मी डेनियल्स का भी जिक्र किया. जिस पर ट्रंप घिरते नजर आए.\n\nडिबेट में लड़खड़ाई बाइडेन की जुबान\n\nबाइडेन के स्वास्थ्य को लेकर हमेशा सवाल उठते हैं, जिसका मुद्दा ट्रंप भी उठाते रहते हैं. आज डिबेट में भी उनकी आवाज लड़खड़ाती नजर आई. उन्होंने अरबपतियों को खरबपति बता दिया. तर्क देते हुए कहा कि अमीरों को अधिक टैक्स देना चाहिए, वे अपना सेंटेंस पूरा करने में असमर्थ दिखे.\n\nइजरायल-फिलिस्तीन युद्ध पर हुई तीखी बहस\n\nबाइडेन से पूछा गया कि वे हमास और इजरायल जंग को खत्म करने के लिए किस रणनीति का यूज करेंगे तो बाइडेन ने कहा कि वे युद्ध समाप्त करने के लिए बिलकुल तैयार नहीं हैं. राष्ट्रपति ने इजरायल के प्रति अपने अटूट समर्थन को दोहराया और हमास को जंग खत्म करने को कहा. एक सवाल के जवाब में ट्रंप ने कहा कि इजरायल को काम खत्म करना चाहिए. ट्रंप ने यूक्रेन के लिए अमेरिकी समर्थन के बारे में अपनी चिंताओं को दोहराया और कहा कि यूरोपीय देशों ने संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका की तुलना में कम आर्थिक मदद की है. वहीं, डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने अफगानिस्तान से सैनिकों की वापसी को अमेरिका के इतिहास का सबसे शर्मनाक दिन बताया. जिस पर बाइडेन चुप नजर आए.\n\nएक दूसरे की योग्यता पर भी उठे सवाल\n\nबाइडेन से पूछा गया कि दूसरे कार्यकाल में आपकी उम्र 86 साल होगी तो बाइडेन ने कहा कि ट्रंप मुझसे सिर्फ 3 साल छोटे हैं और मुझसे कम योग्य हैं. आप रिकॉर्ड देखिए कि उन्होंने मेरे लिए क्या छोड़ा था और मैंने कितना बदलाव किया है. जब ट्रंप से उम्र को लेकर सवाल किया गया तो 78 साल के पूर्व राष्ट्रपति ने कहा कि मेरा हेल्थ काफी अच्छा है. मैं गोल्फ खेलता हूं, लेकिन बाइडेन ऐसा नहीं कर सकते. वे 50 गज की दूरी तक भी बॉल को नहीं भेज सकते. ट्रंप ने दावा किया कि मैं 25 से 30 साल पहले की तरह ही फिट महसूस करता हूं. बाइडेन ने मजाकिया लहजे में कहा कि अगर ट्रंप बैग खुद लेकर चलें तो मुझे गोल्फ खेलने में खुशी होगी.",

        "body": "नई दिल्ली: रूस-यूक्रेन जंग को दो साल से अधिक हो गए. अब भी कत्लेआम जारी है. पूरी दुनिया किसी तरह जंग खत्म कराने की कोशिश में है. भारत भी चाहता है जंग खत्म हो. बातचीत से दोनों देशों के बीच अमन-चैन कायम हो. मगर दूसरी ओर चीन है, जो आग में घी डाल रहा है. चीन लगातार रूस को सैन्य और तकनीकी मदद कर रहा है. बात-बात पर गीदड़भभकी देने वाला चीन नहीं चाहता कि जंग खत्म हो. खुद अमेरिका ने चीन की पोल खोल दी है. अमेरिका ने डंके की चोट पर कहा है कि रूस-यूक्रेन जंग में चीन पुतिन की मदद कर रहा है. बीजिंग में अमेरिकी राजदूत निकोलस बर्न्स ने कहा कि यूक्रेन पर हमले में चीन द्वारा रूस को मिसाइल और अन्य हथियारों के रूप में तकनीकी मदद देना 'एक बड़ी गलती' है.\n\nअमेरिका ने चीन के घर में ही उसकी पोल खोली है. चीन के वित्तीय केंद्र शंघाई में दिए गए भाषण में अमेरिकी राजदूत निकोलस बर्न्स ने यह भी कहा कि रूस का हमला तीसरे साल में प्रवेश कर गया है. यह यूरोप में 'अस्तित्व का संकट' बन गया है. बर्न्स ने कहा, 'हमारा मानना है कि इस भयानक युद्ध के लिए रूसी संघ के रक्षा औद्योगिक आधार को सुदृढ़ और मजबूत करने के लिए हजारों की संख्या में चीनी कंपनियों को रूस को इतने सारे घटक, प्रौद्योगिकी घटक, माइक्रोप्रोसेसर (और) नाइट्रोसेल्यूलोज भेजने की अनुमति देना एक बड़ी गलती है.'\n\nअमेरिकी राजदूत ने कहा कि चीन 'निष्पक्ष नहीं है, बल्कि इस युद्ध में उसने प्रभावी रूप से रूस का पक्ष लिया है'. उन्होंने कहा कि यह निर्णय चीन के लंबे समय से 'संप्रभुता और क्षेत्रीय अखंडता' पर बल देने के सिद्धांत का खंडन करता है. बता दें कि चीन रूस को प्रत्यक्ष सैन्य सहायता प्रदान नहीं करने की बात पर जोर देता है, लेकिन पूरे संघर्ष के दौरान उसने मजबूत व्यापारिक संबंध बनाए रखे हैं. साथ ही रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादीमिर पुतिन और चीनी राष्ट्रपति शी जिनपिंग के बीच मुलाकात भी होती रहती हैं.\n\nहालांकि, अमेरिका की इस टिप्पणी पर चीन का अब तक कोई जवाब नहीं आया है. चीन-अमेरिका संबंधों पर एक कार्यक्रम के दौरान यह टिप्पणी की गई. अमेरिकी राजदूत ने यह अहम टिप्पणी ऐसे वक्त में की है, जब चीन और अमेरिका के संबंधों में काफी तकरार देखने को मिल रही है. ताइवान से लेकर तिब्बत जैसे मुद्दों पर अमेरिका और चीन आमने-सामने हैं. दोनों के बीच तल्खी काफी बढ़ गई है. अमेरिका और चीन दोनों एक-दूसरे पर हमला करने का एक भी मौका नहीं छोड़ते. अब जब अमेरिका यह बात जान गया है कि रूस-यूक्रेन जंग में चीन ने रूस की मदद की है तो सवाल है कि क्या अमेरिका कोई बड़ा एक्शन लेगा. क्या अमेरिका समेत नाटो देश चीन पर औरक शिकंजा कसेंगे?",

        "summary": "In a recent development, the U.S. has accused China of making a significant mistake by providing military and technical assistance to Russia in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. U.S. Ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, revealed in a speech in Shanghai that China has been supplying Russia with missiles, weapons, and other technological components, which he described as a grave error. Burns emphasized that this support contradicts China's long-standing principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Despite China's claims of not providing direct military aid to Russia, it has maintained strong trade relations and frequent meetings between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The U.S. revelation comes amid already strained U.S.-China relations over issues like Taiwan and Tibet. The key question now is whether the U.S. and NATO will take significant action against China for its involvement in the conflict."

X (पहले ट्विटर), फेसबुक, इंस्टाग्राम जैसे सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म पर यूजर्स के रिएक्शन से पता चलता है कि प्रेसिडेंट के इलेक्शन में कौन मजबूत है और कौन कमजोर.\n\n4. इसके अलावा वोटिंग इंटेंशन सर्वे भी हार-जीत का फैसला करने का एक जरिया है. कुछ एजेसिंया वोटिंग इंटेंशन सर्वे कराती हैं. इसमें वोटर्स से पूछा जाता है कि प्रेसिडेंशियल डिबेट के बाद क्या उनकी वोटिंग का फैसला बदला है? यानी जो कैंडिडेट ज्यादा वोटर्स को इंप्रेस कर पाता है, उसे विजेता माना जाता है.\n\nदूसरी डिबेट की डेट क्या है?\n\nजो बाइडेन और डोनाल्ड ट्रंप दूसरी डिबेट के लिए भी राजी हो गए हैं. 10 सितंबर को ये डिबेट होनी है, जिसे ABC मीडिया नेटवर्क होस्ट करेगा.\n\nवाइस प्रेसिडेंट की डिबेट कब होगी?\n\nअमेरिका में वाइस प्रेसिडेंशियल डिबेट 23 जुलाई या 13 अगस्त को हो सकती है. बाइडेन कैंपेन ने डिबेट की रिक्वेस्ट स्वीकार करते हुए कहा कि दोनों तारीखों पर कमला हैरिस डिबेट के लिए समय निकाल सकती हैं. हालांकि, ट्रंप ने अभी तक वाइस प्रेसिडेंट पद के डिबेट के लिए कैंडिडेट का ऐलान नहीं किया है.\n\nFeatured Video Of The Day\n\nDonald Trump और Joe Biden के बीच 90 Minute की बहस, कौन मारेगा बाज़ी?

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that this consideration is a response to the deep involvement of the U.S. and its allies in the conflict. He mentioned that it is standard practice to lower diplomatic relations with unfriendly nations and that Russia is exploring various options, though no decision has been made yet.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war began on February 24, 2022, following an announcement by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The conflict has divided the world, with NATO countries supporting Ukraine and nations like China, South Korea, and Iran indirectly backing Russia. India has remained neutral, advocating for an end to the war.\n\nAdditionally, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Russia on July 8-9 for a bilateral summit with President Putin, which is part of India's strategic considerations amid the escalating conflict. Preparations for the visit are underway, though official confirmation is pending."

        "body": "Russia-Ukraine War : रूस-यूक्रेन के बीच करीब 2 साल से जारी युद्ध अभी किसी निर्णायक स्थिति पर नहीं पहुंचा है. इस युद्ध में दोनों देशों के कई स्थानीय नागरिक और सेना के जवान अपनी जान गंवा चुके हैं. रूस फिलहाल युद्ध खत्म करने के मूड में नहीं है, क्योंकि उसने अब अपने नागरिकों को सेना में भर्ती करने की कवायद शुरू कर दी है. रूस एक परमाणु शक्ति देश है, जबकि यूक्रेन कमजोर देश होने के बावजूद पिछले दो वर्षों से रूस की सेना का सामना कर रहा है. रूस के एक सीनियर ऑफिसर ने गुरुवार को कहा कि रूस ने लगभग 10,000 आम नागरिकों को यूक्रेन में लड़ने के लिए भेजा है, हालांकि कुछ लोग ऐसे भी हैं जिन्होंने सेना में भर्ती होने की बजाए देश छोड़ने का ऑप्शन चुना है. आपको बता दें कि रूप पर ऐसे भी आरोप लगे हैं कि यूक्रेन से लड़ने के लिए उसने बड़ी संख्या में भर्ती अभियान चलाया है, जिसमें मध्य एशियाई प्रवासियों पर अपने रूसी सेना में शामिल होने के लिए दबाव डाला जा रहा है.\n\nरूस की जांच समिति के प्रमुख अलेक्जेंडर बैस्ट्रीकिन ने कहा कि रूस उन प्रवासियों पर कार्रवाई कर रहा है, जिन्होंने रूसी नागरिकता प्राप्त कर ली है, लेकिन सैन्य अधिकारियों के साथ रजिस्ट्रेशन नहीं करा रहे हैं. उन्होंने उन लोगों के डेटाबेस का जिक्र करते हुए कहा, 'हमने 30,000 से अधिक लोगों को पकड़ा है, जिन्होंने नागरिकता प्राप्त की थी, लेकिन सैन्य सेवा के लिए पंजीकरण नहीं कराना चाहते थे और उन्हें सूची में डाल दिया.' यूक्रेन अभियान के लिए रूस की आधिकारिक भाषा का उपयोग करते हुए उन्होंने कहा, 'पहले से ही लगभग 10000 आम नागरिकों को स्पेशल आर्मी मिशन के क्षेत्र में भेजा जा चुका है.'\n\nलाखों प्रवासी वर्कर्स में से ज्यादातर मध्य एशिया को लोग रूस में रहते हैं, जिनमें से कई कम वेतन वाली नौकरियां करते हैं और अपने घर वापस परिवारों को अपना वेतन भेजने के लिए खराब परिस्थितियों में रहते हैं. मजदूरों की कमी का सामना कर रहे रूस ने हाल के वर्षों में उनके लिए रूसी नागरिकता प्राप्त करना आसान बना दिया है. रूसी नागरिकता कई लोगों के लिए एक आकर्षक प्रस्ताव है क्योंकि यह देश में रहने और काम करने से जुड़ी नौकरशाही को काफी हद तक कम कर देती है. लेकिन यह प्रवासियों को सैन्य अधिकारियों के साथ रजिस्ट्रेशन कराने और बुलाए जाने पर सेना में सेवा करने के लिए भी बाध्य करता है. बैस्ट्रीकिन ने कहा कि निरीक्षण की तीव्रता के बीच कुछ लोगों ने 'धीरे-धीरे देश छोड़ना' शुरू कर दिया है. मार्च में मॉस्को शहर के कॉन्सर्ट हॉल पर हुए आतंकी हमले में 140 से अधिक लोगों की मौत के बाद रूस में भी प्रवासी विरोधी रवैया जोरों पर है.",

Additionally, Russia faces accusations of pressuring Central Asian migrants to join its military.\n\nAlexander Bastrykin, head of Russia's Investigative Committee, stated that Russia is taking action against migrants who obtained Russian citizenship but failed to register with military officials. He mentioned that over 30,000 such individuals have been identified and added to a list. Bastrykin confirmed that nearly 10,000 civilians have already been deployed to the conflict zone.\n\nMany Central Asian migrants in Russia, often working low-wage jobs, have been granted easier access to Russian citizenship, which simplifies bureaucratic processes but also obligates them to military service. Amid increased inspections, some migrants have started leaving the country. Anti-migrant sentiment in Russia has intensified, especially after a terrorist attack in Moscow in March that killed over 140 people."

This has led to an eightfold increase in synthetic diamond production. The industry is urging the Finance Minister to remove the 10% commercial tax, provide subsidies for machinery purchases and electricity bills, and promote lab-grown diamonds. Key figures like diamond unit owner Jitubhai Mordia and Sardar Patel Diamond Association President Narsingh Patel emphasize the need for these measures to sustain and grow the industry.

Subramanyan attributed the shortage to the high demand for certain skills, project execution pressures, and factors like elections and weather instability. The company is addressing these issues by providing transportation, nutritious food, and beverages to employees, and has established skill centers to mitigate the problem."

        "body": "MBBS की पढ़ाई के लिए सही देश का चयन करना महत्वपूर्ण है, जिसमें शिक्षा की गुणवत्ता और सामर्थ्य जैसे कारणों पर ध्यान दिया जाना चाहिए। जर्मनी, रूस, यूक्रेन, चीन, फिलीपींस और किर्गिज़स्तान जैसे देश अपनी उचित ट्यूशन फीस और किफायती जीवन-यापन लागत के कारण लोकप्रिय हैं। इन देशों में एमबीबीएस की फीस 2.47 लाख रुपये से लेकर 8.23 लाख रुपये प्रति वर्ष तक है। भारतीय छात्रों के लिए, कम लागत पर विदेश में एमबीबीएस की पढ़ाई करना एक व्यवहार्य विकल्प है, जो खर्चों को कम रखते हुए वैश्विक चिकित्सा शिक्षा का पता लगाने का मौका देता है।\n\nAlso Read: Scam से है बचना, तो SMS की ABCD को एक बार ज़रूर समझना :\n\nउन देशों की सूची जहां आप कम लागत पर मेडिकल डिग्री प्राप्त कर सकते हैं:\n\nजर्मनी- जर्मनी अपनी सस्ती शिक्षा के कारण अंतरराष्ट्रीय छात्रों के लिए एक व्यवहार्य विकल्प हो सकता है। यूरोपीय देशों में, जर्मनी कम रहने की लागत और ट्यूशन फीस के साथ एमबीबीएस के लिए खड़ा है, जो विविध अध्ययन विकल्प और उत्कृष्ट शिक्षा गुणवत्ता प्रदान करता है। यह विदेशी मेडिकल छात्रों के लिए सबसे सस्ते देशों में से एक है। जर्मनी में भारतीय छात्रों के लिए एमबीबीएस की ट्यूशन फीस प्रोग्राम और कॉलेज के आधार पर 5 लाख प्रति वर्ष से लेकर 10 लाख प्रति वर्ष तक होती है।\n\nरूस-\n\nरूस- कई मेडिकल छात्रों को यह जानकर आश्चर्य होगा कि रूस चिकित्सा अध्ययन के लिए सबसे किफायती विकल्पों में से एक प्रदान करता है। कई यूरोपीय देशों की तुलना में, रूस उचित लागत पर उच्च गुणवत्ता वाली शिक्षा प्रदान करता है, जिससे यह एमबीबीएस अध्ययन के लिए सबसे सस्ता स्थान बन जाता है। रूसी सरकार अंतरराष्ट्रीय छात्रों को छात्रवृत्ति भी प्रदान करती है।\n\nयूरोप-\n\nयूरोप में एमबीबीएस की डिग्री के लिए पढ़ाई करना महंगा हो सकता है, लेकिन रूस गुणवत्ता से समझौता किए बिना एक किफायती विकल्प प्रदान करता है। रूसी मेडिकल कॉलेजों में प्रवेश भी सुलभ है, जहाँ 12वीं कक्षा में लगभग 50% अंक की आवश्यकता होती है। औसत वार्षिक ट्यूशन फीस 2 लाख से 5 लाख रुपये या 200,000 से 500,000 रूसी रूबल प्रति वर्ष के बीच है।\n\nAlso Watch: बच्चों को भेजना चाहते हैं विदेश, करनी होगी इतनी सेविंग\n\nफिलीपींस-\n\nफिलीपींस- यह दक्षिण-पूर्व एशियाई देश मेडिकल डिग्री के लिए अधिक किफायती मार्ग प्रदान करता है। कई विश्वविद्यालय पूरी तरह से अंग्रेजी में पढ़ाए जाने वाले एमबीबीएस कार्यक्रम प्रदान करते हैं, और फिलीपींस मेडिकल लाइसेंसिंग परीक्षा (पीएमएलई) स्नातकों को सफलतापूर्वक पूरा होने के बाद भारत में चिकित्सा का अभ्यास करने की अनुमति देता है। हालांकि, शिक्षा की गुणवत्ता संस्थानों में भिन्न हो सकती है, इसलिए गहन शोध महत्वपूर्ण है। फिलीपींस में एमबीबीएस डिग्री के लिए पांच साल के लिए 15-22 लाख रुपये का शुल्क है।\n\nयूक्रेन-\n\nयूक्रेन- यूक्रेन भी छात्रों के लिए एक लोकप्रिय गंतव्य बन गया है, जहाँ 75,000 से अधिक अंतर्राष्ट्रीय छात्र हैं। यह MBBS की पढ़ाई के लिए सबसे किफ़ायती जगहों में से एक है। कई छात्र यूक्रेन को इसके शीर्ष सरकारी चिकित्सा विश्वविद्यालयों, किफ़ायती ट्यूशन और आसान प्रवेश प्रक्रिया के लिए चुनते हैं। किफ़ायती, गुणवत्तापूर्ण शिक्षा चाहने वाले भारतीय छात्रों के लिए यूक्रेन एक बेहतरीन विकल्प है। यूक्रेनी कॉलेजों को NMC, WHO, UNESCO, FAIMER और AMEE जैसे वैश्विक संस्थानों द्वारा मान्यता प्राप्त है। यूक्रेन में MBBS करने की लागत पूरे छह साल के कार्यक्रम के लिए 15 से 20 लाख तक हो सकती है।\n\nचीन-\n\nचीन- चीन में चिकित्सा की पढ़ाई सस्ती है और अंतरराष्ट्रीय स्तर पर सम्मानित डिग्री प्रदान करती है। एनएमसी ने चीन में 45 चिकित्सा संस्थानों को मंजूरी दी है, जिससे गुणवत्तापूर्ण शिक्षा और अंतरराष्ट्रीय मान्यता सुनिश्चित होती है। चीन से एमबीबीएस की डिग्री भारतीय छात्रों के लिए एक स्मार्ट विकल्प है, जो व्यावहारिक अनुभव और ठोस शिक्षा प्रदान करता है। चीन में चिकित्सा की पढ़ाई की लागत ट्यूशन के लिए प्रति वर्ष $3,000-$5,500 तक हो सकती है। पूरे एमबीबीएस कार्यक्रम की कुल लागत 15-24 लाख रुपये तक हो सकती है।",

        "body": "नई दिल्ली: भारत किसी से दोस्ती करता है तो फिर उसे अंत तक निभाता है. भारत की दोस्ती जितनी खूबसूरत है, दुश्मनी उतनी ही खतरनाक. यूक्रेन जंग की वजह से रूस संकटों से घिरा है. उसके ऊपर अमेरिका समेत पश्चिमी देशों का पहरा है. यूक्रेन जंग में रूस को अलग-थलग करने में पश्चिमी ताकतें लग चुकी हैं. मगर रूस का सदाबहार दोस्त उसकी मुश्किल घड़ी में भी उसके साथ खड़ा है. नाम है भारत. जी हां, जब यूक्रेन जंग में रूस पर पश्चिमी देशों ने प्रतिबंधों की बौछार की, तब भी भारत ने दोस्ती निभाई. जब अंतरराष्ट्रीय मंचों पर रूस पर नकेल कसने की तैयारी हो रही थी, तब भी भारत ने रूस का साथ दिया. अब जब यूक्रेन-रूस के बीच जंग के बाद अधिकतर देश पुतिन से कन्नी काट रहे हैं, ऐसे में एक बार फिर भारत ने दिखाया है कि दोस्त हम तुम्हारे साथ हैं. जी हां, तीसरी बार प्रधानमंत्री बनने वाले नरेंद्र मोदी अपने दोस्त पुतिन से मिलने मॉस्को जा रहे हैं. मिलना तो पीएम मोदी को उज्बेकिस्तान में चीन के राष्ट्रपति शी जिनपिंग से भी था. मगर उन्होंने जिनपिंग को ना कह दिया. अब वह 2800 किलोमीटर दूर जाकर पुतिन से अकेले में मिलेंगे. पीएम मोदी ने अब ऐसा फैसला क्यों लिया है, यह जानना बेहद दिलचस्प है.\n\nदरअसल, पीएम मोदी अगले महीने रूस की यात्रा पर जाने वाले हैं. पीएम मोदी इंडिया-रशिया एनुअल समिट के लिए मास्को जाने वाले हैं. हालांकि, अभी तक तारीखों का ऐलान नहीं हुआ है. मीडिया रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी जुलाई के दूसरे सप्ताह में रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन से मुलाकात करेंगे और एनुअल भारत-रूस समिट वार्ता भी करेंगे. यहां ध्यान देने वाली बात है कि पीएम मोदी रूस-यूक्रेन जंग के बाद पहली बार पुतिन से मिलने मॉस्को जा रहे हैं. पीएम मोदी की यह यात्रा ऐसे वक्त में हो रही है, जब पिछले ढाई साल से रूस और यूक्रेन जंग की आग में जल रहे हैं. रूस-यूक्रेन जंग पर भारत ने शुरू से ही शांति का पक्ष लिया है. भारत ने कहा है कि वार्ता के जरिए ही शांति बहाल हो सकती है और युद्ध खत्म हो सकता है. यही वजह है कि हाल ही में भारत ने स्विटजरलैंड में यूक्रेन पीस समिट में भाग लिया. हालांकि, भारत ने इस समिट में रूस की गैरमौजूदगी पर सवाल उठाया और यूक्रेन शांति से जुड़े दस्तावेज पर सिग्नेचर करने से इनकार कर दिया. भारत भले ही रूस-यूक्रेन जंग में शांति की वकालत करता रहा है. मगर भारत ने कभी अपने दोस्त रूस को भला-बुरा नहीं कहा. हालांकि, मोदी ने दोस्त पुतिन को शांति का पाठ जरूर पढ़ाया और शांति से मामले को निपटाने को कहा.\n\nपुतिन से मिलने मॉस्को जाएंगे मोदी\n\nमोदी के लिए पुतिन और रूस की दोस्ती काफी अहमयित रखती है. पीएम मोदी चाहते तो अगले ही महीने कजाकस्तान में होने वाले एससीओ समिट में पुतिन से मिल लेते. मगर पीएम के मन में कुछ और बड़ा प्लान है. वह रूस जाकर पुतिन से मिलेंगे, ताकि दुनिया को एक संदेश जाए कि भारत किसी के दबाव में आकर अपनी दोस्ती-दुश्मनी नहीं करता है. रूस जाकर पुतिन से मिलने के पीछे मोदी का एक और मकसद है. बीते कुछ दिनों में पुतिन और जिनपिंग की नजदीकियां बढ़ी हैं. ऐसे में पीएम मोदी जिनपिंग को यह बताना चाहते हैं कि भारत और रूस की दोस्ती अटूट है. इस दोस्ती के बीच में चीन की कोई जगह नहीं है. यूक्रेन जंग के बाद से चीन लगातार रूस पर डोरे डाल रहा है. यही वजह है कि पांचवीं बार राष्ट्रपति बनने के बाद पुतिन चीन के दौरे पर गए थे. मोदी उसी पतंग की डोर को काटने की कोशिश में लगे हैं. मोदी और पुतिन की होने वाली मुलाकात चीन को पक्का खटकेगा. वजह है कि मोदी जिनपिंग से नहीं मिलेंगे, मगर करीब कजाकस्तान से 2800 किलोमीटर दूर जाकर मॉस्को में पुतिन से मिलेंगे.\n\nएससीओ समिट में शामिल नहीं होंगे मोदी\n\nदरअसल, जुलाई के फर्स्ट वीक में एससीओ यानी शंघाई कोऑपरेटिव ऑर्गनाइजेशन की बैठक कजाकस्तान में होने वाली है. पहले खबर थी कि पीएम मोदी इस समिट में शामिल होंगे. मगर अब दावा किया जा रहा है कि प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी 3-4 जुलाई को अस्ताना में होने वाले एससीओ शिखर सम्मेलन में भाग नहीं लेंगे. इसकी वजह चीन और पाकिस्तान बताए जा रहे हैं. इस समिट में शी जिनपिंग और पाक के पीएम शहबाज शरीफ शामिल होंगे. चीन के साथ तकरार और पाकिस्तान के साथ आतंकवाद के मुद्दे को लेकर पीएम मोदी इस समिट से दूरी बना रहे हैं. पीएम मोदी चाहते तो अस्ताना में ही वह पुतिन से मुलाकात कर सकते थे. मगर उन्होंने दोस्त के लिए अलग से समय निकालना ही सही समझा. वैसे भी रूस काफी समय से पीएम मोदी को बुला रहा था. एससीओ समिट में शामिल न होने की एक वजह संसद सत्र भी बताई जा रही है. मोदी लगातार तीसरी बार पीएम बने हैं. ऐसे में संसद सत्र उनके लिए ज्यादा अहम है.\n\nभारत और रूस की दोस्ती और चीन की टेंशन\n\nयूक्रेन जंग के दौरान जब रूस पर प्रतिबंधों की मार पड़ी, भारत ने बिना किसी से डरे उसका साथ दिया. जब कोई तेल खरीदने वाला नहीं था, तब भारत ने उससे तेल खरीदे. इससे रूस को यूक्रेन जंग लड़ने में मदद मिली. रूस भारत का सबसे बड़ा रक्षा उपकरण सप्लायर रहा है. हालांकि, हाल के वर्षों में भारत ने अपनी क्षमताओं को बढ़ाने और विविधता लाने के प्रयास में अमेरिका समेत यूरोपीय देशों के साथ भी अरबों डॉलर के रक्षा सौदे किए हैं. भारत और रूस के बीच द्विपक्षीय व्यापार बढ़ रहा है. रूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध छिड़ने के बाद से इसमें उल्लेखनीय उछाल आया है, जो रिकॉर्ड ऊंचाई पर पहुंच गया है. भारत और रूस के बीच व्यापार करीब $50 बिलियन के करीब पहुंच गया है. यह इसलिए संभव हुआ है क्योंकि भारत को रियायती दरों पर रूसी तेल और उर्वरकों की आपूर्ति की गई. अब जब पीएम मोदी और पुतिन की एक बार फिर मुलाकात होने वाली है तो चीन का टेंशन बढ़ना लाजिमी है. एससीओ समिट में पीएम मोदी खुद न जाकर एक चीन को एक रणनीतिक संकेत देना चाहते हैं.",

This visit is significant as it marks Modi's first trip to Moscow since the Russia-Ukraine war began. Despite international pressure and sanctions on Russia, India has maintained its friendship with Russia, supporting it during the conflict. Modi's decision to visit Putin instead of attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in Kazakhstan, where he would have met Chinese President Xi Jinping, sends a strategic message. Modi aims to demonstrate India's independent foreign policy and solidify its ties with Russia, countering China's growing influence over Russia. This move is expected to increase tensions with China, especially since Modi is skipping the SCO Summit due to issues with China and Pakistan. The visit underscores India's commitment to its longstanding relationship with Russia, which has been a key defense supplier and trade partner."

        "title": "5 साल बाद रूस जाएंगे पीएम मोदी, पुतिन के करीबी ने की घोषणा; तरीखों का ऐलान जल्द",
        "body": "प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी अगले महीने रूस की यात्रा पर जा सकते हैं। खुद रूसी राष्ट्रपति के कार्यालय ने इसकी जानकारी दी है। क्रेमलिन ने मंगलवार को घोषणा की कि प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी अगले महीने रूस की यात्रा पर जाने वाले हैं। व्लादिमीर पुतिन के विदेश मामलों के सहयोगी यूरी उशाकोव ने कहा कि भारतीय प्रधानमंत्री की यात्रा की तैयारी की जा रही है, लेकिन उन्होंने कोई तारीख नहीं बताई। अगर दौरा होता है तो करीब पांच वर्षों में भारतीय प्रधानमंत्री का यह पहला रूस दौरा होगा। मोदी ने सितंबर 2019 में रूस का दौरा किया था।\n\nउशाकोव ने कहा कि तारीख की घोषणा बाद में संयुक्त रूप से की जाएगी। हालांकि, प्रधानमंत्री मोदी की संभावित यात्रा पर भारतीय पक्ष की ओर से कोई पुष्टि नहीं की गई है। पीएम मोदी आखिरी बार 2019 में रूस के दौरा पर गए थे। हालांकि अब पीएम मोदी की यात्रा की योजना वार्षिक भारत-रूस शिखर सम्मेलन के लिए बनाई जा रही है। पुतिन ने इस साल मई में लगातार पांचवीं बार रूस के राष्ट्रपति के रूप में शपथ ली थी, जबकि नरेंद्र मोदी ने भी 9 जून को लगातार तीसरी बार भारत के प्रधानमंत्री के रूप में शपथ ली थी। अगर यह यात्रा होती है, तो यह फरवरी 2022 में यूक्रेन पर रूसी आक्रमण की शुरुआत के बाद से पीएम मोदी की पहली रूस यात्रा होगी।\n\nआरआईए नोवोस्ती समाचार एजेंसी की खबर के मुताबिक, क्रेमलिन के अधिकारी यूरी उशाकोव ने कहा ''मैं इस बात की पुष्टि कर सकता हूं कि हम भारतीय प्रधानमंत्री के दौरे की तैयारियां कर रहे हैं।'' अगर मोदी रूस जाते हैं तो वह और राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन तीन वर्षों के अंतराल के बाद भारत-रूस वार्षिक शिखर सम्मेलन करेंगे। भारत के प्रधानमंत्री और रूस के राष्ट्रपति के बीच यह वार्षिक शिखर सम्मेलन दोनों देशों के बीच रणनीतिक साझेदारी में उच्च स्तरीय संस्थागत संवाद तंत्र है। अब तक भारत और रूस के बीच क्रमश: एक दूसरे के देशों में 21 वार्षिक शिखर सम्मेलन हुए हैं। पिछला शिखर सम्मेलन नयी दिल्ली में छह दिसंबर 2021 को आयोजित किया गया था। राष्ट्रपति पुतिन शिखर सम्मेलन में शामिल होने के लिए भारत आए थे।\n\nपिछले सप्ताह विदेश मंत्रालय (एमईए) ने कहा कि रूस-यूक्रेन संघर्ष में दो और भारतीय नागरिक मारे गए, जिससे ऐसी मौतों की संख्या चार हो गई। इनकी मौत रूसी सेना की ओर से युद्ध लड़ते समय हुई। रिपोर्टों के अनुसार, लगभग 200 भारतीय नागरिकों को रूसी सेना में सुरक्षा सहायक के रूप में भर्ती किया गया था। नई दिल्ली ने रूसी सेना द्वारा भारतीय नागरिकों की आगे की भर्ती पर \"सत्यापित रोक\" की मांग की है।\n\nरूस भारत का एक पुराना सहयोगी है। यही वजह है कि भारत यूक्रेन पर आक्रमण के लिए रूस की निंदा करने से कतराता रहा है। नई दिल्ली ने अमेरिका के शुरुआती दबाव के बावजूद रूसी कच्चे तेल की खरीद को बढ़ा दिया है। भारत का कहना है कि घरेलू तेल की कीमतों को नियंत्रित करने के लिए ऐसा कदम उठाना आवश्यक है।",

The Kremlin announced the visit, with Yuri Ushakov, a foreign affairs aide to President Vladimir Putin, confirming preparations are underway, though specific dates have not been disclosed. This visit, if it occurs, will be for the annual India-Russia summit, the first since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last summit was held in New Delhi in December 2021. \n\nThe visit comes amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has resulted in the deaths of four Indian citizens fighting for the Russian army. India has requested a halt to the recruitment of its citizens by the Russian military. Despite international pressure, India has continued to purchase Russian crude oil to manage domestic prices, reflecting its longstanding strategic partnership with Russia."

Modi last visited Russia in September 2019, while Putin visited India in 2021 for the annual India-Russia summit. Their last meeting was in September 2022 at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Uzbekistan, where they discussed the Ukraine conflict.\n\nAdditionally, Russia is hosting the BRICS summit in Kazan in October, which Modi is expected to attend. The visit underscores the longstanding friendship between India and Russia, with India being a major purchaser of Russian arms."

        "body": "Union Budget 2O24: केंद्रीय बजट 2024-25ः केंद्र में नई सरकार बनने के बाद अब बजट पेश करने की तैयारी चल रही है। निरंतर वैश्विक अनिश्चितताओं, अमेरिका, यूरोप और अन्य जगहों पर संभावित आर्थिक मंदी और रूस-यूक्रेन व इजरायल-फिलिस्तीन, गाजा में चल रहे संघर्षों के बीच वित्त मंत्री निर्मला सीतारमण जुलाई 2024 के अंत तक मोदी सरकार का बजट पेश कर सकती हैं। इसको लेकर वो तैयारी कर रही हैं।\n\nइस बार के बजट में चुनौती साहसिक पहल और राजकोषीय विवेक के बीच संतुलन बनाने की है। मोदी सरकार को देश की जनता ने लगातार तीसरी बार जनादेश सौंपा है। हाल ही में, भारत के कॉरपोरेट क्षेत्र के प्रतिनिधियों ने दो घंटे की बजट पूर्व बैठक के दौरान वित्त मंत्री निर्मला सीतारमण के साथ व्यक्तियों पर आयकर का बोझ कम करने, पूंजीगत व्यय बढ़ाने और खाद्य मुद्रास्फीति को नियंत्रित करने के उपायों को लागू करने की मजबूती के साथ वकालत की थी।वित्त मंत्री सीतारमण के साथ बजट पूर्व चर्चा में उद्योग जगत के प्रतिनिधियों ने आर्थिक वृद्धि को बनाए रखने के लिए बुनियादी ढांचे के विकास पर अधिक ध्यान देने की आवश्यकता पर जोर दिया। उन्होंने एमएसएमई (सूक्ष्म, लघु और मध्यम उद्यम) क्षेत्र को मजबूत करने के महत्व पर भी प्रकाश डाला, जो भारतीय अर्थव्यवस्था और रोजगार के प्रमुख स्रोत के लिए महत्वपूर्ण है।यहां आइए केंद्रीय बजट 2024-25 से संबंधित कुछ ऐसे प्रश्नों के जवाब जानने की कोशिश करते हैं जो अक्सर पूछे जाते हैं।\n\nवित्त मंत्री निर्मला सीतारमण केंद्रीय बजट 2024-25 कब पेश करेंगी?\n\nजानकारों की मानें तो वित्त मंत्री निर्मला सीतारमण संभवतः जुलाई 2024 के अंत में संसद में केंद्रीय बजट 2024-2025 पेश करेंगी। इस संबंध में तारीख और समय अभी तक सार्वजनिक नहीं किया गया है। हालांकि यह तय है कि वित्त मंत्री जुलाई में ही संसद में बजट पेश करेंगी। लोकसभा के जारी सेशन के बीच ही सरकार बजट की तारीख पर अपना रुख साफ कर सकती है।\n\nबजट सत्र कब शुरू और समाप्त होगा?\n\n18वीं लोकसभा का पहला सत्र 24 जून से शुरू हो गया है जिसमें नवनिर्वाचित सदस्यों का शपथ ग्रहण, लोकसभा स्पीकर का चुनाव होने हैं। यह सत्र तीन जुलाई तक चलेगा। उम्मीद है कि इस सत्र के दौरान ही सरकार की ओर से बजट की तारीख पर स्थिति साफ कर दी जाएगी\n\nराष्ट्रपति बजट सत्र में दोनों सदनों को कब संबोधित करेंगी?\n\nराष्ट्रपति द्रौपदी मुर्मू 27 जून को लोकसभा और राज्यसभा की संयुक्त बैठक को संबोधित करेंगी।\n\nआर्थिक सर्वेक्षण क्या है?\n\nआर्थिक सर्वेक्षण देश की आर्थिक प्रगति का वार्षिक अवलोकन प्रदान करता है। साथ ही महत्वपूर्ण चुनौतियों को उजागर करता है और संभावित समाधानों का सुझाव भी देता है। इस वर्ष का सर्वेक्षण मुख्य आर्थिक सलाहकार डॉ. वी. अनंत नागेश्वरन के मार्गदर्शन में तैयार किया जा रहा है।\n\nअंतरिम बजट और पूर्ण बजट में क्या होता है अंतर?\n\nअंतरिम बजट एक अस्थायी वित्तीय खाका है जिसे अल्प अवधि के लिए खर्चों को कवर करने के लिए डिजाइन किया जाता है। आमतौर पर जब तक नई सरकार कार्यभार नहीं संभालत लेती है तब तक के लिए अंतरिम बजट के जरिए खर्चों का प्रावधान किया जाता है। चूंकि वित्तीय वर्ष 31 मार्च को समाप्त हुआ और जून की शुरुआत में एक नई सरकार ने पदभार संभाला। इसलिए इस अवधि के खर्चों के संचालन के लिए वित्त मंत्री निर्मला सीतारमण ने 1 फरवरी 2024 को अंतरिम बजट पेश किया था। इस बजट से यह सुनिश्चित किया गया कि उक्त अविधि में वित्तीय संचालन सुचारू रूप से जारी रहे। अब जब नई सरकार का गठन हो गया है तो शेष वित्तीय वर्ष के लिए एक व्यापक बजट जुलाई में पेश किया जाएगा।\n\nराजकोषीय घाटा क्या है होता है?\n\nएक राजकोषीय घाटा एक वित्तीय वर्ष के भीतर सरकार के कुल राजस्व और उसके कुल खर्च के बीच के अंतर को दर्शाता है। यह घाटा इस बात पर प्रकाश डालता है कि सरकार का खर्च उसकी कमाई से कितना अधिक है। यह ध्यान रखना महत्वपूर्ण है कि कुल राजस्व की गणना करते समय, उधार को बाहर रखा जाता है।",

The budget aims to balance bold initiatives with fiscal prudence, following the Modi government's third consecutive electoral mandate.\n\nKey discussions in pre-budget meetings with corporate representatives included reducing income tax burdens, increasing capital expenditure, and controlling food inflation. Emphasis was also placed on infrastructure development and strengthening the MSME sector, crucial for economic growth and employment.\n\nThe first session of the 18th Lok Sabha began on June 24, 2024, and will run until July 3, 2024, during which the budget date is expected to be clarified. President Droupadi Murmu will address a joint session of both houses on June 27, 2024.\n\nThe Economic Survey, prepared under Chief Economic Advisor Dr. V. Anantha Nageswaran, will provide an annual review of the country's economic progress and challenges. An interim budget was presented on February 1, 2024, to cover expenses until the new government took office. The comprehensive budget for the remaining fiscal year will be presented in July.\n\nThe fiscal deficit, representing the gap between the government's total revenue and expenditure within a financial year, highlights the extent to which government spending exceeds its earnings, excluding borrowings."

        "body": "Gems and Jewellery Export: जेम्स एंड ज्वैलरी एक्सपोर्ट प्रमोशन काउंसिल (GJEPC) ने मई 2024 में रत्नों और गहनों के आयात और निर्यात का आंकड़ा जारी किया है. मई में भारत का एक्सपोर्ट जहां घट गया है वहीं आयात यानी इंपोर्ट में भारी इजाफा देखा गया है. GJEPC ने बताया है कि मई में भारत से आयात 15794.26 करोड़ रुपये रहा है जो कि इससे पिछले साल की तुलना में 23.61 फीसदी अधिक है. पिछले साल मई में ये आयात 12625.59 करोड़ रुपये पर रहा था.\n\nअगर इसे डॉलर में देखें तो मई 2024 में जेम्स एंड ज्वैलरी इंपोर्ट 1894.4 मिलियन यूएस डॉलर पर आया है जबकि ठीक एक साल पहले यानी मई 2023 में ये आंकड़ा 1532.61 मिलियन यूएस डॉलर का रहा था.\n\nआयात तो बेतहाशा बढ़ा है लेकिन बीते महीने जेम्स एंड ज्वैलरी एक्सपोर्ट में बड़ी गिरावट दर्ज की गई है. इस साल मई में जेम्स एंड ज्वैलरी एक्सपोर्ट 20713.370 करोड़ रुपये रहा है जबकि एक साल पहले मई में निर्यात 21795.65 करोड़ रुपये पर रहा था. डॉलर टर्म में देखें तो बीते महीने 2484.48 मिलियन यूएस डॉलर का एक्सपोर्ट रहा जबकि इससे पिछले साल ये 2646.92 मिलियन यूएस डॉलर पर रहा था.\n\nकामा ज्वैलरी के एमडी कॉलिन शाह का कहना है कि आर्थिक अस्थिरता इसकी बड़ी वजह है. जेम्स एंड ज्वैलरी इंडस्ट्री इस समय चुनौतीपूर्ण समय से जूझ रही है और ये लगभग एक साल से जारी है. रूस-यूक्रेन के युद्ध के चलते जियो-पॉलिटिकल टेंशन के साथ-साथ अब इजरायल-हमास संघर्ष ने एक्सपोर्ट पर गहरा निगेटिव असर डाला है. ओवरसीज मार्केट में मांग बेहद नीचे आई है जिसका असर ज्वैलरी के निर्यात के गिरने के तौर पर सामने आया है.\n\nकॉलिन शाह ने एक बड़ी अहम बात बताई है कि इस साल 60 से ज्यादा देशों में चुनाव होने हैं. भारत, इटली जैसे देशों में जनरल इलेक्शन हो भी चुके हैं और कई राष्ट्र नई सरकारें चुनने के लिए तैयारी में हैं. इसके असर से भी चुनावी देशों और उनसे जुड़े राष्ट्रों मे ट्रेड पर असर देखा गया है. हमको इससे जुड़े इवेंट्स पर भी नजर रखनी होगी लिहाजा हम पूरे साल के लिए कारोबारी गतिविधि के बारे में फैसला ले सकेंगे. हालांकि आने वाले समय में त्योहारी सीजन के चलते ट्रेड एक्टिविटी में तेजी आने की पूरी उम्मीद है.\n\nये भी पढ़ें",

        "summary": "In May 2024, India's import of gems and jewellery surged by 23.61% compared to the previous year, reaching ₹15,794.26 crore (approximately $1,894.4 million USD). However, exports in the same sector saw a decline, dropping to ₹20,713.37 crore (around $2,484.48 million USD) from ₹21,795.65 crore (about $2,646.92 million USD) in May 2023. Colin Shah, MD of Kama Jewellery, attributed this decline to economic instability and geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict, which have negatively impacted overseas demand. Additionally, the upcoming elections in over 60 countries, including India and Italy, have also affected trade. Despite these challenges, there is optimism for increased trade activity during the upcoming festive season."

        "body": "रूस में पिछले चार महीने में दो बड़े आतंकी हमले हुए हैं. 22 मार्च को मॉस्को के क्रोकस सिटी हॉल में हमला हुआ था जबकि 24 जून को दागिस्तान के दो शहरों पर आतंकी हमला हुआ है. दोनों हमलों में बड़े पैमाने पर लोग मारे गए. क्रोकस सिटी हमले में 145 लोगों की मौत हुई थी जबकि 500 से ज्यादा लोग घायल हुए थे. दागिस्तान आतंकी हमले में अब तक 17 लोगों की मौत हुई है जबकि 25 से ज्यादा लोग घायल हो गए. ऐसे में सबसे बड़ा सवाल यही है कि क्या युद्ध लड़ते-लड़ते रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन कमजोर पड़ गए?\n\nपुतिन के पांचवीं बार राष्ट्रपति बनने के बाद चार महीने में रूस में जिस तरह से दो बड़ी आतंकी घटना हुई है, उससे ऐसा लगता है कि पुतिन उस तरह से चीजों को हैंडिल नहीं कर पा रहे हैं. दागिस्तान में जिस तरीके का और जिस बड़े पैमाने पर आतंकी ऑपरेशन हुआ है, इससे लगता ये है कि दागिस्तान में जो आतंकी संगठन हैं, उसे कहीं न कहीं बाहर से जरूर कोई सपोर्ट मिला होगा. पुतिन पिछले ढाई साल से यूक्रेन से युद्ध का सामना कर रहे हैं. 22 फरवरी 2022 से शुरू हुआ युद्ध अब तलक जारी है. इतने दिनों के इस युद्ध में दोनों देशों में हजारों लोगों की मौतें हुई हैं जबकि घायलों की तादाद तो काफी ज्यादा है.\n\nयुद्ध में नुकसान रूस से ज्यादा यूक्रेन को हुआ है, इसके बावजूद यूक्रेन अभी तक हार नहीं मानी है और इस युद्ध में डटा हुआ है. रूस यूक्रेन युद्ध के कारण दुनिया में पुतिन की छवी को भी धक्का लगा है. दुनिया के कई मुल्कों खासकर पश्चिमी देशों ने रूस पर अलग अलग तरह के प्रतिबंध लगा दिए हैं. यूक्रेन के साथ जंग की वजह से पश्चिमऔर रूस के संबंध अपने सबसे खराब स्तर पर हैं. यूक्रेन से जारी जंग के बीच 17 मार्च 2024 को पुतिन पांचवीं बार राष्ट्रपति पद का चुनाव जीते. 87% वोट मिले. इस जीत के बाद उन्होंने तुरंत नाटो को चेतावनी दी थी. उन्होंने कहा था कि रूस और NATO के बीच अगर सीधा टकराव होता है कि तो यह तीसरे विश्वयुद्ध की तरफ पहला कदम होगा.\n\nहालांकि, इसके कुछ ही दिन बाद उन्होंने उन्होंने कहा कि रूस की किसी भी नाटो देश पर हमला करने की कोई योजना नहीं है, लेकिन उन्होंने चेतावनी दी कि अगर यूक्रेन में एफ-16 लड़ाकू विमानों ने लड़ाकू उड़ानें भरीं तो मास्को की सेना नाटो के ठिकानों को निशाना बना सकती है. दरअसल, नाटो देश इस युद्ध में यूक्रेन को लगातार सपोर्ट कर रहा है और यह सपोर्ट जंग की शुरुआत से ही करते आया है. नाटो देश बड़े पैमाने पर यूक्रेन को हथियार मुहैया कर रहा है. नाटो कंट्री में अगर कोई यूक्रेन को सबसे ज्यादा सपोर्ट करता है तो वह अमेरिका है.\n\nअमेरिका ने लगातार यूक्रेन को मानवीय, आर्थिक और सैन्य सहायता प्रदान की है. यह बात भी सही है कि यूक्रेन नाटो के दम पर ही इस युद्ध में अभी तक टिका है. इस युद्ध में अब तक न पुतिन की जीत हुई है और न जेलेंस्की की हार, इसके बावजूद जंग जारी है और यह जंग कब तक जारी रहेगी, यह कहना फिलहाल मुश्किल है. कुछ महीनों में खत्म होने वाला जंग इतना लंबा चलेगा शायद यह अंदाजा पुतिन को भी नहीं था. मगर युद्ध तो युद्ध है और पुतिन का कहना है कि वह हर हाल में इस युद्ध को जीतना चाहते हैं लेकिन जेलेंस्की भी हार मानने को राजी नहीं है.\n\nपुतिन 24 साल से रूस की सत्ता पर काबिज हैं. पहला राष्ट्रपति चुनाव उन्होंने 2000 में जीता था. उन्हें 53 फीसदी वोट मिले थे. 17 मार्च को उन्होंने पांचवीं बार रूस के राष्ट्रपति पद का चुनाव जीता. 7 मई को उन्होंने कामकाज शुरू की. 17 मार्च को पुतिन चुनाव जीते और 22 मार्च को मॉस्को के मशहूर कॉन्सर्ट हॉल क्रोकस सिटी पर हमला हो गया. कॉन्सर्ट हॉल में अचानक से चार पांच आतंकी घुस आए और अंधाधुंध फायरिंग शुरू कर दी.\n\nकॉन्सर्ट हॉल में बंदूकधारियों ने ऑटोमैटिक हथियारों से कॉन्सर्ट में आए लोगों पर गोलीबारी की और फिर हॉल में आग लगा दी, जिसके बाद पूरे कॉम्प्लेक्स में तेजी से आग फैल गई. इस हमले में सैंकड़ों लोग मारे गए. इस्लामिक स्टेट ने हमले की जिम्मेदारी ली थी. इसे साथ ही उसने टेलीग्राम चैनल के जरिए यह भी दावा किया था कि हमले को अंजाम देकरउसके आतंकी अपने ठिकानों पर वापस लौट गए हैं. इस हमले के चार महीने बाद रूस के दागिस्तान में फिर हमला हो गया.",

The first attack occurred on March 22 at Moscow's Crocus City Hall, resulting in 145 deaths and over 500 injuries. The second attack took place on June 24 in two cities in Dagestan, killing 17 and injuring more than 25 people. These incidents suggest that terrorist organizations in Dagestan might be receiving external support.\n\nPutin, who has been in power for 24 years and recently won his fifth presidential term on March 17, 2024, with 87% of the vote, has been engaged in the war with Ukraine since February 22, 2022. Despite significant losses, Ukraine continues to resist, bolstered by substantial support from NATO countries, particularly the United States. The prolonged conflict has damaged Putin's international image and strained Russia's relations with Western nations, leading to various sanctions.\n\nPutin has warned NATO against direct confrontation, suggesting it could lead to World War III, but also stated that Russia has no plans to attack NATO countries unless provoked by actions such as the deployment of F-16 fighter jets in Ukraine. The war shows no signs of ending soon, with neither Putin achieving a decisive victory nor Ukrainian President Zelensky conceding defeat."

        "summary": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is rapidly repatriating its gold reserves from abroad, resulting in the lowest level of overseas gold holdings in six years. As of March 2024, 47% of India's total gold reserves were held abroad, the lowest since December 2017. The RBI had accelerated gold purchases in December 2017 and is now focused on bringing more of this gold back to India.\n\nRecently, the RBI made headlines by repatriating a significant amount of gold from the UK, approximately 100 tons. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das stated that this move is not unexpected, citing increased domestic storage capacity as the reason.\n\nHowever, market analysts link this strategy to the Russia-Ukraine war, noting that Western countries, led by the U.S., imposed economic sanctions on Russia and seized its foreign assets. The RBI aims to preemptively safeguard India's assets from similar risks.\n\nAs part of its strategy to bolster foreign exchange reserves, the RBI has purchased record amounts of gold in recent years. By March, the RBI held over 822 tons of gold, with 53% now stored domestically, up from 39% in September 2021."

In Sevastopol, two people, including a two-year-old child, were killed, and 22 others were injured due to missile fragments. The attack involved five missiles intercepted by Russian air defense, but debris caused damage and fires. In Belgorod, a drone attack killed one person and injured three. These attacks followed a Russian assault on Kharkiv, Ukraine, which resulted in three deaths and around 30 injuries. The ongoing conflict began on February 24, 2022, when Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine, leading to global divisions and support for Ukraine from NATO countries, while Russia received indirect support from nations like China and Iran. India has remained neutral, advocating for an end to the war."

This has heightened global fears of a nuclear conflict.\n\n2. **Iran and the Middle East**: Iran's nuclear ambitions are a significant concern. Experts warn that if Iran develops nuclear weapons, it could trigger a regional arms race. The future stance of Iran's leadership on nuclear policy remains uncertain.\n\n3. **South Asia**: The ongoing tensions between nuclear-armed Pakistan, India, and China could potentially lead to a nuclear war. Pakistan is prepared to use nuclear weapons first, while India is enhancing its missile capabilities. Historical conflicts and recent incidents, like India's accidental missile launch into Pakistan, exacerbate these risks.\n\n4. **Pakistan**: Beyond its conflict with India, Pakistan's political instability and presence of terrorist groups pose a global threat. There are concerns about the control of nuclear weapons in the event of a leadership change or coup.\n\n5. **Russia-Ukraine War**: The conflict has persisted for two years, with Western support for Ukraine angering Russia. Experts fear that if Russia feels it is losing, it might resort to using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n6. **North Korea**: Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un continues to expand North Korea's nuclear capabilities, posing a threat to the US and Western countries. North Korea reportedly has around 50 nuclear weapons, with the potential to increase this number.\n\nThe article underscores the precarious state of global security due to the proliferation and potential use of nuclear weapons by various nations."

        "summary": "A video from the Russia-Ukraine war has surfaced, showing three Russian soldiers walking through an open field when a small drone attacks the middle soldier, causing a severe injury. The injured soldier, in a display of immense courage, signals his comrade to shoot him in the head to avoid capture and torture. The comrade complies, shooting him with an AK-series assault rifle.\n\nThe war has resulted in significant casualties and losses for both sides. Reports suggest that around 500,000 Russian soldiers and 50,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died, though these figures are unverified. Russia has also lost substantial military equipment, including tanks, aircraft, and drones. The ongoing conflict has led to the creation of over 70 new cemeteries in Russia since February 2022."

        "body": "Russia-Ukraine War: रूस और यूक्रेन के बीच पिछले काफी लंबे समय से युद्ध जारी है. इस बीच, शनिवार को रूस ने एक बार फिर यूक्रेन पर हमला कर दिया. हमला यूक्रेन के प्रमुख शहर खार्किव में हुआ है. हमले में तीन लोगों की मौत हो गई तो वहीं करीब 30 लोग घायल हो गए. यूक्रेन के राष्ट्रपति वोलोडिमिर जेलेंस्की ने एक क्षतिग्रस्त बिल्डिंग की एक फोटो सोशल मीडिया पर साझा की. उन्होंने कहा कि रूस ने एक बार फिर खार्किव पर हमला कर दिया. हमले में तीन लोगों की मौत हो गई.\n\nजेलेंस्की ने साझेदारों से किया आग्रह\n\nटेलीग्राम पर जेलेंस्की ने कहा कि रूस के आतंक और हमलों को रोका जाना चाहिए. हम अपने साझेदारों से आतंक के खिलाफ मजबूत निर्णय लेने का आग्रह करते हैं, जिससे हम रूसी लड़ाकू विमानों को नष्ट कर सके. इसके अलावा, यूक्रेन के आंतरिक मंत्री इगोर क्लिमेंको ने बताया कि हमले में 29 लोग घायल हुए हैं. दो बच्चों को अस्पताल में भर्ती कराया गया है. हमले में बुनियादी ढांचे को नुकसान पहुंचा है.\n\nयूक्रेन के ऊर्जा सुविधाओं पर रूस का हमल\n\nयूक्रेन की सेना का कहना है कि रूस ने हमारे कई क्षेत्रों में ऊर्जा अवसंरचना पर 16 क्रूज मिसाइलों और 13 हमलावर ड्रोनों को भी लॉन्च किया. यूक्रेनी ऊर्जा मंत्रालय का कहना है कि तीन महीनों में यह रूस का ऊर्जा अवसंरचना सुविधाओं पर आठवां बड़ा हमला है.\n\nरूस ने की हमले की पुष्टि\n\nमामले में रूस ने कहा कि उन्होंने यूक्रेनी ऊर्जा सुविधाओं पर ड्रोन से हमला किया है. रूसी रक्षा मंत्रालय ने बताया कि हमने गोला-बारूद रखने वाले गोदामों को निशाना बनाया है, इन गोदामों में पश्चिमी देशों द्वारा दिए गए हथियार भी रखे हुए थे. जेलेंस्की की मानें तो रूसी हमलों ने यूक्रेन की आधी ऊर्जा क्षमता को बर्बाद कर दिया है.\n\nरूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध कैसे शुरू हुआ था?\n\nरूस के राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन ने 23 फरवरी 2022 की रात को यूक्रेन के खिलाफ जंग का एलान किया था. 24 फरवरी की तड़के यूक्रेन की राजधानी कीव और आसपास के शहरों में हवाई हमले होने लगे. रूस के हमलों से दुनिया में हड़कंप मच गया. इसके बाद यूक्रेन ने भी जवाबी कार्रवाई की. युद्ध के कारण दुनिया दो धड़ों में बंट गई. यूक्रेन के लिए नाटो देश साथ आ गए. अमेरिका, ब्रिटेन, पोलैंड, फ्रांस सहित कई देश अप्रत्यक्ष रूप से यूक्रेन को मदद देने लगे. वहीं, रूस की ओर से चीन, दक्षिण कोरिया, ईरान जैसे देश अप्रत्यक्ष रूप से साथ आ गए. हालांकि, भारत ने किसी का पक्ष नहीं लिया. विदेश मंत्री एस. जयशंकर ने भारत का पक्ष रखते हुए कहा कि भारत सार्वजनिक रूप से युद्ध की समाप्ति के लिए प्रतिबद्ध है.",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shared an image of a damaged building on social media and urged international partners to take decisive actions against Russian aggression. Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko confirmed the casualties and infrastructure damage. Additionally, Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure with missiles and drones, marking the eighth significant attack on such facilities in three months. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed they targeted ammunition depots containing Western-supplied weapons. The ongoing conflict, which began on February 24, 2022, has divided global alliances, with NATO countries supporting Ukraine and nations like China and Iran indirectly backing Russia. India has maintained a neutral stance, advocating for an end to the war."

        "body": "NATO Innovation Fund : रूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध, दुनियाभर में एडवांस्ड होते वेपन्स और वेपन्स में बढ़ता आर्टिफिशियल इंटेलिजेंस (AI) का इस्तेमाल अब हर देश को नए सिरे से सोचने पर मजबूर कर रहा है। नाटो (Nato) जिसका पूरा नाम नॉर्थ अटलांटिक ट्रीटी ऑर्गनाइजेशन है, उसके 32 में से 24 मेंबर्स ने कहा है कि अब वो 4 यूरोपीय टेक कंपनियों में निवेश करेंगे। 1 बिलियन यूरो (लगभग 89.52 अरब रुपयों) का यह निवेश एआई, स्पेस और रोबोटिक डिफेंस टेक के क्षेत्र में एडवांस्ड बनने के लिए किया जाएगा।\n\nएक रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, इस इन्वेस्टमेंट का मकसद डिफेंस और सिक्योरिटी के क्षेत्र में आ रही चुनौतियों का सॉल्यूशन ढूंढना है। यूरोन्यूज के अनुसार, नाटो ने साल 2022 में इस फंड (NATO Innovation Fund) का ऐलान किया, जब रूस ने यूक्रेन पर हमला बोला। फंड के जरिए डिफेंस टेक्नॉलजी डेवलप कर रहे स्टार्ट अप्स और उन टेक्नॉलजीज को खरीदने वाले सरकारी खरीदारों को कनेक्ट किया जाएगा और वो एक-दूसरे से डील कर पाएंगे।\n\nशुरुआत में जिन कंपनियों को इन्वेस्टमेंट मिली है, वो सभी यूरोप से हैं। इनमें जर्मनी की एआरएक्स रोबोटिक्स (ARX Robotics) शामिल है। यह अनमैन्ड रोबोट डिजाइन करती है।\n\nइसके अलावा, लंदन बेस्ड कंप्यूटर चिप मेकर कंपनी फ्रैक्टाइल (Fractile), आईकॉमैट (iComat) और स्पेस फोर्ज (Space Forge) को भी फंड मिला है। ये कंपनियां अंतरिक्ष के लिए मटीरियल्स तैयार करती हैं।\n\nनाटो इनोवेशन फंड के तहत चार वेंचर कैपिटल फंड में भी निवेश किया है। ये डीप टेक पर फोकस करते हैं। इनमें जॉइन कैपिटल, वीस्क्वायर्ड वेंचर्स, ओटीबी वेंचर्स और अल्पाइन स्पेस वेंचर्स शामिल हैं। खास यह है कि नाटो करीब 15 साल तक इनमें निवेश करेगा। रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, इनोवेटर्स और मिलिट्री के बीच एक गैप है, जिसे भरने की जरूरत है। एक ओर, मिलिट्री को नहीं पता होता कि लेटेस्ट डिफेंस टेक्नॉलजीज क्या है। दूसरी ओर, इनोवेटर्स को मिलिट्री की जरूरतों का पता नहीं चलता। जब दोनों आपस में कनेक्ट करेंगे, तो आउटपुट अच्छा निकलने की उम्मीद है।\n\nइसके अलावा, सरकारें आमतौर पर किसी भी प्रोजेक्ट में तेजी से आगे नहीं बढ़तीं। नाटो का इन्वेस्टमेंट फंड बिना सरकारी रुकावट के तेजी से काम करेगा। लेकिन खास बात यह भी है कि अमेरिका, कनाडा और फ्रांस जैसे बड़े नाटो देश इस फंड को सपोर्ट नहीं कर रहे।",

Out of NATO's 32 members, 24 have agreed to invest in four European tech companies: Germany's ARX Robotics, London's Fractile, iComat, and Space Forge. The fund also invests in four venture capital funds focusing on deep tech: Join Capital, Vsquared Ventures, OTB Ventures, and Alpine Space Ventures. The initiative seeks to bridge the gap between military needs and technological innovations, facilitating faster project execution without government delays. However, major NATO countries like the USA, Canada, and France do not support this fund."

        "body": "India-Russia Relations: भारत ने शुक्रवार (21 जून) को कहा कि रूसी सेना में काम करने वाले भारतीय नागरिकों का मुद्दा अत्यधिक चिंता का विषय बना हुआ है. नई दिल्ली ने इस पर मॉस्को से कार्रवाई की मांग की है. पिछले हफ्ते विदेश मंत्रालय ने कहा था कि रूस-यूक्रेन संघर्ष में रूसी सेना में कार्यरत दो और भारतीय नागरिक मारे गए हैं, जिससे ऐसी मौतों की संख्या चार हो गई है.\n\nदो भारतीयों की मौत के बाद भारत ने रूसी सेना से भारतीय नागरिकों की भर्ती न करने को कहा था. विदेश मंत्रालय के प्रवक्ता रणधीर जायसवाल ने अपने साप्ताहिक संवाददाता सम्मेलन में कहा, ''हमने रूसी सेना द्वारा भर्ती किए गए भारतीयों की शीघ्र रिहाई और उनकी स्वदेश वापसी के लिए रूसी पक्ष के साथ मामला उठाया है. हमने भर्ती पर सत्यापित रोक लगाने की भी मांग की है.''\n\nखबरों के मुताबिक, करीब 200 भारतीय नागरिकों को रूसी सेना में सुरक्षा सहायक के तौर पर भर्ती किया गया है. जायसवाल ने कहा, 'हमारे प्रयासों के परिणामस्वरूप अब तक 10 भारतीय नागरिकों को रिहा कर दिया गया है और वापस भेज दिया गया है. हम इस मुद्दे पर नयी दिल्ली और मॉस्को दोनों जगह रूसी पक्ष के साथ संपर्क में हैं. उन्होंने कहा, 'यह हमारे लिए अत्यधिक चिंता का विषय बना हुआ है और हम कार्रवाई की उम्मीद करते हैं.'\n\nविदेश मंत्रालय के प्रवक्ता ने कहा कि भारत हाल ही में मारे गए दो भारतीयों के शवों को शीघ्र वापस लाने के लिए रूसी पक्ष के साथ काम कर रहा है. उन्होंने कहा, 'जारी संघर्ष में अब तक चार भारतीय नागरिक मारे गए हैं. हम हाल ही में मारे गए दो भारतीयों के शवों को शीघ्र वापस लाने के लिए रूसी पक्ष के साथ काम कर रहे हैं.' जायसवाल ने कहा, 'हम उनके परिवार के सदस्यों के भी संपर्क में हैं.'\n\nविदेश मंत्रालय ने शुक्रवार को फ्रांसीसी पत्रकार सेबेस्टियन फार्सिस के इस दावे का भी खंडन किया कि उन्हें भारत छोड़ने के लिए मजबूर किया गया. जायसवाल ने कहा कि 'वर्क परमिट' के नवीनीकरण के लिए फार्सिस का आवेदन अभी भी विचाराधीन है. उन्होंने कहा, 'फार्सिस 'ओसीआई कार्ड' धारक हैं और हमारे नियमों के तहत उन्हें पत्रकारिता संबंधी कार्य करने के लिए अनुमोदन की आवश्यकता होती है.'\n\nजायसवाल ने कहा कि फार्सिस ने मई 2024 में वर्क परमिट के नवीनीकरण के लिए फिर से आवेदन किया है और उनका मामला विचाराधीन है. विदेश मंत्रालय ने इसके साथ ही एबीसी न्यूज द्वारा बनाई गई एक डॉक्यूमेंट्री की सामग्री को सरासर झूठ बताया, जिसमें ऑस्ट्रेलिया की 'राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा' में हस्तक्षेप करने के भारतीय खुफिया एजेंटों के कथित प्रयासों को उजागर करने का दावा किया गया है.\n\nजायसवाल ने कहा कि डॉक्यूमेंट्री में सरासर झूठी बातें कही गई हैं और यह भारत को बदनाम करने के लिए एक विशेष एजेंडे को पूरा करती प्रतीत होती है. उन्होंने कहा, 'हम स्पष्ट रूप से आतंकवाद को नजरअंदाज करने, उसे उचित ठहराने और यहां तक कि उसका महिमामंडन करने के ऐसे किसी भी प्रयास का विरोध करते हैं.'",

The Indian Ministry of External Affairs is also working to repatriate the bodies of the recently deceased Indians and is in contact with their families. Additionally, the ministry refuted claims by French journalist Sebastien Farcis about being forced to leave India, clarifying that his work permit renewal application is still under consideration. The ministry also dismissed an ABC News documentary alleging Indian intelligence interference in Australia's national security as false and aimed at discrediting India."

        "body": "भारत ने शुक्रवार को कहा कि रूसी सेना में काम करने वाले भारतीय नागरिकों का मुद्दा चिंता का विषय बना हुआ है. दिल्ली ने इस पर मॉस्को से कार्रवाई की मांग की है. पिछले हफ्ते, विदेश मंत्रालय ने कहा था कि रूस-यूक्रेन संघर्ष में रूसी सेना में कार्यरत दो और भारतीय नागरिक मारे गए हैं, जिससे ऐसी मौतों की संख्या चार हो गई है.\n\nदो भारतीयों की मौत के बाद भारत ने रूसी सेना से भारतीय नागरिकों की भर्ती न करने को कहा था. विदेश मंत्रालय के प्रवक्ता रणधीर जायसवाल ने अपने प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस में कहा कि हमने रूसी सेना द्वारा भर्ती किए गए भारतीयों की शीघ्र रिहाई और उनकी स्वदेश वापसी के लिए रूसी पक्ष के साथ मामला उठाया है. हमने भर्ती पर रोक लगाने की भी मांग की है.\n\nखबरों के मुताबिक, करीब 200 भारतीय नागरिकों को रूसी सेना में सुरक्षा सहायक के तौर पर भर्ती किया गया है. रणधीर जायसवाल ने कहा कि हमारे प्रयासों के परिणामस्वरूप, अब तक 10 भारतीय नागरिकों को रिहा कर दिया गया है और वापस भेज दिया गया है. हम इस मुद्दे पर नयी दिल्ली और मॉस्को दोनों जगह रूसी पक्ष के साथ संपर्क में हैं.\n\nउन्होंने कहा कि यह हमारे लिए अत्यधिक चिंता का विषय बना हुआ है और हम कार्रवाई की उम्मीद करते हैं. विदेश मंत्रालय के प्रवक्ता ने कहा कि भारत हाल ही में मारे गए दो भारतीयों के शवों को शीघ्र वापस लाने के लिए रूसी पक्ष के साथ काम कर रहा है. उन्होंने कहा कि जारी संघर्ष में अब तक चार भारतीय नागरिक मारे गए हैं. हम हाल ही में मारे गए दो भारतीयों के शवों को शीघ्र वापस लाने के लिए रूसी पक्ष के साथ काम कर रहे हैं.\n\nरणधीर जायसवाल ने कहा कि हम उनके परिवार के सदस्यों के भी संपर्क में हैं. विदेश मंत्रालय ने शुक्रवार को फ्रांसीसी पत्रकार सेबेस्टियन फार्सिस के इस दावे का भी खंडन किया कि उन्हें भारत छोड़ने के लिए मजबूर किया गया. उन्होंने कहा कि वर्क परमिट के नवीनीकरण के लिए फार्सिस का आवेदन अभी भी विचाराधीन है. उन्होंने कहा क्फ फ़ार्सिस ओसीआई कार्ड धारक हैं और हमारे नियमों के तहत उन्हें पत्रकारिता संबंधी कार्य करने के लिए अनुमोदन की आवश्यकता होती है. जायसवाल ने कहा कि फ़ार्सिस ने मई 2024 में वर्क परमिट के नवीनीकरण के लिए फिर से आवेदन किया है और उनका मामला विचाराधीन है.\n\nविदेश मंत्रालय ने इसके साथ ही एबीसी न्यूज द्वारा बनाई गई एक डॉक्यूमेंट्री को 'सरासर झूठ' बताया, जिसमें ऑस्ट्रेलिया की 'राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा' में हस्तक्षेप करने के भारतीय खुफिया एजेंटों के कथित प्रयासों को उजागर करने का दावा किया गया है. जायसवाल ने कहा कि डॉक्यूमेंट्री में सरासर झूठी बातें कही गई हैं और यह भारत को 'बदनाम' करने के लिए एक विशेष एजेंडे को पूरा करती प्रतीत होती है. उन्होंने कहा कि हम स्पष्ट रूप से आतंकवाद को नजरअंदाज करने, उसे उचित ठहराने और यहां ताकि उसका महिमामंडन करने के ऐसे किसी भी प्रयास का विरोध करते हैं.",

So far, efforts have led to the release and return of 10 Indian nationals. India remains in contact with Russian authorities in both New Delhi and Moscow to address this issue.\n\nAdditionally, India is working with Russia to expedite the return of the bodies of the recently deceased Indian nationals. The Ministry of External Affairs is also in touch with the families of the deceased.\n\nIn a separate matter, the Ministry refuted claims by French journalist Sebastien Farcis that he was forced to leave India, clarifying that his work permit renewal application is still under consideration. Farcis, an OCI cardholder, requires approval for journalistic activities under Indian regulations.\n\nFurthermore, the Ministry dismissed an ABC News documentary alleging Indian intelligence agents' interference in Australia's national security as \"blatantly false\" and aimed at discrediting India.

        "body": "अमेरिका तिब्बत के बहाने चीन को घेर रहा है तो रूस, चीन और उत्तरी कोरिया एक धुरी बन रहे हैं. ईरान और सीरिया भी रूस-चीन से नाता जोड़ रहे हैं. सउदी अरब भी अमेरिकी दबाव से बाहर आने को व्याकुल है. यूक्रेन की लड़ाई से अब यूरोप भी ऊब चुका है. इजराइल के नेतन्याहू अमेरिकी चेतावनी को दरकिनार करते हुए हमास को बर्बाद करने पर तुले हैं. कुल मिलाकर दुनिया का कोई भी देश शांति के प्रयासों को लेकर गंभीर नहीं है. भारत ने यूक्रेन युद्ध में अपनी भूमिका तटस्थ रखी लेकिन तिब्बत वाले मुद्दे पर वह अमेरिकी कूटनीति के निकट जाने को आतुर है. प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी जिस तरह की गर्मजोशी के साथ अमेरिकी संसद के प्रतिनिधिमंडल से मिले, उससे यही संकेत मिलते हैं. इसमें कोई शक नहीं कि चीन अपने विस्तार के लिए जिस तरह से चालें चल रहा है, उसमें भारत को सतर्क रहने की जरूरत है.\n\nभारत ने 2003 में तिब्बत को चीन के अभिन्न भाग के रूप में स्वीकार किया था. उस समय भारत का अनुमान था कि इससे भारत-चीन कड़वाहट दूर होगी. मगर, शी जिंगपिंग के कार्यकाल में डोकलाम विवाद और अरुणाचल को लेकर चीन खुड़पेच करता ही रहा. अब तो भारत सीधे-सीधे चीन के खिलाफ अमेरिका का साथ देता दिख रहा है. खासकर दलाई लामा से मिलने आए अमेरिकी सांसदों की टोली से प्रधानमंत्री का मिलना और नैन्सी पेलोसी से बातचीत करना चीन को चुभा होगा.\n\nविदेश मंत्री एस. जयशंकर भी इन सांसदों से मिले. इससे एक इशारा हो गया कि शी जिनपिंग को भारत जवाब देना चाहता है. भारत रूस के साथ अपने रिश्ते कतई नहीं बिगाड़ना चाहता. यही कारण है कि प्रधानमंत्री जी-20 के सम्मेलन में रूस-यूक्रेन युद्ध पर चुप लगा गए. अभी 12 जून को जी-7 सम्मेलन में भी इस मुद्दे पर चुप रहे. जी-7 की बैठक में नरेंद्र मोदी को बतौर विशिष्ट अतिथि बुलाया गया था. भारत अभी जी-7 के समूह में नहीं पहुंच सका है.\n\nअमेरिका अगर चीन को घेरने की कोशिश में है तो चीन कोई चुप नहीं बैठेगा. अमेरिका के खिलाफ एशिया में एक तगड़ी लॉबी तैयार हो रही है. रूस, चीन और उत्तर कोरिया अमेरिका के खिलाफ एकजुट हो रहे हैं. यूं रूस को यूरोपीय देश भले कहा जाए पर उसका बड़ा हिस्सा एशिया में है. उनका ऑर्थोडॉक्स चर्च भी इस्लामिक मस्जिद से मिलता-जुलता है. इसके अलावा ईरान और पश्चिम एशिया के सीरिया आदि भी अमेरिका के खिलाफ लामबंद होते जा रहे हैं. यह संकेत है कि हालात दूसरे विश्वयुद्ध की तरह बनते जा रहे हैं. एक तरफ अमेरिका जैसे पश्चिमी देश और दूसरी तरफ एशियाई देश. पहले के दोनों विश्वयुद्ध यूरोप की जमीन पर लड़े गए इसलिए अमेरिका इस बार एशिया में यह विश्व युद्ध करवाने की आशंकाएं प्रबल कर रहा है.\n\nआधुनिक दुनिया में मानचित्र बदल गया है. कोई तीन सौ साल से दुनिया में संपन्नता, समृद्धि और विकास के शिखर पर बैठे यूरोप के गोरे लोगों का गुरूर टूट रहा है. हर यूरोपीय देश संकट के कगार पर है. फ़्रांस के राष्ट्रपति इमैनुएल मैक्रों ने हाल ही में कहा है कि यूरोप अब मर रहा है. 'Europe is dying' वाला उनका बयान खूब चर्चा में है. फ़्रांस, ब्रिटेन, जर्मनी उन मुल्कों में से हैं, जो सभ्यता और संस्कृति के सर्वोच्च शिखर पर हैं. इन तीनों की अर्थव्यवस्था पिछड़ रही है. चीन के तीव्र विकास के आगे सब फेल हैं. सामरिक रूप से अभी उसके पास परमाणु बमों का जखीरा भले न हो लेकिन समृद्धि में उसने इन यूरोपीय देशों को पीछे धकेल दिया है. चीन ने अपनी विशाल आबादी को काम से लगाया और सुई से लेकर हवाई जहाज आज वहां बन रहा है.\n\nइलेक्ट्रिक कारों की दुनिया में चीन ने आज जर्मनी को पीछे कर दिया है. यूरोप के बहुत सारे देश चीन से ढाह करते हैं. वह अब एशिया के सभी व्यापारिक जलमार्गों पर भी कब्जे की तैयारी में हैं. दक्षिण चीन सागर पर उसका कब्जा है तो श्रीलंका के बंदरगाह पर भी. दक्षिण चीन सागर पर कब्जे को लेकर पिछले दिनों फिलीपींस से उसका झगड़ा भी हुआ था. जर्मनी के हैम्बर्ग बंदरगाह पर चीन के COSCO के साथ समझौता किया हुआ है. स्थिति यह है कि जैसे 100 साल पहले ब्रिटेन का सारे समुद्रों पर कब्जा था, कुछ वैसी ही स्थिति चीन की बनती जा रही है. अमेरिका समझ रहा है अगर चीन के पर न कतरे गए तो कल को वह अमेरिका के व्यापारिक मार्गों पर भी अवरोध खड़ा कर सकता है. स्थिति यह है कि अमेरिका और कनाडा के बाजार चीनी सामानों से पटे पड़े हैं.\n\nइस बार अमेरिका ने चीन के खिलाफ भारत की जमीन को इस्तेमाल किया है. अमेरिका अगर तिब्बत की स्वायत्तता को लेकर इतना ही बेचैन है तो उसे दलाई लामा को वाशिंगटन बुलाकर अमेरिकी कांग्रेस द्वारा पास किए गए प्रस्ताव के बाबत जानकारी देनी थी लेकिन अमेरिकी संसद का प्रतिनिधिमंडल भारत आया और निर्वासित तिब्बत सरकार के मुख्यालय मैक्लोड गंज गया. कांगड़ा एयरपोर्ट पर अमेरिकी जहाज ने लैंडिंग की. शुक्र रहा कि उनकी अगवानी में भारत सरकार का कोई प्रतिनिधि नहीं गया. दलाई लामा से मिलते समय भी भारत का कोई अधिकारी वहां मौजूद नहीं था. यह भारत सरकार की विदेश नीति की सफलता थी. मगर जब यह शिष्टमंडल दिल्ली आया तो प्रधानमंत्री से भी मिला. हालांकि इसे शिष्टाचार मुलाकात कहा जा सकता है.\n\nयहां ध्यान रखने की बात यह है, अगर भारत यह समझता हो कि अमेरिका भारत के चिर शत्रु चीन को घेर रहा है तो यह बात वह दिमाग से निकाल दे. अमेरिका अपने हितों को लेकर खूब सतर्क रहता है. पिछले साल जून में प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी जब अमेरिका गए थे, उन्हीं दिनों अमेरिका के विदेश सचिव (मंत्री) एंटनी ब्लिंकन चीन पहुंचे हुए थे. एक तरफ जो. बाइडेन चीन के राष्ट्रपति शी जिनपिंग को सबसे बड़ा तानाशाह बताते नहीं थकते, दूसरी तरफ उसके साथ गलबहियां भी करते हैं. एंटनी ब्लिंकन शी जिनपिंग से भी मिले थे. उनके दौरे के बाद बाइडेन ने कहा था, एंटनी ब्लिंकन बहुत अच्छा काम कर रहे हैं. एक तरह से अमेरिका दो-धारी तलवार है. जिसके साथ न दोस्ती अच्छी न दुश्मनी. दलाई लामा से भेंट कर उसने चीन को अर्दब में लेने की कोशिश की तो भारत की जमीन का इस्तेमाल भी किया.\n\nयह पहली बार हुआ है कि अमेरिका ने चीन को धमकाने के लिए भारत की जमीन को अपना आधार बनाया. हालांकि नैन्सी पेलोसी पहले भी दलाई लामा से मिलने धर्मशाला गई थीं पर तब वो अकेले थीं. इस बार उनके साथ सात सदस्यीय प्रतिनिधिमंडल भी था. इसके बाद नैन्सी प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी से भी मिलीं. यह चीन को रास नहीं आया होगा. भारत को वैश्विक कूटनीति में अपने को निर्गुट रखना ही उपयोगी होगा. चीन भारत का सटा हुआ पड़ोसी है. 1962 के बाद से छिटपुट झड़पों के अतिरिक्त कोई युद्ध नहीं हुआ. चीन हर तरह से भारत की तुलना में इक्कीस है. इसलिए भारत को इन दोनों महाबलियों से दूरी बनानी होगी. अभी तक भारत चीन और रूस के मामले में बहुत सुरक्षित रास्ता अखित्यार करता रहा है. भारत अपनी इसी कूटनीति पर आगे बढ़े.",

        "summary": "The article discusses India's diplomatic strategies to counter China's influence. Key points include:\n\n1. **Global Alliances and Tensions**: The U.S. is using the Tibet issue to challenge China, while Russia, China, and North Korea are forming an alliance. Iran and Syria are also aligning with Russia and China. Saudi Arabia seeks independence from U.S. pressure, and Europe is weary of the Ukraine conflict. Israel's Netanyahu is defying U.S. warnings against Hamas.\n\n2. **India's Position**: India has maintained neutrality in the Ukraine war but is aligning with U.S. diplomacy on Tibet. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's warm reception of a U.S. congressional delegation signals this shift. India had recognized Tibet as part of China in 2003, hoping to ease tensions, but China's actions in Doklam and Arunachal Pradesh have kept relations strained.\n\n3. **Diplomatic Moves**: Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar also met with U.S. delegates, indicating India's intent to respond to China. Despite this, India aims to maintain good relations with Russia, as seen in Modi's silence on the Russia-Ukraine war at the G-20 and G-7 summits.\n\n4. **China's Global Influence**: China is expanding its influence in Asia and beyond, controlling key trade routes and ports. The U.S. fears China's growing power and is using India as a strategic base to counter it.\n\n5. **U.S.-India Relations**: The U.S. has used Indian soil to challenge China, with a U.S. delegation visiting the Tibetan government-in-exile in India. This move, while diplomatically sensitive, shows the U.S. leveraging India in its strategy against China.\n\n6. **Strategic Caution for India**: The article advises India to remain non-aligned, given its proximity to China and the complex global dynamics. India's cautious diplomacy with China and Russia has been beneficial and should continue.\n\nIn summary, India is navigating a complex diplomatic landscape, balancing relations with major powers while countering China's regional ambitions."

        "body": "यूक्रेन जंग के बाद राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन अपने देश के लोग पर एक और बोझ बढ़ाने जा रहे है. रूस की संसद ने गुरुवार को एक विधेयक को प्रारंभिक मंजूरी दी है, जिसमें रूस के अमीर तबके की आय पर टैक्स बढ़ाने की योजना बनाई गई है.\n\nरूस यूक्रेन जंग अपने तीसरे साल में आ चुकी है. अमेरिका और पश्चिमी देशों के दबाव के बावजूद रूस की आक्रामकता कम नहीं हुई है. रूस लगातार अपने अलायंस चीन, ईरान, उत्तर कोरिया के सहारे अमेरिकी प्रतिबंधों का मुकाबला करने की कोशिश कर रहा है. लेकिन देश में टेक्स बढ़ाने को लेकर उठाए जा रहे पुतिन के नए कदमों से जाहिर होने लगा है कि रूस पर भी जंग और प्रतिबंधों का बुरा असर हो रहा है. रूस की संसद ने गुरुवार को एक विधेयक को प्रारंभिक मंजूरी दी है, जिसमें रूस के अमीर तबके की आय पर टैक्स बढ़ाने की योजना बनाई गई है.\n\nइस बिल को रूस के निचले सदन स्टेट ड्यूमा में तीन रिडिंग में से पहली रिडिंग में पास किया गया. ये बिल ऐसे समय में पास हुआ है, जब रूस ने यूक्रेन की लड़ाई में भारी मात्रा में पैसा खर्च करना जारी रखा है. ये प्रस्ताव 2001 में लाए गए टैक्स बिल में बदलाव करेगा.\n\nबिल के जरिए स्लेब टैक्स सिस्टम को लाया जा रहा है, जिसके तहत सालाना 27,500 डॉलर (2.4 मिलियन रूबल) कमाने वाले लोगों के लिए 13 फीसदी मौजूदा दर से ही टैक्स वसूली की जाएगी. जबकि इस सीमा से ज्यादा कमाई करने वालों पर टैक्स की दर बढ़ती जाएगी. जिन लोगों की आय 573,000 डॉलर (50 मिलियन रूबल) से ज्यादा होगी उनसे 22 फीसदी टैक्स वसूला जाएगा तक पहुंच जाएगी. रूस के राष्ट्रपति पुतिन के मुताबिक ये बिल देश की महज 3.2 फीसद एलीट आबादी पर ही असर डालेगा.\n\nइनकम टैक्स के अलावा बिल में कॉर्पोरेट टैक्स की दर को 20 फीसदी से बढ़ाकर 25 फीसदी करने का प्रस्ताव है. अगर ये बिल लागू होता है, तो रूस के राजस्व में उल्लेखनीय वृद्धि देखने मिल सकती है, अनुमानों के मुताबिक इस बिल से 2025 तक 2.6 ट्रिलियन रूबल ($29 बिलियन) ज्यादा राजस्व को मिलेंगे. ये नया बिल रूस की आर्थिक और राजनीतिक चुनौतियों को दिखा रहा है कि यूक्रेन जंग और पश्चिमी प्रतिबंधों ने रूस के आर्थिक तौर पर कमजोर कर दिया है.",

The Russian parliament has given preliminary approval to a bill that plans to increase taxes on the income of the rich. This move comes as Russia enters the third year of its conflict with Ukraine, despite pressure from the U.S. and Western countries. The bill, which passed its first reading in the State Duma, aims to amend the 2001 tax law by introducing a slab tax system. Individuals earning over $27,500 annually will see increased tax rates, with those earning above $573,000 facing a 22% tax rate. Additionally, corporate tax rates will rise from 20% to 25%. This legislation is expected to significantly boost Russia's revenue by $29 billion by 2025, highlighting the economic strain caused by the war and Western sanctions."

        "body": "योग और आयुर्वेद के अलावा भारतीय ज्ञान परंपरा की एक और परंपरा ज्योतिष शास्त्र भी अब दुनियाभर में तेजी से प्रचलित हो रही है। किसी भी धर्म या पंथ को मानने वाले लोग भी ग्रह-नक्षत्र और तिथि-समय आधारित भविष्य गणना की इस विद्या के प्रति न सिर्फ आकर्षित हो रहे बल्कि भरोसा भी कर रहे हैं। खासतौर पर रूस के युवाओं में ज्योतिष के प्रति गजब का रुझान दिख रहा है। यहां 60 फीसदी से ज्यादा युवा 'कुंडली रेमिडी' (कुंडली उपचार) के जरिए अपनी समस्याओं का हल खोज रहे हैं।\n\nबीएचयू के संस्कृत विद्या धर्म विज्ञान संकाय के ज्योतिष विज्ञान विभागाध्यक्ष प्रो. विनय पांडेय हाल ही में रूस की राजधानी मॉस्को से लौटे हैं। ज्योतिष विज्ञान पर अंतरराष्ट्रीय कार्यशाला के दौरान उन्होंने ग्रहचाल गणना और ज्योतिष विज्ञान के आयामों पर प्रस्तुतियां दीं। रूस के युवाओं में भारतीय धर्म विज्ञान के प्रति रुझान देखकर प्रो. पांडेय चकित हैं।\n\nउन्होंने बताया कि 60 फीसदी से ज्यादा युवा ऐसे हैं जो सक्रिय रूप से कुंडली, ग्रह विज्ञान और इसके उपचारों के बारे में पूछ रहे हैं। यही नहीं, ग्रहशांति और कष्टों से मुक्ति के लिए वह मंत्रजाप और पूजापाठ पर विश्वास कर रहे हैं। कार्यशाला के दौरान विश्वविद्यालयों-संस्थानों के दर्जनों छात्र और नौकरीपेशा युवा ऐसे भी मिले जो रुद्रजाप, हनुमानजी की पूजा या भैरव पूजन के मंत्र-विधान और इनसे होने वाले लाभ के बारे में पूछ रहे थे। प्रौढ़ आयु वर्ग के कई लोगों ने उनके लिए पूजन की इच्छा भी जताई।\n\nयूपी के स्कूलों में पढ़ाया जाएगा संस्कृति का ककहरा, इन क्लासों में होगा कोर्स\n\nइन सवालों का हल तलाश रहे\n\n- हमारे जन्म और जीवन का लक्ष्य क्या है\n\n- जीवन में एक विश्वसनीय साथी की तलाश कब पूरी होगी\n\n- क्या मुझे अपने देश में ही रहना चाहिए या बाहर जाना चाहिए\n\n- कॅरियर के क्षेत्र में बदलाव करूं या इसी क्षेत्र में आगे बढूं\n\n- मानसिक तनाव से शांति के लिए क्या जाप कराए जाएं\n\n- रूस-यूक्रेन का युद्ध और कितने दिन चलेगा, इसका नतीजा क्या होगा\n\nयह है कारण\n\nरूस में ज्योतिष और धर्म के प्रसार के पीछे वहां की जीवनशैली को कारण माना जा रहा है। प्रो. विनय पांडेय ने बताया कि यहां 10 वर्ष की अवस्था तक बच्चों को राष्ट्रभक्ति और आत्मरक्षा ही सिखाया जाता है। इसके बाद विषयों की पढ़ाई होती है। 18 वर्ष का होते-होते हर बच्चा परिवार से अलग रहने लगता है और विविध तरीकों से धनार्जन करने लगता है। नशा और अलग-अलग पार्टनरों के साथ रहना भी यहां आम है। इस तरह एकांकी और उच्छृंखल जीवन के 10-12 वर्ष बिताने के बाद जीवन में स्थिरता की तलाश शुरू होती है और इन्हें भारतीय ज्ञान में ही ठौर दिखता है।\n\nजीवनसाथी के रूप में भारतीय पुरुष पहली पसंद\n\nजीवनसाथी के रूप में रशियन महिलाओं की पहली पसंद भारतीय पुरुष बने हुए हैं। प्रो. विनय पांडेय बताते हैं कि रूस में पढ़ने या नौकरी के लिए जाने वाले भारतीय युवाओं के साथ वहां की महिलाएं वैवाहिक बंधन में बंध रही हैं। प्रो. पांडेय का मानना है कि इसके पीछे भी भारतीय संस्कृति ही आधार है। रूस में पांच साल से ज्यादा चलने वाले विवाह संबंध को सफल का दर्जा दिया जाता है जबकि भारत में बहुविवाह या अलगाव अब भी ज्यादा प्रचलन में नहीं है। यहां के लोग विवाह को जीवनपर्यंत का साथ मानते हैं।\n\nसुखद है भारतीय ज्ञान और ज्योतिष का प्रसार\n\nरूस जैसे देश में भारतीय ज्ञान और ज्योतिष के प्रसार को प्रो. विनय पांडेय सुखद मानते हैं। उन्होंने बताया कि अमेरिका सहित यूरोपीय देशों में भारतीय ज्ञान के प्रति रुझान दशकों से है मगर रूस और आसपास के देशों में इनका प्रसार कम ही रहा है। हालांकि बीते वर्षों में भारतीय छात्रों के इस क्षेत्र में पढ़ने और काम के सिलसिले में जाने से भी इसका प्रसार बढ़ा है। खासतौर पर योग को लेकर यहां गजब का क्रेज है। मॉस्को में ही कई योग स्कूल भी खुले हैं।",

        "summary": "The article highlights the growing influence of Indian culture, particularly astrology, among Russian youth. Over 60% of young Russians trust \"Kundli remedies\" for solving their problems. Professor Vinay Pandey from BHU's Sanskrit Vidya Dharma Vigyan faculty recently returned from Moscow, where he observed this trend during an international workshop on astrology. Russian youth are increasingly interested in astrological solutions, including mantras and rituals for peace and problem-solving. The lifestyle in Russia, characterized by early independence and a search for stability after a decade of a solitary and unrestrained life, is seen as a reason for this interest. Additionally, Russian women prefer Indian men as life partners, attributing this to the stability and lifelong commitment associated with Indian culture. The spread of Indian knowledge and astrology in Russia is seen as a positive development, with a notable interest in yoga as well."

Gandhi claimed that the BJP and RSS have taken over educational institutions, leading to ongoing problems. He sarcastically remarked that while PM Modi can intervene in international conflicts, he seems unable or unwilling to stop paper leaks. The INDIA alliance, according to Gandhi, will ensure such issues are addressed."

        "body": "नयी दिल्ली, 20 जून (भाषा) मेडिकल प्रवेश परीक्षा (नीट) में कथित अनियमितताओं के खिलाफ बृहस्पतिवार को विरोध प्रदर्शन और तेज हो गया। कई छात्र समूहों ने विरोध प्रदर्शन किया और विपक्ष ने सरकार पर हमला करते हुए कहा कि पेपर लीक होना व्यापमं घोटाले का विस्तार है और इन परीक्षाओं में बैठने वाले उम्मीदवारों का भविष्य बर्बाद हो रहा है।\n\nनीट पर बढ़ते विवाद के बीच यूजीसी-नेट को रद्द करने से राष्ट्रीय परीक्षा एजेंसी (एनटीए) की बड़े पैमाने पर इम्तिहान आयोजित करने की क्षमता पर सवाल उठने लगे हैं।\n\nशिक्षा मंत्रालय ने कहा कि वह पटना में नीट परीक्षा के आयोजन में कथित अनियमितताओं पर बिहार पुलिस की आर्थिक अपराध इकाई की रिपोर्ट का इंतजार कर रहा है और उसके आधार पर आगे की कार्रवाई करेगा।\n\nमंत्रालय ने इस मुद्दे पर आगे चर्चा करने के लिए एनटीए के महानिदेशक सुबोध कुमार सिंह को भी तलब किया।\n\nकेंद्रीय शिक्षा मंत्रालय ने परीक्षा की शुचिता से समझौता होने की सूचना मिलने के बाद बुधवार देर रात विश्वविद्यालय अनुदान आयोग (यूजीसी) की राष्ट्रीय पात्रता परीक्षा (नेट) को रद्द करने का आदेश दिया।\n\nकांग्रेस नेता राहुल गांधी ने प्रेस वार्ता कर नीट में कथित अनियमितताओं और यूजीसी-नेट रद्द करने को लेकर सरकार पर तीखा हमला बोला और दावा किया कि प्रधानमंत्री नरेन्द्र मोदी मनोवैज्ञानिक रूप से टूट चुके हैं और सरकार चलाने के लिए संघर्ष करेंगे।\n\nकांग्रेस के पूर्व अध्यक्ष ने दावा किया कि शिक्षण संस्थाओं पर भारतीय जनता पार्टी (भाजपा) और उसके मातृत्व संगठन राष्ट्रीय स्वयंसेवक संघ (आरएसएस) से जुड़े लोगों ने कब्जा कर लिया है। उन्होंने कहा कि जब तक इस स्थिति को बदला नहीं जाएगा तब तक पेपर लीक होना बंद नहीं होंगे।\n\nउन्होंने कटाक्ष करते हुए यह भी कहा कि प्रधानमंत्री मोदी रूस-यूक्रेन, इज़राइल-गाज़ा युद्ध रोक देते हैं, लेकिन पेपर लीक को रोक नहीं पा रहे या फिर इसे रोकना नहीं चाहते हैं।\n\nगांधी ने दावा किया कि भारत जोड़ो न्याय यात्रा के दौरान हजारों लोगों ने पेपर लीक की शिकायत की थी।\n\nउन्होंने आरोप लगाया कि मध्यप्रदेश में हुए 'व्यापमं' घोटाले को पूरे देश में फैलाने की कोशिश की जा रही है।\n\nगांधी ने कहा, 'कोई भी काम मनमाने तरीके से नहीं किया जाना चाहिए, जो नियम एक पेपर पर लागू होते हैं, वही दूसरे पर भी लागू होने चाहिए।'\n\nयूजीसी-नेट परीक्षा रद्द करने और राष्ट्रीय पात्रता सह प्रवेश परीक्षा-स्नातक (नीट-यूजी) में अनियमितताओं के खिलाफ प्रदर्शन कर रहे विभिन्न विश्वविद्यालयों के दो दर्जन से अधिक विद्यार्थियों और विभिन्न छात्र संगठनों के सदस्यों को हिरासत में लिया गया।\n\nछात्रों को शिक्षा मंत्रालय और शिक्षा मंत्री धर्मेंद्र प्रधान के यहां स्थित आवास के बाहर से हिरासत में लिया गया।\n\nबिहार के उपमुख्यमंत्री विजय कुमार सिन्हा ने दावा किया कि नीट 'पेपर लीक' मामले में गिरफ्तार मुख्य आरोपी का संबंध राष्ट्रीय जनता दल (राजद) के नेता तेजस्वी यादव से जुड़े अधिकारियों से है और उन्होंने इसकी जांच की मांग की।\n\nकेरल के मुख्यमंत्री पी. विजयन ने केंद्र से एनटीए में संकट को हल करने के लिए तत्काल कदम उठाने का आग्रह करते हुए कहा कि नीट और यूजीसी-नेट जैसी परीक्षाएं आयोजित करने में एजेंसी की 'बार-बार की अक्षमता' स्वीकार्य नहीं है।\n\nतृणमूल कांग्रेस के सांसद साकेत गोखले ने कहा कि देश में परीक्षा प्रक्रिया चरमरा गई है और छात्रों का जीवन बर्बाद हो रहा है। उन्होंने एनटीए पर इसमें मिलीभगत का आरोप लगाया।\n\nराष्ट्रीय जनता दल (राजद) के सांसद मनोज झा ने कहा कि नीट परीक्षा भी रद्द कर दी जानी चाहिए।\n\nवहीं भारतीय कम्युनिस्ट पार्टी (मार्क्सवादी) के महासचिव सीताराम येचुरी ने एनटीए को खत्म करने और केंद्रीय शिक्षा मंत्री के इस्तीफे की मांग की।\n\nयेचुरी ने 'एक्स' पर पोस्ट में कहा, 'हम अपने छात्रों - भारत के भविष्य - के साथ एकजुटता रखते हैं, जो (नरेन्द्र) मोदी के नेतृत्व वाली 'एनडी गठबंधन' (राजग) सरकार द्वारा अपने शैक्षणिक मानकों को नष्ट होने से बचाने के लिए संघर्ष कर रहे हैं।'\n\nउन्होंने यह भी कहा कि हाल में नेट और नीट परीक्षा देने वाले छात्रों को केंद्र सरकार द्वारा मुआवजा दिया जाना चाहिए और पीएचडी प्रवेश के लिए अनिवार्य नेट अंक की हाल में अपनाई गई प्रणाली को वापस लिया जाना चाहिए।\n\nभारतीय कम्युनिस्ट पार्टी (भाकपा) के महासचिव डी राजा ने भी एनटीए को खत्म करने की मांग की।\n\nराजा ने कहा, 'उन्होंने संघीय व्यवस्था विरोधी, गरीब विरोधी नीट लागू किया और हमारे देश की चिकित्सा शिक्षा प्रणाली को खतरे में डाल दिया, जिससे वंचित वर्ग गुणवत्तापूर्ण चिकित्सा शिक्षा से वंचित हो गया। पेपर लीक होने के कारण यूजीसी-नेट को रद्द करने से परीक्षा आयोजित करने में एनटीए की अक्षमता फिर से उजागर हो गई।'",

NTA को लेकर नरमी और तरफदारी कहीं मोदी सरकार को भारी न पड़ जाए?\n\nNEET एग्जाम को लेकर केंद्र सरकार का शुरुआती रवैया काफी ढीला ढाला रहा. यूट्यूबर ध्रुव राठी ने एक वीडियो में शिक्षा मंत्री धर्मेंद्र प्रधान को मोदी सरकार का PR मंत्री बताया है, और उनके सोशल मीडिया X हैंडल का हवाला देते हुए दलील दी है कि वो NEET की कौन कहे, शिक्षा क्षेत्र से जुड़ी भी कोई पोस्ट देखने को नहीं मिली है.\n\nपेपर लीक के विरोध में कांग्रेस के छात्र संगठन NSUI के कार्यकर्ताओं ने भी शिक्षा मंत्री धर्मेंद्र प्रधान के घर के बाहर प्रदर्शन किया - और विरोध प्रकट करने के लिए 500 रुपये के नकली नोट हवा में उछाले.\n\nNSUI ने आरोप लगाया कि इस घोटाले में पैसे लिये गये हैं, और हम ये पैसा खुलेआर्म देने के लिए तैयार हैं. पुलिस ने कार्यकर्ताओं को हिरासत में लेकर प्रदर्शन खत्म कराया. NSUI ने नेशनल टेस्टिंग एजेंसी एनटीए पर पाबंदी लगाने और इस मामले में शामिल अधिकारियों के खिलाफ कार्रवाई की मांग की.\n\nहालांकि, बाद में शिक्षा मंत्री धर्मेंद्र प्रधान ने NEETUG पेपर लीक मामले में गड़बड़ी की बात मान ली. 16 जून को धर्मेंद्र प्रधान ने कहा कि NEET के नतीजों में कुछ गड़बड़ियां हुई हैं... और जो भी बड़े अधिकारी इसमें शामिल पाये जाएंगे, उनको बख्शा नहीं जाएगा.\n\nधर्मेंद्र प्रधान ने, साथ ही, ये भी माना कि NEET परीक्षा लेने वाली नेशनल टेस्टिंग एजेंसी यानी NTA में सुधार की जरूरत है.\n\n2. पेपर लीक मामले में क्या बाकी सरकारों के बराबर आ गई है मोदी सरकार?\n\nपेपर लीक के मामले ऐसे होते जा रहे हैं कि हर सरकार हम्माम में नजर आती है. पेपर लीक के मामले राजस्थान से अशोक गहलोत सरकार के दौरान भी आते रहे हैं, और बढ़ चढ़ कर दावे करने वाली उत्तर प्रदेश की योगी आदित्यनाथ सरकार भी पेपर लीक रोक पाने में नाकाम नजर आई है.\n\nऔर सिर्फ राज्य सरकारों की कौन कहे, NEET पेपर लीक का मामला तो केंद्र सरकार से जुड़ा है, और मुश्किल ये है कि केंद्र सरकार भी इसे नहीं रोक पा रही है - पेपर लीक का मुद्दा इतना गंभीर हो चुका है कि लोकसभा चुनाव के दौरान भी ये छाया रहा.\n\nकांग्रेस ने अपने मेनिफेस्टो में कहा, सत्ता में आने पर पेपर लीक होने के मामलों का निपटारा करने के लिए फास्ट-ट्रैक अदालतों का गठन किया जाएगा और पीड़ितों को आर्थिक मुआवजा दिया जाएगा. बीजेपी ने भी अपने संकल्प पत्र में कहा था, पेपर लीक नियंत्रण के लिए कानून लागू करेंगे... सरकारी भर्ती परीक्षाओं में अनियमितता को रोकने के लिए सख्य कानून बनाया है... अब कानून को सख्ती से लागू करके युवाओं के भविष्य से खिलवाड़ करने वालों को कड़ी सजा दी जाएगी.\n\n3. पेपर लीक कांड को बिहार ने बना दिया है मुद्दा?\n\nनीट पेपर लीक मामले में बिहार पुलिस की आर्थिक अपराध इकाई ने अब तक 13 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया है, जिनमें इम्तिहान में शामिल कुछ छात्र भी शामिल हैं. अब तक की जांच में सिकंदर प्रसाद यादवेंदु को इस केस का मास्टरमाइंड माना जा रहा है. सिकंदर यादवेंदु बिहार के दानापुर नगर परिषद में जूनियर इंजीनियर है. पकड़े गए सात छात्रों ने पूछताछ के दौरान बताया है कि कैसे सिकंदर यादवेंदु ने पेपर लीक किया है.\n\nबिहार के डिप्टी सीएम विजय सिन्हा ने इस मामले में अपने पूर्ववर्ती तेजस्वी यादव को भी लपेट लिया है. पेपर लीक में शामिल एक गिरोह के सदस्यों के पटना के एक सरकारी गेस्ट हाउस में ठहरने की खबरों के बीच विजय सिन्हा कह रहे हैं, मैं जानकारी जुटा रहा हूं... एनएचएआई गेस्ट हाउस से जो लोग पकड़े गए हैं, उनका संबंध प्रीतम नाम के एक व्यक्ति से है... लोग कहते हैं कि उसका संबंध पूर्व डिप्टी सीएम तेजस्वी यादव से है... हम पूरे मामले की जानकारी जुटा रहे हैं.\n\nविजय सिन्हा के आरोपों पर आरजेडी की तरफ सवाल उठाये गये हैं. आजेडी का कहना है कि पहले ये साफ किया जाना चाहिये यदुवंशी को 2012 में जूनियर इंजीनियर की नौकरी कैसे मिली? और 2021 में दानापुर में पोस्टिंग के साथ उसे टाउन प्लानिंग विभाग में कैसे ट्रांसफर कर दिया गया?\n\nRJD ने अपने X हैंडल पर लिखा है, 'NEET परीक्षा का प्रश्न पत्र एक दिन पहले ही उनके अभिभावकों और दलालों के मार्फत परीक्षार्थियों को उपलब्ध करा दिया था... बिहार पुलिस के समक्ष पकड़े गए परीक्षार्थी भी स्वीकार कर रहे है कि परीक्षा के एक दिन पहले प्रश्न पत्र उन्हें दिए गए एवं लीक माफिया द्वारा उन्हें सभी उत्तर भी रटा दिए गए थे... और वही Question Paper एवं सभी सवाल परीक्षा में भी आए थे, लेकिन अभी भी #NTA पेपर लीक से इंकार कर रही है.'\n\nआरजेडी ने मोदी सरकार पर छात्रों के भविष्य के साथ खिलवाड़ का आरोप लगाया है, हरियाणा और गुजरात में भी यही हुआ... हरियाणा में तो बीजेपी नेता से संबंधित एक ही परीक्षा केंद्र से 6 परीक्षार्थियों ने टॉप किया... सबूत होने के बावजूद मोदी सरकार 30 लाख छात्रों के भविष्य के साथ खिलवाड़ कर रही है.\n\n4. राहुल गांधी कहां तक ले जाएंगे छात्रों की लड़ाई को?\n\nलोकसभा चुनाव के नतीजों से उत्साहित राहुल गांधी ने शेयर मार्केट में घोटाले के आरोप के बाद NEET एग्जाम को लेकर प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी पर जोरदार हमला बोला है. राहुल गांधी ने मोदी सरकार पर युवाओं के लिए रोजी-रोटी के विकल्प खत्म कर देने जैसा गंभीर इल्जाम लगाया है - और इसे आगे बढ़ कर वो इसे सरकार की अग्निवीर योजना से जोड़ दिया है.\n\nचुनाव के दौरान विपक्ष ने संविधान खत्म करने जैसे आरोप लगाये थे, और अब शिक्षा के क्षेत्र में संघ की विचारधारा के लोगों के उच्च पदों पर बैठे होना वजह बता रहे हैं. राहुल गांधी कहते हैं, 'सभी शिक्षण संस्थानों को बीजेपी के लोगों ने कैप्चर कर रखा है... जब तक इन्हें मुक्त नहीं कराया जाएगा, तब तक ये चलता रहेगा.'\n\nNET परीक्षा को रद्द किये जाने का हवाला देते हुए राहुल गांधी ने प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस में कहा, प्रधानमंत्री मोदी इस लीक को रोक नहीं पाए... एक परीक्षा में गड़बड़ियों के बाद आप रद्द कर चुके हैं, पता नहीं दूसरे को रद्द किया जाएगा या नहीं, लेकिन कोई न कोई तो इसके लिए जिम्मेदार है... और इसके लिए किसी न किसी को तो पकड़ा जाना चाहिये. कांग्रेस की प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस में राहुल गांधी ने कहा कि शिक्षा व्यवस्था का डिमॉनेटाइजेशन हो गया है.\n\nकांग्रेस नेता कटाक्ष किया, कहा जा रहा है नरेंद्र मोदी जी ने रूस यूक्रेन की लड़ाई रुकवा दी थी... इसराइल और गाजा के बीच में चल रही लड़ाई मोदी जी ने रुकवा दिया था, लेकिन किसी न किसी कारण हिंदुस्तान में पेपर लीक हो रहे हैं उसको नरेंद्र मोदी रोक नहीं पा रहे हैं या रोकना नहीं चाहते हैं?\n\nसंसद में सरकार को घेरने का राहुल गांधी को अच्छा मौका मिल गया है. मान कर चलना चाहिये इस मुद्दे पर राहुल गांधी को पूरे विपक्ष का साथ मिलेगा. शेयर बाजार के मामले में वो जेपीसी से जांच कराने की मांग कर चुके हैं. मुश्किल ये है कि जेपीसी जांच के नाम पर राहुल गांधी को पूरे विपक्ष का साथ नहीं मिलता है. अडानी के मामले में ममता बनर्जी की पार्टी टीएमसी तैयार नहीं हुई थी.\n\nअब अगर NEET पेपर लीक के मामले को वो व्यापम जैसा बता रहे हैं, तो जाहिर है इस मामले में भी जेपीसी जैसी जांच की मांग कर सकते हैं.\n\n5. मोदी सरकार के पास क्या रास्ते बचे हैं?\n\nकेंद्र सरकार ने UGC-NET तो रद्द कर दिया है, NEET के मामले की जांच के लिए एक स्पेशल पैनल बनाया गया है - वैसे भी ये मामला ऐसा विकराल रूप ले चुका है कि मोदी सरकार के पास निजात पाने के बहुत कम विकल्प बचे लगते हैं.\n\n1. सूत्रों के हवाले से आई कुछ मीडिया रिपोर्ट से पता चलता है कि NEET एग्जाम से सरकार की साख पर आई आंच से बचने के लिए शिक्षा मंत्रालय तमाम विकल्पों पर विचार कर रहा है - और इसी क्रम में NEET परीक्षा फिर से कराये जाने पर भी विचार किया जा रहा है. हालांकि, ये मामला अभी किसी नतीजे तक नहीं पहुंच सका है.\n\n2. हो सकता है सुप्रीम कोर्ट में 8 जुलाई को NEET केस की सुनवाई के बाद NTA के महानिदेशक सहित आला अधिकारियों के खिलाफ एक्शन लेकर रस्म अदायगी कर दी जाये.\n\nप्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी छात्रों को टेंशन में न आने देने के लिए बोर्ड एग्जाम से पहले 'परीक्षा पे चर्चा' जैसे कार्यक्रमों के जरिये खुद बातचीत करते हैं, लेकिन NTA परीक्षाओं की वजह से टेंशन में आए छात्रों को दिलासा शिक्षा मंत्री धर्मेंद्र प्रधान दे रहे हैं, लेकिन वे कह इतना ही रहे हैं कि बिहार से आई सूचना पर एक उच्च स्तरीय जांच समिति इस मामले की जांच करेगी. और मामले की तह तक जाएगी और जो दोषी होगा उस पर कड़ी कार्रवाई की जाएगी. लेकिन क्या छात्रों के लिए इतना काफी है?",

The central government has offered affected students the option to retake the exam or proceed without grace marks.\n\n3. **Legal and Investigative Actions**: Multiple petitions have been filed in various High Courts, and the Supreme Court is set to hear the combined cases on July 8. The government has formed a special panel to investigate, and Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has acknowledged the need for reforms in the NTA.\n\n4. **Political Implications**: The issue has provided Rahul Gandhi and the opposition with ammunition to criticize the Modi government, linking it to broader concerns about corruption and mismanagement in educational institutions.\n\n5. **Government's Response**: The government has canceled the UGC-NET exam and is considering re-conducting the NEET exam. The Supreme Court's upcoming decision may lead to further actions against NTA officials.\n\nThe controversy highlights systemic issues in exam administration and has significant political and educational implications."

        "summary": "In a recent press conference, former Congress President Rahul Gandhi criticized the central government over alleged paper leaks in UGC-NET and NEET-UG exams. He mocked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, claiming that while Modi boasts of stopping the Russia-Ukraine war, he cannot or does not want to stop paper leaks in India. Gandhi asserted that Modi is psychologically broken and more concerned with retaining power than addressing educational issues. He accused the BJP and its affiliates of controlling educational institutions, leading to these leaks. Gandhi also mentioned that the opposition will raise this issue in the upcoming parliamentary session. Following the controversy, the Education Ministry has ordered the cancellation of the UGC-NET exam and handed the investigation over to the CBI."

        "body": "俄罗斯总统普京与中国国家领导人习近平本周三借上合组织峰会再度会面。短短两月内，两位领导人再度会面，能否就结束俄乌危机达成一定共识？而中国意图借上合组织推广其影响力的目的能达成吗？\n\n中共党媒新华社最新报道，在上合组织峰会召开之际，俄罗斯总统普京（Vladimir Putin）与中国国家领导人习近平本周三（7月3日）再度会面。\n\n美联社指，此次会面是普京今年五月访问北京以来中俄领导人的再次聚首，这次见面显示两人在同样面对与西方地缘政治关系持续紧张之际，再次展示牢固的\"战略伙伴关系\"。\n\n新加坡国立大学政治系副教授庄嘉颖认为，中国与俄罗斯、尤其是俄罗斯通过参加峰会展现并没有被国际社会完全孤立，但中俄借此舞台扩大其影响力的效果有限。他说，成员国在经贸合作上可能会达成一些实质性协议，即便如此，也无法为中俄两国国内经济复苏提供新的增长点。\n\n他说：\"对中国来说，在经贸和能源进口这些方面会有一定保障，能让它的经济比较稳定，可是稳定不代表增长。至于说俄罗斯，经过中亚国家，它的能源可以往其他国家，包括中国等外销，也会有一定的经济保障效果。\"\n\n美国智库威尔逊中心基辛格中美研究所主任戴博（Robert Daly）在接受本台采访时表示：\"显然，中国希望利用上合组织、金砖国家、'一带一路'、三大发展倡议和其他各种区域论坛来加强其作为'全球南方领导者'的地位。换句话说，中国希望被视为提供一整套替代二战后建立的制度、规范和价值观的解决方案。\"\n\n不过，在俄乌战争进入关键阶段之际，中俄关系的紧密正受到包括北大西洋公约组织(NATO)和日本、澳大利亚等亚洲国家的关注。\n\n彭博社报道另指，芬兰总统斯图布（Alexander Stubb）日前在接受采访时表示，俄罗斯的依赖让中国获得了更强实力，中国只需一通电话就能结束俄罗斯在乌克兰发动的战争。\n\n美国国务卿布林肯（Antony Blinken）本周一在华盛顿智库布鲁金斯学会的研讨会上也指出，随着中国与俄罗斯带来的安全风险加剧，中国对俄罗斯持续提供援助，在俄罗斯发展为欧洲面临的最大安全威胁之一中，中国扮演了推波助澜的角色。因此美国政策需要打破欧洲、亚洲联盟之间的隔阂。\n\n\"我认为中国的目标非常明确。随着时间的推移，在未来几十年里，他们希望成为国际体系中军事、经济和外交的领先主导国，这是显而易见的。\"布林肯指出：\"如果他们对世界的愿景与我们或其他许多国家相符，那将是一回事，但他们对未来有不同的看法。因此，我们将非常激烈地竞争，以确保我们能够有效塑造未来。\"\n\n但是，普京和习近平此次会面能否就结束俄乌危机达成一定共识？戴博分析认为，中俄达成实质性共识的概率极低。\n\n\"他们也许能够推出一份文件，写着'尊重各国合法安全关切'、'霸权不好'等含糊、毫无意义的话，俄罗斯会声称这是中国支持的表现，但那又能怎么样？\"他说：\"就连中国也不想完全参与俄罗斯的残酷侵略，中亚国家和印度也不会支持俄罗斯的行动，即便他们不会直接批评俄罗斯的入侵行为。\"\n\n上合组织作为一个政治和安全组织，由中国和俄罗斯于2001年发起，成员国包括哈萨克斯坦等中亚五国，及印度、伊朗、巴基斯坦。本次峰会预计重点讨论经济、能源、反恐问题，同时涉及俄乌战争和其他地缘政治问题。\n\n戴博分析指出，由于\"全球南方\"内部存在分歧，这一团体是否需要被领导、是否像中俄一样反对发达民主国家、中国能否提出一个完美的替代方案等问题犹在，因此他认为，中国很难通过上合组织等区域论坛来制衡西方在国际舞台的影响力。",

        "summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping met again at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, marking their second meeting in two months. This meeting underscores their strategic partnership amid ongoing geopolitical tensions with the West. Experts suggest that while the summit may yield some economic agreements, it is unlikely to significantly boost the domestic economies of China and Russia. The summit also highlights China's efforts to expand its influence through regional forums like the SCO, BRICS, and the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nThe meeting comes at a critical juncture in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, drawing attention from NATO and countries like Japan and Australia. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the security risks posed by the China-Russia alliance and the need for the U.S. to strengthen its alliances in Europe and Asia. Despite the high-profile meeting, experts believe it is improbable that China and Russia will reach a substantial consensus on ending the Russia-Ukraine crisis.\n\nThe SCO, founded by China and Russia in 2001, includes Central Asian countries, India, Iran, and Pakistan. The summit's agenda covers economic, energy, and anti-terrorism issues, along with the Russia-Ukraine war and other geopolitical concerns. However, internal divisions within the \"Global South\" and differing views on opposing developed democratic nations suggest that China's ability to counter Western influence through the SCO remains limited."

        "body": "俄朝刚签完军事互助协议，想不到朝鲜这么快就开始出兵了。有媒体爆料称，在朝鲜最高领导人金正恩的授权下，朝鲜4个工兵旅共计2万人的队伍，将于近日抵达东乌地区。他们此行的目的并不是直接参与到俄乌战争中，而是为了帮助俄罗斯加强在东乌地区的军事工事。不过此举遭到了美韩的强烈反对，泽连斯基也一时间慌了神。因为朝鲜此举虽然并未直接参战，但已经等同于间接这么做的。毕竟朝鲜的工兵抵达后，俄罗斯就可以从修筑工事的队伍中抽调更多的兵力，投入到对乌的前线战场。\n\n这让泽连斯基当然难以承受，美韩之所以坐不住，很显然他们是在担心，经此一事后，如果未来朝鲜遇到麻烦的话，俄罗斯大概率会出手帮助解决。那么军事同盟关系正式生效，这对美韩来说，当然是个坏消息。然而现在最紧张的当属乌克兰总统泽连斯基，如果他准备在前线放手一搏，能扭转局势吗？有媒体爆料称，泽连斯基终于扛不住压力向中国求援了，乌克兰计划在7月份从扎波罗热和顿涅茨克地区发动大规模反攻。虽然乌克兰现在背后有超过20个北约国家的资源，但几次较量的结果却让泽连斯基无法接受，因为不但没有优势，反而还出现了劣势。\n\n现在朝鲜也开始介入，那就更加不利于乌克兰扭转战局了。这样的局面下，泽连斯基选择把目光转向中国，希望中方能出手帮助化解这次危机。泽连斯基在求助中国的时候，似乎忘了他在香格里拉对话会上，对中国那充满敌意的态度了。竟公然批评中国干扰\"瑞士和平峰会\"，现在有麻烦了，又想到中国了。其实在这次中国没有参加的\"瑞士和平峰会\"上，世界所有国家再一次见识到了中国在全球的影响力。因为在中方宣布不参加峰会后，十多个国家先后都表态也不参加了。包括南非、印度、巴西等国也都没有在联合公报上签字，而这些国家要么是金砖成员国，要么就是中国\"一带一路\"的合作伙伴，中国的影响力高下立见。\n\n另一方面，泽连斯基也担心，一旦跟中国闹僵，害怕真的会将中方推向俄罗斯那边，那可就得不偿失了。但不得不说，泽连斯基的担忧有点多余了，中方早已明确立场，在俄乌冲突中保持中立，不站队任何一方，中方也一直在推动俄乌双方通过政治解决问题，是乌克兰一味地对美西方听之任之，才导致这场冲突持续到现在。当务之急，乌方应当端正自己的态度，认清俄罗斯在前线占据优势的事实，尽快坐到谈判桌前，在中国等中立国家的推动下，达成符合双方利益的和平方案，避免造成更多伤亡。",

        "summary": "A new conflict is brewing as North Korea prepares to send troops to Ukraine. Following a recent military assistance agreement with Russia, North Korea, under Kim Jong-un's authorization, is dispatching 20,000 soldiers to Eastern Ukraine. Their mission is to bolster Russian military fortifications, indirectly aiding Russia in the conflict. This move has drawn strong opposition from the U.S. and South Korea, and has alarmed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who fears it will further disadvantage Ukraine.\n\nIn response, Zelensky has urgently sought help from China, despite previously criticizing China at the Shangri-La Dialogue. Ukraine plans a major counteroffensive in July, but past engagements have not been favorable. Zelensky's appeal to China highlights the significant global influence China wields, as evidenced by multiple countries' decisions to skip the Swiss Peace Summit after China declined to participate.\n\nZelensky is also concerned about pushing China closer to Russia, but China's stance remains neutral, advocating for a political resolution to the conflict. The article suggests that Ukraine should adopt a more realistic approach, acknowledge Russia's frontline advantage, and engage in negotiations facilitated by neutral countries like China to achieve a peaceful resolution and prevent further casualties."

        "title": "俄军打出一个下马威，一次摧毁5架苏-27！F-16的神话会破灭吗？_手机网易网",
        "body": "一次性摧毁乌军5架苏-27，俄军给F-16打了一个下马威。根据俄国防部发布战报称，俄军发射\"伊斯坎德尔\"战术导弹，对乌东地区的米尔哥罗德机场，实施了集群式攻击。\"伊斯坎德尔\"导弹特别换装了集束弹头，穿透乌军防空网，击中5架苏-27战斗机。其中，2架被彻底摧毁，3架受损。有网友就纳闷了，打了2年多了，怎么乌军还有这么多苏-27？俄军能否击落F-16？今天，一林就跟大家聊一聊，F-16对决苏俄战机的不败金身，会不会被打破？\n\n苏联解体以后，乌克兰继承了大约77架苏-27战斗机。但因为乌克兰经济崩溃，军队腐败，到俄乌战前，能飞起来的苏-27，就只剩32架了。可神奇的是，就这么32架，俄乌战争打了2年多，居然没有被全部摧毁，这是怎么回事？其实，乌军拥有的苏-27所剩无几了，也就剩个10多架了，大部分都被击落了。这一次，被一次性摧毁5架，对乌克兰空军而言，是一个重大的噩耗。\n\n乌军之所以还能保留10多架苏-27，不是因为乌空军有多强大，而是长期采取龟缩战术。比如，俄军一天出动飞机30架次，乌军一天就只能出动一到两个架次。大部分时候，乌军的苏-27、米格-29、苏-24等战机，都是龟缩起来的，出勤率低，损失数量也就比较少了。毕竟，这是乌空军全部的家底了，打完就没了。\n\n俄军此次空袭选择的时机，也十分地微妙。因为F-16在乌东战场上，刚刚完成了首次攻击。但这次攻击，是一次试探性地攻击，并没有对俄军造成重大损失。可它意味着，从这一刻开始，F-16真真切切地被投入乌东战场了。俄军选择此时袭击乌军机场，就是要给F-16来一个下马威。考虑到俄空天军和防空系统的拉胯，很多人质疑，俄军可能无法击落F-16。这种质疑是完全没有必要的。\n\n俄乌战争，是冷战后，双方技术差距最小的一次大规模战争。只要F-16进入乌东，被击落就是迟早的事。任何武器都会有战损，关键在于，它能否得到及时地补充。早在2018年，胡塞武装就使用老旧的R-27空空导弹，从地面发射，精准击落了沙特两架F-15战斗机。沙特的F-15是土豪定制版，性能比美军自用的版本还要先进，而乌军的F-16是早期猴版。在没有技术代差的情况下，F-16想在乌东战场上，实现零损失，几乎是不可能的。\n\n而且，乌军接收的第一批F-16，数量太少了，只有4到6架。靠4到6架F-16，去争夺制空权，是不可能的。它的主要功能是发射AIM-120远程空空导弹，逼退俄军的苏-34战斗轰炸机。\n\n从5架苏-27被摧毁来看，乌军是没有能力保护好机场的。为了避免F-16刚参战，就被摧毁，乌克兰已经申请将F-16部署在邻国机场，包括波兰、捷克、斯洛伐克等。\n\n尽管俄军的S-300、S-400，实战表现不如预期，但过度神话F-16，只会让它更快地跌落神坛。",

        "summary": "In a recent military action, Russian forces destroyed five Ukrainian Su-27 fighter jets using \"Iskander\" tactical missiles at the Mirgorod airport in eastern Ukraine. This attack, which resulted in the complete destruction of two jets and damage to three others, is seen as a significant blow to the Ukrainian Air Force. The timing of the strike coincides with the recent deployment of F-16 fighter jets by Ukraine, marking their first use in the conflict. The Russian attack is perceived as a warning to the capabilities of the F-16s.\n\nHistorically, Ukraine inherited around 77 Su-27s after the Soviet Union's dissolution, but due to economic and military challenges, only about 32 were operational before the war. Over two years of conflict have reduced this number significantly, with only about a dozen remaining before this latest attack.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force has been using a strategy of limited engagement to preserve its remaining aircraft, contrasting with the more frequent sorties by Russian forces. The recent introduction of F-16s, although in limited numbers (4-6 jets), is unlikely to shift the balance of air superiority. The F-16s are primarily intended to launch AIM-120 long-range air-to-air missiles to deter Russian aircraft.\n\nGiven the current situation, Ukraine has requested to station its F-16s in neighboring countries like Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia to protect them from immediate destruction. The article suggests that while the F-16s are advanced, they are not invincible, and their mythologized status may lead to unrealistic expectations."

Stubb emphasized that if Xi were to suggest peace talks, Russia would have no choice but to comply.

Despite this, China maintains a stance of neutrality in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the current Sino-Russian relationship as the best in history, highlighting its importance for global stability. The comments were made ahead of a meeting between Putin and Xi at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Astana, Kazakhstan.

        "body": "其实放眼整个世界，在经济上，中国对于欧洲的重要性，要比欧洲对于中国的重要性要高。但是即便如此，欧盟还是和老美沆瀣一气，粗暴地对我们的电动汽车加征关税。\n\n详情请点击下面视频观看\n\n而且眼看着7月4日的期限即将临近，欧盟似乎也没有要回头的意思，毫无疑问，这会影响中欧之间的关系。\n\n欧盟的紧逼，应该要想到中国不会忍气吞声，必然会有所反击，而这也引发了不少人的担忧，因为有些人认为，中欧之间可能会因此而打起贸易战，当然这对双方而言都会带来不好的结果。\n\n对此，希腊前财政部长瓦鲁法基斯站了出来，替我们说了句公道话，表示让欧洲不要忘记了，16年前，如果不是中国伸出援手，或许在08年的全球金融危机中，欧洲也不可能如此快走出困境。\n\n那时候的中国，对于国内投资和对外贸易都作出了调整，虽然本质上是了促进本国的经济发展，但在这个过程中，中国也在一定程度上帮助了欧洲经济的复苏，比如说，当时的中国就进口非常多的德国产品，让许多本来已经濒临倒闭的德国企业\"起死回生\"。\n\n不仅如此，欧债危机时，中国也是\"出了一份力\"，不少的欧洲债券被中国买了去，可不能小瞧了这一步动作，这可是有助于让欧洲经济从低迷往上走的，从现在欧洲还流传着类似欧洲走出金融危机多得中国，就可以知晓，中国对欧洲而言，在当时的金融危机，是正面的形象，可以算得上是个大\"恩人\"。\n\n因此，欧盟针对中国的电动汽车，显然是非常粗暴，并且不合理的。\n\n而且瓦鲁法基斯还指出，欧盟不是一直在叫嚷着要绿色转型，但其实在这方面中国也是可以帮大忙的。\n\n过去欧洲想要进行绿色转型，但是在俄乌战争爆发后，由于对俄罗斯的经济制裁，让这个项目推进得十分艰难，甚至还有些倒退的意思，从不少国家再次让火力发电厂开始工作就知道了。\n\n不过尽管没了俄罗斯，但是我们还能和中国做贸易，毕竟在这方面，中国可是个强手，就说欧洲想要发展太阳能领域方面的吧，中国可以产出许多占据优势的关键部件，像这多晶硅以及晶圆等，不仅是质量上乘，而且价格也适中。\n\n还有这些年来，中国就和欧洲国家展开了合作，在绿色能源方面也取得了不错的成绩，比如和多个国家建设风电站等，都在一定程度让这些国家实现了节能减排。\n\n再说现在中国的新能源汽车本来就领先，而且性价还高，如果欧盟此时加征关税，毫无疑问，这会影响中国电动汽车在欧洲的销售，而欧洲本土的电动汽车又跟不上，而这也会冲击欧洲想要绿色转型的心思。\n\n因此，不少人也和瓦鲁法基斯有同样的想法，即便不是看在\"情谊\"上，中国曾经出手帮助过欧洲。也要在欧洲整体利益上来考量，如果欧盟粗暴地对中国挥起关税大棒，那么中国可能会反制，到时难免就会爆发贸易战，这显然对于欧洲的绿色转型没什么好处，而没了中国更具性价比的绿色能源方面的关键部件，欧盟想要走这条路也只会越发困难。\n\n对此，有网友认为，不要想太多了，美欧只会看重利益，不会有什么感恩之心的！\n\n欧盟之所以如此对待中国，其实就是老美的裹挟，从这也可以看出，欧盟的自主性与独立性就是个笑话。\n\n美欧炒作产能过剩简直就是双标，以前美欧产品进入中国就不是产能过剩，现在中国电动汽车进驻欧洲就是产能过剩。",

He reminded the EU of China's crucial support during the 2008 global financial crisis, which helped Europe recover quickly. Varoufakis argued that the EU's actions are unfair and counterproductive, especially given China's potential to aid Europe's green transition. The tariffs could harm EU-China relations and possibly lead to a trade war, negatively impacting both sides. Critics suggest the EU's decision is influenced by the US and highlights the EU's lack of autonomy."

        "title": "2万朝鲜军队挽回不了败局，俄朝建立同盟是一步臭棋_手机网易网",
        "body": "这两天，有关两万名朝鲜士兵进入俄乌战场的消息刷屏。俄粉们乐坏了，纷纷称赞朝军\"意志坚定\"\"作风顽强\"\"吃苦耐劳\"\"战斗力惊人\"，仿佛这两万朝军一到，俄乌战事立马改观，俄罗斯就要取得胜利。\n\n这是哪跟哪啊？\n\n俄乌战争，不同于人类历史上的任何一次战争，同二次大战时的战争形态完全两样，主要依赖信息技术、无人机和导弹，小分队、单兵化网格战术，而不是靠人海战术。朝军在这方面，会比俄军强吗？俄军都打成这样，换上一个更落后的朝军，能起多大作用，肯定是一个问号？\n\n所以，还不如派下面这样的军队去，肯定能大幅度提高俄军的士气。\n\n当然，从成本角度来看，俄罗斯每年只需为这些朝鲜士兵支付1.15亿美元，相当于每人不到六千美元。与俄罗斯自身的征兵费用以及西方国家招募雇佣兵的开支相比，这个成本确实非常低廉。至于朝鲜，缺钱缺粮就是不缺人。拿这点人换这么多美元，还省了吃喝费用，当然也认为很合算。\n\n所以双方一拍即合。\n\n网上有一种说法，说此次朝军入俄是根据双方刚签署的《全面战略伙伴关系条约》，名正言顺，而美西方由于未能让乌克兰加入北约，无法直接派遣成建制的正规军参战，吃了一个哑巴亏，所以普京这一手段相当高明。\n\n普京访问朝鲜、双方签署战略同盟这件事，牵涉的层面很广，从来不是弹尽的一方和粮绝的一方资源互换就完事了，俄罗斯人付出的外交代价其实是很大的。当然，这一点，杜文龙李莉之流不会说，司马夹头或法西斯教授也不会帮着分析。\n\n从总体态势上讲，克里姆林宫负责人时隔24年访问朝鲜，是一种放低姿态求援的表现。为了弱化这一感观，俄罗斯人还煞费苦心安排俄罗斯总统访问越南，似乎这次出访走了两个国家，不只是专程拜访朝鲜一样。但俄罗斯人和越南人签署了一堆所谓的\"战略合作协议\"，战术落实基本为零，明眼人都能看出，去不去越南是根本无所谓的，越南也不会因为俄罗斯来访就跟美国疏远，所以访越就是表演的一部分而已。\n\n俄罗斯作为五常之一，是当年制裁朝鲜的当事方和赞成方，现在却又主动毁弃\"历史文件\"，率先跟朝鲜做生意，这让他们本来就几乎为零的国际信誉进一步遭受损失。在联合国这一战后最重要的国际政治和外交工具上，先失一分。泽连斯基多次公开、直接地表示，俄罗斯人根本不可信，现在俄罗斯的做法完全坐实了泽连斯基的说法。欧洲那些原先主张跟俄罗斯谈判的政治势力，将更加不得人心。支持泽连斯基和乌克兰的人会坚定支持的信念。\n\n对朝鲜来说，最重要的邻国并非俄罗斯。在地缘政治方面，无论朝鲜或俄罗斯，都不可能任性地开展合作，还一定要顾忌到其他国家的感观。朝鲜能给俄罗斯提供的无非就是弹药和人力，俄罗斯能给朝鲜的是什么呢？是军工科技。然而朝鲜半岛这个火药桶牵扯甚广，无论俄罗斯给朝鲜的是核技术，还是核武器运载技术，都将在事实上加剧半岛及周边国家的紧张和关切。原本朝鲜在最近的两年中就不断进行所谓的卫星发射试验，实质上是远程导弹试射，已经让日韩高度紧张，现在俄罗斯又传授火箭技术，让朝鲜导弹的成熟度和命中率大大提升，日韩会怎么想？韩国已经表明，将重新考虑不直接向乌克兰销售武器的禁令，而日本自开战以来，已向乌克兰提供总额为140亿美元的各种人道主义援助和预算援助。可见，俄罗斯染指半岛，必然导致日韩加大援助乌克兰的力度。\n\n朝鲜能给的只有库存弹药，可日韩作为发达国家，拥有强大的工业能力，能提供给乌克兰的东西可多了去了。所以，普京并不是打开了军火库从里面拿走炮弹，实际他打开的是潘多拉盒子，里面飞出来的东西有些是要送命的。虽然短期内会帮助他们获得更多库存炮弹和老旧导弹，但引发的地缘政治焦虑最终可能反而让乌克兰获得收益，从而抵消俄罗斯获得的援助的收益。另一方面，日韩紧张焦虑，必定会在外交和其他国际事务上更加紧跟美国。这方面大家都懂，就不多说了。\n\n综上，普京访朝、双方签署战略合作协议，看似是一步妙棋，两国都各取所需，但实际上是一步臭棋。更因为透支了太多未来，从长远看是一步死棋。俄罗斯之所以走到这一步，归根结底还是高估了自身军事实力，同时低估了乌克兰人的抵抗意志和西方阵营坚决支持乌克兰的决心，结果只能是加速自己的失败。",

        "summary": "The article discusses the recent deployment of 20,000 North Korean soldiers to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has been widely publicized. Russian supporters are optimistic, believing these troops will significantly impact the war in Russia's favor. However, the article argues that the nature of modern warfare, which relies on technology rather than sheer numbers, makes the effectiveness of North Korean troops questionable.\n\nThe article also highlights the strategic alliance between Russia and North Korea, formalized through a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty. This move is seen as a desperate measure by Russia, which has significant diplomatic costs and further damages its international credibility. The alliance is perceived as a poor strategic decision, as it may provoke increased support for Ukraine from countries like South Korea and Japan, who are already concerned about North Korea's military capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the article suggests that the Russia-North Korea alliance and the deployment of North Korean troops are unlikely to change the course of the war and may instead exacerbate geopolitical tensions, ultimately benefiting Ukraine and its allies."

Umerov expressed gratitude and highlighted the ongoing efforts to secure more air defense systems. Both Austin and Umerov discussed Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO, with Austin supporting the idea and mentioning steps to facilitate Ukraine's membership. The aid package includes anti-tank weapons, air defense interceptors, and expedited procurement of NASAMS and Patriot missile systems. Since 2022, the U.S. has provided over $50 billion in military aid to Ukraine. However, future support may be uncertain if Donald Trump wins the upcoming presidential election, as his advisors propose linking further aid to Ukraine's engagement in peace talks with Russia, potentially altering U.S. policy and facing opposition from European allies and within the Republican Party."

        "summary": "A major European poll indicates that most European countries now believe negotiations are the best way to end the Russia-Ukraine war, rather than a complete military victory for Ukraine. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to consider a ceasefire to expedite peace talks. During a joint press conference in Kyiv, Orbán discussed the potential for a ceasefire to accelerate negotiations, while Zelensky highlighted the possibility of broad bilateral cooperation between Ukraine and Hungary.\n\nThe poll, conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations in May, surveyed 19,566 people across 15 European countries. It revealed that few respondents believe Ukraine can achieve a decisive military victory. Despite setbacks for Russian forces, most European voters support aiding Kyiv, not for a complete victory, but to strengthen Ukraine's position in future negotiations with Russia.\n\nCountries like Estonia believe Ukraine will win, while Sweden and Poland support continued fighting until all Ukrainian territory is reclaimed. Conversely, Italy, Greece, and Bulgaria view increased arms supplies to Ukraine unfavorably. Italy is notably the least supportive major European nation, and there is a lack of national consensus in countries like the Czech Republic, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has struggled to convince the French public to adopt a stronger pro-Ukraine stance, with opinions divided on supporting Ukraine's territorial recovery, pushing for peace talks, or remaining neutral. The poll's authors highlight the stability of public opinion despite the escalating conflict, noting the challenge for Western leaders in reconciling differing views on ending the war."

        "body": "美国政府6月中宣布对台销售两款攻击型无人机飞弹系统，总额约3.6亿美元。这起军售案再度掀起「疑美论」，部分台湾评论人士在电视、网路节目指控美国售台的无人机「毫无用处」、「贵得离谱」，言论经两岸媒体转载后，话题延烧至今热度不减。\n\n亚洲事实查核实验室（AFCL）透过向美国国务院查证，采访军事专家，和比对官方公开资料与相关报道，发现前述评论人在欠缺证据的情况下，传播了误导信息。\n\n台「名嘴」批军售案　两岸媒体传播发酵\n\n美东时间6月18日，美国国防安全合作局（DSCA）发布两则新闻稿，公告行政部门已通知国会，将对台湾出售720架「人员杀伤型（弹簧刀300）」等军备和服务，这笔军售约6,020万美元；另批准至多291套「反装甲型（ALTIUS 600M）」无人机系统，这笔军售约3亿美元。\n\n美国宣布对台军售后不久，台湾前立委郭正亮便在个人网路节目《亮话天下》说，「有人去查，美国这次倒货给台湾，价格是市价的五倍⋯⋯美国为什么倒货给台湾，为什么没有人要买，因为这款无人机炸弹系统在俄乌战争被俄罗斯破解了...」。\n\n《亮话天下》在YouTube「郭正亮频道」、哏传媒、中天新闻等平台播放，而郭正亮质疑「弹簧刀300」用处和价格的内容，获风传媒等媒体引述报道，并经Yahoo!新闻转载。郭正亮也在《国际直球对决》等其他节目上发表类似论述，称这笔军售「贵得离谱」，这些言论也被中时新闻网、Nownews等多家媒体引述。\n\n除了郭正亮，据中时新闻网报道，另一位「名嘴」帅化民在中天节目上，直批弹簧刀300型无人机「是垃圾」；另据中天新闻网报道，退将栗正杰在中天节目上说，美国军售台湾弹簧刀无人机，是把台湾「当盘子」（盘子：台方言，指好骗，容易被占便宜）。\n\n上述台湾评论人士的言论，不仅透过台湾各大媒体引述报道，也传到中国媒体，包括凤凰网、腾讯网转载了《海峡导报》的相关报道，也出现在台海网的微博视频号，并经多位微博、网易用户分享，在两岸舆论场上热议多日。\n\n军事专家怎么说？\n\n前述评论人的批评大致分为三点：武器太贵、没用、没人要。多数评论人士仅提出其个人见解，并未说明他们引用的数据或资料来源。亚洲事实查核实验室透过检视公开报道与资料、采访专家、向官方查证等方式，对上述言论的准确性进行验证。\n\n评论声称没有其他国家要买「弹簧刀300」，但根据制造商空境公司（AeroVironment）发布的新闻稿，以及军闻网站Army Recognition报道，法国与另一个美国盟国在2023年采购了这款攻击型无人机系统，计划今年7月交付。至于「弹簧刀300」在战场上的表现，包括《金融时报》、《国家利益》杂志等媒体都有所报导，指它体积小、技术含量相对较低，适合乌克兰抵抗运动，但随著俄罗斯改进其电子战系统，发送假讯息干扰无人机导航，乌克兰逐渐减少使用无人机。\n\n美国智库「国际评估与战略中心」资深研究员费学礼（Richard Fisher）告诉亚洲事实查核实验室，台湾迫切需要数千架此类无人机系统，以抵挡解放军的空降和两栖入侵部队，而且用各种无人机系统对抗解放军，使对方的防御需求复杂化，对台湾而言也是个好策略。费学礼并说，当然台湾也可以像乌克兰一样，把数千架中国制造的便宜业馀无人机变成武器，但这些无人机的软体有可能会被解放军控制。\n\n曾任职于美国国防部、美国在台协会（AIT）、雷神公司的胡振东（Tony Hu）则认为，乌克兰和台湾的使用情况不同，「弹簧刀300」相对适合台湾的环境，因为会用于海上，敌人没有什么建筑物可躲藏，不像在乌克兰。\n\n台湾国防部6月24日发布新闻稿说明，部分人士评论「陆军采购攻击无人机不符作战需求」陈述内容欠缺考证，并不属实。国防部并表示，各型无人机为现在战场不对称战力的重要运用方式，台湾采购的两款无人机系统，具侦打一体功能，操作简单，为美军现役装备。\n\n评论称「贵得离谱」有根据吗？\n\n部分评论人士和网红尤其关注「弹簧刀300」的价格，包括郭正亮称「有人去查，美国这次倒货给台湾，价格是市价的五倍价格」；在微博拥有390多万粉丝的「小凡好摄」称根据NBC报道称，「弹簧刀300」的建造成本仅6,000美元。\n\n亚洲事实查核实验室发现，有关「弹簧刀300」的成本，网上出现好几种金额。例如，在「小凡好摄」所引用的NBC报道中，确实提及「据估计，弹簧刀300的价格可能仅为6000美元」。但根据美国军方公开的2023财年预算文件，「弹簧刀300」的单位成本为52,914美元。\n\n然而，胡振东告诉亚洲事实查核实验室，「一个武器多少钱」这种比较没有意义，「因为台湾不是买一个飞弹，而是买capability（作战能力），所以会有训练、零件等很多东西加进去。」胡振东说明，目前在通知国会的程序，公告价格只是估计，这个阶段会把所有可能发生的事情加入，价格会比较高，双方谈合约时才是真的价钱。\n\n过去面对外界质疑F-16V采购价时，台湾空军司令部曾提出单机价格资料，显示台湾采购单价比起巴林、斯洛伐克、摩洛哥、保加利亚等采购国，并没有更贵。但空军司令部也特别说明，F-16V（BLK70/72）采购国，各国采购品项不尽相同，价格资讯为参考使用。根据DSCA的公告，台湾、巴林、斯洛伐克、摩洛哥、保加利亚虽然都向美国采购F-16V战机，但购买的商品、数量、供货期并不相同，因此以采购单价推估是否买贵，意义不大。\n\n美国国务院官员回覆亚洲事实查核实验室表示，美国政府与包括台湾在内的外国合作夥伴密切合作，并依据他们的特定需求进行对外军售。基于这些系统对台湾而言是新引进的，这笔军售案不仅涉及军备系统本身的需求，还涉及台湾成功引进与维持该系统所需的相关部件和服务。\n\n胡振东表示，部分评论者并没有实际参与军售的经验，在「乱讲」。他认为这是「疑美论」，是中国认知战的一部分，希望大部分台湾人民能够睁大眼睛，并认清错假讯息。\n\n军售案遭疑「贵五倍」不是第一次\n\n近年来美国公告对台军售后，两岸舆论场上反覆出现「疑美论」，质疑美国售台的武器「又烂又贵」。其中一例是台湾的节目主持人，时为国民党副总统候选人的赵少康，曾在去年底举办的政见会上，质疑台湾采购MQ-9B无人机买贵五倍，台湾国防部随后发布新闻稿澄清。且在台湾副总统政见会之前，台湾事实查核中心也已经针对网传「买贵五倍」的说法发布查核报告。\n\n另一例是亚洲事实查核实验室今年初发布的 《台湾花大价钱从美国买F-16「落伍战机」，是「冤大头」？ 》，查核结果为「错误」。美国之音（VOA）「揭谎频道」、台湾事实查核中心等单位，也都曾针对不同军售案的传言进行查核。\n\n根据台湾资讯环境研究中心（IORG）报告，2021年8月拜登政府首次对台军售，便出现指控所购军备是「废铁」「天价」、军售是「骗钱」的论述。然而这些年来，相似剧本不断上演，这次无人机军售案也不例外。\n\n此外，对于这件无人机军售案，台湾国防部、外交部等单位表示欢迎与感谢，中国外交部则一贯反对，指控美国对台出售武器，严重违反一个中国原则和中美三个联合公报，特别是「八一七公报」规定。有关美国对台军售是否违反「八一七公报」，亚洲事实查核实验室也曾发布详细报告。",

This sparked controversy in Taiwan, with some commentators claiming the drones were overpriced and ineffective. These claims were widely circulated in Taiwanese and Chinese media.\n\nThe Asia Fact Check Lab (AFCL) investigated these claims by consulting U.S. State Department sources, military experts, and public records. They found that the commentators lacked evidence and spread misleading information. For instance, contrary to claims that no other countries wanted the \"Switchblade 300\" drones, France and another U.S. ally had purchased them.\n\nExperts like Richard Fisher and Tony Hu argued that these drones are suitable for Taiwan's defense needs, especially against potential Chinese military actions. The Taiwan Ministry of National Defense also defended the purchase, stating the drones are crucial for asymmetric warfare.\n\nThe AFCL found discrepancies in the reported costs of the drones, noting that the actual unit cost is higher than some commentators claimed. They emphasized that the total cost includes training and maintenance, not just the drones themselves.\n\nThis incident is part of a broader pattern of skepticism towards U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, often fueled by misinformation. Despite the controversy, Taiwan's government welcomed the arms sale, while China opposed it, citing violations of the One-China principle."

        "body": "俄乌战争第861天（2024年7月3日），先来看看欧尔班访问基辅后续。\n\n7月2日，匈牙利总理欧尔班访问基辅，提出加深双边关系、参与乌克兰现代化建设、协助乌克兰政府，提供人道主义援助等。\n\n欧尔班此举更像是下注乌克兰，为匈牙利赢得最大利益。\n\n有意思的是欧尔班重申支持泽连斯基的和平倡议，不反对乌克兰采取的停战措施，但这些措施耗时太长，可以先停火再谈判。\n\n欧尔班还强调他并不坚持自己的倡议，并接受乌克兰的理由，一切取决于乌克兰。\n\n可以看出，欧尔班此次访问除了加深双边关系，下注乌克兰，还试探性劝降，以讨好俄罗斯。\n\n欧尔班试图两边下注，为匈牙利攫取利益，又倾向于利益更大的乌克兰一方，只能说趋势很清晰了。\n\n7月1日晚间，乌军用导弹袭击克里米亚塞瓦斯托波尔的黑海舰队758后勤支援中心仓库，至少90架Shahed 136无人机被摧毁。\n\n据称，S-400防空系统也被击中，详细信息仍有待澄清。\n\n7月2日，乌军袭击俄罗斯库尔斯克的俄军第3754航空技术基地 (VCH 13830)，俄军未透露损失。\n\n同一时刻，乌克兰无人艇袭击俄罗斯克拉斯诺达尔边疆区新罗西斯克港，摧毁俄军防空系统、雷达、基地的战略还在持续。\n\n一旦这些都被摧毁，对乌克兰意味着将大有可为。\n\n来看看战场最新消息，哈尔科夫地区，有报道称，俄军从哈尔科夫撤出部分部队，将其派往顿涅茨克地区发动攻势，战争研究所（ISW）也证实俄军正在顿涅茨克集结发动新攻势。\n\n俄军东一榔头西一棒槌，不断寻找乌军薄弱点试图推进，但代价很大。\n\n乌军继续向利博克（Hlyboke）、斯塔里齐亚（Starytsia）、沃夫昌斯克反击。\n\n俄军在这里并不具备优势，随着战斗持续，损失进一步增加。\n\n阿夫迪夫卡地区、马林卡-新海利夫卡地区，俄军试图继续向西推进，以拉平战线。\n\n阿夫迪夫卡与巴赫穆特之间的舒梅（Shumy）方向，这里的战斗已经持续数年，俄军推进有限。\n\n巴赫穆特地区，俄军继续围攻恰西夫亚尔，试图在卡利尼夫卡、微区、运河方向取得进展，但遭到乌军阻击。\n\n从趋势看，俄军不计代价缓慢前进，直到夺取整个顿涅茨克，这代价将非常高。\n\n扎波罗热地区，乌军夺回乌罗扎因中部地区。\n\n赫尔松地区，俄军进攻克林基被击退，乌军努力扩大这个区域的存在。\n\n库皮扬斯克-克雷明纳-莱曼地区，乌军从特尔尼、托尔斯克、佩尔绍特拉夫涅韦（Pershotravneve）等方向进攻并取得进展。\n\n亚速旅还进攻迪布罗瓦以南的森林区域，一点点向前推进。\n\n俄军从多个方向发起攻击，进展不大，损失不小。\n\n7月3日，乌克兰发布俄军损失数据，俄军每天千人以上的损失，代价可不低。\n\n7月2日，乌克兰最高拉达国家安全委员会委员伊夫琴科称，首批F-16将于本月抵达。\n\n他补充说：\"我认为，它们最初将用于防御敌方导弹，而不是瞄准俄罗斯境内的地点。\"\n\n这是乌克兰首次公开承认F-16即将抵达，俄罗斯不断袭击乌克兰可能停放F-16战机的机场也是为阻止F-16抵达。\n\nF-16具备公路起降能力，停放机场和配备的武器还未公开，可以肯定的是AIM-120空空导弹、瑞典ASC 890预警机都将为F-16战机提供支持。\n\n丹麦、挪威、荷兰和比利时计划2024年夏天向乌克兰移交60多架F-16战机，而总数是95架。\n\nF-16战机的目标应该是投掷FAB炸弹的俄军飞机和导弹，至于首秀将很快到来。\n\n在7月份北约峰会上，北约将提出一个替代乌克兰加入北约的方案，即\"新瑞典\"模式。\n\n该方案规定在没有正式成员资格的情况下，双方可以在安全和防务领域进行密切合作。\n\n而且每年向乌克兰提供400亿欧元的援助也将被讨论。\n\n北约还计划在德国威斯巴登设立一个新的指挥部，负责协调向乌方提供军事装备和训练乌军人员的工作。这项行动名为\"北约乌克兰安全援助与培训\"，将由来自32国联盟的近700名美国和其他盟国人员组成。\n\n北约还准备向乌克兰派遣常驻高级官员以确保对乌克兰的武器供应在任何情况下都不会停止\n\n所有一切表明，欧盟主席冯德莱恩、欧洲委员会秘书长贝尔塞、欧盟外交政策负责人卡拉斯、北约候任秘书长吕特，都会加强对乌克兰的援助。\n\n即使特朗普赢得美国大选、右翼势力赢得欧洲大选也不会影响乌克兰。\n\n美国国务卿布林肯宣布，加强乌克兰防空的新措施将在7月9日至11日在举行的北约峰会之前公布。\n\n7月2日，美国国防部长奥斯汀宣布，将很快向乌克兰提供23亿美元军事援助，包括更多防空拦截器、反坦克武器和其他弹药，以及为乌克兰采购更多爱国者、NASAMS防空系统。\n\n奥斯汀在社交媒体表示：\"毫无疑问，乌克兰并不孤单。\"\n\n7月3日，美国助理国务卿詹姆斯·奥布莱恩表示，如果俄罗斯试图扩大现有战线，乌克兰将能够发动更远距离的打击。\n\n目前，美国将乌克兰只能在距离边境100公里的区域内使用美国武器，乌克兰多次要求欧美国取消限制。\n\n7月2日，俄罗斯罗斯托夫的火车站，大量T-62M坦克正被运往乌克兰。\n\n俄军开始在乌克兰战场使用BMP/BMD-1装甲车上的73毫米滑膛炮自制的火炮攻击乌军阵地。\n\n加上大量摩托车、滑板车，高尔夫球车的使用，足以说明，俄军的资源并不是无限的。\n\n7月2日，佩斯科夫回答媒体提问时表示，俄罗斯\"仍愿意\"与乌克兰进行和谈，对通过第三方谈判持开放态度。\n\n乌克兰最大的问题是坚持861天，至今不投降，让俄罗斯正迅速耗尽资源，深陷其中。\n\n至今，泽连斯基没有表现出放弃领土换取和平的任何举动，乌克兰人也没有投降的想法，战斗到底，直至赢得胜利是大多数乌克兰人的选择。\n\n正如布林肯解释如何看待乌克兰的胜利，\"什么是成功？这就是乌克兰，一个强大、成功的国家，日益与西方融合，一个在军事、经济和民主上都能自立的国家。\"\n\n乌克兰的胜利并非遥不可及，一切终将值得，祝福乌克兰。",

Orbán expressed support for Ukrainian President Zelensky's peace initiatives but suggested a ceasefire before negotiations. His visit aimed to balance interests between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nUkrainian forces launched several attacks, including a missile strike on a Russian Black Sea Fleet logistics center in Sevastopol, Crimea, and an assault on a Russian airbase in Kursk. Ukrainian drones also targeted Russian defenses in Novorossiysk port. Ukrainian forces made gains in various regions, including Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, while Russian forces faced significant losses.\n\nUkraine announced the imminent arrival of the first batch of F-16 fighter jets, expected to enhance its defense capabilities. The U.S. pledged an additional $2.3 billion in military aid, including air defense systems and anti-tank weapons. NATO plans to propose a \"New Sweden\" model for Ukraine, offering close security cooperation without formal membership, and to establish a new command center in Wiesbaden, Germany, to coordinate military support.\n\nDespite ongoing conflict, Ukraine remains determined to resist and achieve victory, with continued support from Western allies."

Trump is reportedly negotiating with Russian President Vladimir Putin on how much Ukrainian land Russia can retain. Two national security experts connected to Trump indicated that the plan involves NATO not expanding eastward, particularly not into Ukraine and Georgia. Trump aims to significantly increase European contributions to NATO and make substantial adjustments to the alliance. Although U.S. law prevents a president from unilaterally withdrawing from NATO, Trump plans to reform it. His advisors suggest that Trump would reduce aid to Ukraine to force peace talks, leading to territorial concessions. Russia is betting on Trump's return to the White House, especially as President Biden faces health issues. Meanwhile, Europe and NATO are developing new mechanisms to continue supporting Ukraine, anticipating potential disruptions from Trump's possible re-election and the rise of right-wing parties in Europe."

        "body": "最近，乌克兰军队用美国给的导弹，轰炸俄罗斯平民，这件事情，给俄罗斯人带来了非常大的震撼。\n\n俄乌战争到目前为止打了两年半，俄罗斯方面因为战争造成了136名儿童的死亡，这都是战争误伤导致的。\n\n然后乌克兰反手就用导弹炸儿童，炸死了将近百人，最关键的是用的还是美国人给的导弹，解禁乌克兰对俄罗斯本土攻击权限的也是美国。美国人的盟友是真的有点绷不住。\n\n上一个让人这么绷不住的美国盟友是以色列，本轮巴以冲突打了八个月，以色列士兵直接杀死了1500名儿童，并且导致五万名儿童失去了双亲中的一人或者全部。\n\n有一说一，可能很多人都不太明白，为什么美国的盟友都喜欢公开对着小孩下手，你就是背着个媒体，偷偷干，关上灯干呢！\n\n在这件事情发生之后，美国恳求和俄罗斯进行通话，最终双方防长在时隔一年多之后终于又进行了一次对话。\n\n看到这里我就明白了，恐怕这次攻击儿童的事情，就是美国人授意这么做的。看上去是美国怂了，不小心踩了俄罗斯的底线，然后自己害怕了，但实际上这件事情不过是美国人常用的萨拉米战术，也就是切香肠战术。\n\n美国人的切香肠战术的本质是一种对底线的试探，他们会让自己的盟友不断越过一下其他人的红线。然后等踩了红线之后，在第一时间拿起电话，和你进行真诚沟通，让你不要急，不要扩大事态，并且表示这不是美国的想法，同时观察你的反应到底如何。\n\n在中东他们通过纵容以色列的激进行动来试探中东国家底线，在俄罗斯他们通过北约东扩，部署核武器，支持乌克兰作战试探俄罗斯的底线，中国就更别说了，台海，南海，贸易战 各种制裁......\n\n这个战术美国人用了无数次，屡试不爽。\n\n这样做有两个好处，一个好处是可以有效逼迫敌对国家进行妥协，只要妥协，对方的底线就会后退一步，另一个好处则是随时可以和自己的小弟进行切割，避免被卷进冲突之中。\n\n各位看，现在俄罗斯和乌克兰之间的状态就是互相拼杀消耗，偶尔乌克兰踩一踩俄罗斯的红线，只要俄罗斯生气了，美国第一时间站出来安抚俄罗斯表示这个不是他们的意思。\n\n毕竟如果俄罗斯真的被彻底激怒了，美国这边也必须跟着下场。\n\n现在他们安抚住了俄罗斯，让俄罗斯承认既定事实，接下来乌克兰会等这件事情的风波过去之后再踩一次红线。\n\n至于为什么俄罗斯要跟着美国的节奏走，原因很简单，俄罗斯也怕美国。\n\n现在美国和俄罗斯的状态是麻秆打狼两头怕美国实力不足搞不定俄罗斯，可俄罗斯也实力不足，搞乌克兰就已经是极限了。所以这就导致俄罗斯人生气了，美国人得受着，美国人给俄罗斯脸了，俄罗斯得接着。\n\n说到底这种切香肠战术能产生奇效，主要还是因为实力不足。\n\n要是像中国这样实力足够的，就不用搭理美国人了，各位看现在我们国家的外交部门还给美国人和他们的小弟脸吗？早就不给了，之前去中美元首旧金山会晤，是中国最后一次给美国脸。\n\n在这之后，中国再也没有对美国人的切香肠战术有任何反应，你把手伸过来，我就直接剁了你的狗爪子。\n\n你军演我也军演，你派遣菲律宾侵犯中国领海，我们就扣押入侵领海的菲律宾特种部队。\n\n直接以力破法。\n\n美国人对我国红线的每一次践踏都会遭受我国强力的反击，那么美国人接下来是怎么做的呢？跑了。\n\n就像我说的，美国人实力不足，当中国有实力，有底气撕碎美国的切香肠战术的时候，美国人除了跑路什么都不会做。现在美国的航母都找理由从中国周边调走了，为什么，还不是看中国不好欺负，但是中东和俄罗斯好欺负，美国人鬼精鬼精的呢。\n\n所以美国人这次面对俄罗斯只是看上去怂了而已，实际上坏心眼子多的是。真想让他们认怂，绝对的实力才是唯一的保障。",

This event has caused a major shock in Russia. The article suggests that the U.S. is using a \"salami-slicing\" tactic, where it tests the limits of its adversaries by allowing its allies to cross red lines, then quickly seeks to de-escalate tensions through diplomatic communication. This tactic aims to force adversaries into compromises while maintaining plausible deniability. The article also compares this strategy to U.S. actions in the Middle East and towards China, noting that China has responded with strong countermeasures, unlike Russia, which the article claims is more cautious due to its own limitations. The article concludes that the U.S. appears to back down only superficially and that true deterrence against such tactics requires absolute strength."

He inspected unmanned production lines and integrated production management systems, urging the sharing of these advancements with other industries. The plenary meeting, which reviewed the first half of the year's work, was held from June 28 for four days.

        "title": "中国陆权突破迎来千载良机！_手机网易网",
        "body": "这两天，中国正在哈萨克斯坦访问，不知各位看到了什么，作者看到的是\"中国陆权突破迎来千载良机\"。\n\n一直以来，中国的权力伸缩受到两大障碍：\n\n其一，向东的海权发展受到美国舰队及其构筑的岛链阻碍。这个都知道，无须多说；\n\n其二，向西则是中国的陆权发展受到俄罗斯的地域拦阻。\n\n中国要延伸自身陆权，就必然要穿越中亚，然而俄罗斯掌控着中亚一直不肯放开，这其实就拦阻了中国陆权延伸。典型代表就是自1997年就开始构想的中吉乌铁路一直未能如愿，直到27年后的今天才有所进展，原因正在于毛熊。\n\n虽然有中欧班列，但路线基本都要通过俄罗斯领土，很容易被卡住。\n\n中国当然也可以强行突破，与毛熊争夺中亚影响力，但在当前美国是主要对手，在中俄需要联手破敌的局势下，与俄交恶显然并不明智。\n\n其实，不光是俄罗斯。向南印度也不愿看到中国陆权发展，所以不但利用自身版图，也利用美国占领时的阿富汗在积极向北经营。\n\n虽然阿富汗是一个弱乱之地，但它也是一个战略要地。英国、前苏联及美国都入侵过阿富汗，原因就在于它的战略位置非常重要，向北可以阻拦苏俄经中亚南下，向南则可虎视印度，向西可以扼守伊朗中东，向东则可以拦阻中国。美国曾万里迢迢去侵占阿富汗，并非吃饱了没事干。\n\n正因为上述局势，长期以来中国向西的陆权突破不太容易，很大程度上只有\"中国 -- -- 巴基斯坦 -- -- 伊朗\"这一条裂缝，还不时受到美印支持的恐怖组织干扰。\n\n不过时间来到如今，一切都在变了。\n\n美国出于战略收缩，奥巴马时代便开始从中东撤军，致使中东不断出现权力真空，使得中东受美国掌控不断减弱。2021年美国又从阿富汗撤军，这为中国的陆权突破奠定了初步机遇。\n\n2022年，俄乌战争爆发，它为中亚带来了两个影响。其一是俄罗斯因为俄乌战争不得不逐渐放开中亚，出于利益交换，也由于战争中的大毛对中亚掌控力减弱；其二，俄乌战争也让中亚颇为惊惧，因为中亚知道，毛熊今天能吞乌克兰，明天就能吞掉它们，所以中亚各国也必须寻求更多的外部力量来平衡俄罗斯影响力，从而减小乃至摆脱俄罗斯控制。\n\n同时，未被美国占领的阿富汗，印度想要染指也更加困难，中间还受到巴基斯坦的阻隔就更难。\n\n这些局势，就为中国向西的陆权突破创造了千载良机。如果不是俄乌战争让俄罗斯放开中亚，若是美国继续占领着阿富汗，中国要想向西突破恐怕依旧不容易。\n\n正是这种良机，搞了27年始终搞不定的中吉乌铁路终于在今年达成了，\"中国 -- -- 中亚 -- -- 中东\"的合作不断推进加深，中国这两天访问哈萨克斯坦，不出意外的话应该会有不少成果，比如开放更多中哈口岸什么的。\n\n一旦中国的陆地发展不受阻碍，经中亚、阿富汗与巴基斯坦，便能直通中东、北非、南欧及整个欧洲，大利。如下图\n\n应该说，一场俄乌战争给我们带来了不少收益，原本阻拦的中亚现在不断放开了，一直搞不成的中吉乌铁路如今达成了，远东也在适当放开，图门江出海口已见黎明......\n\n仅仅要注意的，是防止毛熊祸水东引。\n\n作者一直有个感觉，毛熊似乎在等待中美直接干起来，这样它将实现扩充了版图还能解套。早前它打乌克兰一直打得漫不经心，估计就是在等待这一机遇，直到佩洛西窜台后，看到中美没干起来才打得认真。如今毛熊似乎又在观望中美在菲律宾、台海这些地带过招。\n\n还有，毛熊前不久访问朝鲜，还结成同盟并让北朝出兵，要防止由此牵动韩国并进一步牵出美国与北约或亚太小北约，并最终激化半岛局势，一旦半岛有事，中国也就难以置身事外。当中美直接对阵，毛熊将自动解套，还会被美国拉拢。防范毛熊祸水东引，这是我们要注意的。\n\n总之，只要中国能保持战略定力，能压制周边战火不累及自身，当俄罗斯陷在乌克兰，美国陷在中东，当它们不断身陷困境时，中国的战略性收益就会不断叠加，有些已经拿到手，还有些正在路上。",

        "summary": "The article discusses China's strategic opportunity to expand its land power westward, particularly through Central Asia, due to recent geopolitical shifts. Historically, China's land power expansion has been hindered by Russia's control over Central Asia and the U.S. presence in Afghanistan. However, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and Russia's preoccupation with the Ukraine war have created a power vacuum in Central Asia. This has allowed China to advance projects like the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway, which had been stalled for 27 years. The article highlights China's recent visit to Kazakhstan as a sign of deepening cooperation in the region. The author warns of potential risks, such as Russia's strategic maneuvers and the possibility of escalating tensions in the Korean Peninsula, which could complicate China's plans. Overall, the article suggests that China stands to gain significantly if it can navigate these challenges and maintain strategic stability."

        "body": "俄乌战争爆发以前，在世界上一发155毫米炮弹1500美元，俄乌战争爆发以后，美国和欧盟在全世界为乌克兰订购155毫米炮弹，价格也从2000美元、3000美元、4000美元一路上涨到8000美元一发。\n\n很多国家看到了发财的机会，特别是那些经济困难的中小国家都看到了可以大赚一笔的机会。巴基斯坦现在负债上千亿美元，不仅每年都要偿还贷款和利息。而且，还要花费大量外汇进口钢材、能源、粮食和工业产品。\n\n巴基斯坦本身没有石油天然气出口赚钱，也没有大量工业产品可以发财。俄乌战争价格暴涨8倍的155毫米炮弹就让巴基斯坦看到了赚钱的机会。\n\n美国《新闻周刊》报道，巴基斯坦正在将炮弹出售给乌克兰。而美国主导的国际货币基金组织则向巴基斯坦提供援助。其实就是换一个思路，美国付给巴基斯坦炮弹钱。\n\n巴基斯坦从哪里得到这么多155毫米炮弹？巴基斯坦在2020年以5.12亿美元，从我国进口了432门S-15型155毫米口径卡车炮，装备了24个炮兵营。\n\n这批我国产155毫米卡车炮就配套有大量155毫米炮弹，全是北约标准，可以在北约制造155毫米榴弹炮发射。可以说是量大还便宜，转手就能拿到几倍价格。\n\n巴基斯坦这个中立就是两边都要占到好处。巴基斯坦有这么多炮弹可以高价出售。俄罗斯必须要拉拢巴基斯坦。为此俄罗斯也与巴基斯坦签署了一项原油协议，可以向巴基斯坦提供便宜原油。\n\n芬兰-乌克兰防务协会最近也表示，我国生产的155毫米炮弹便宜，数量大。该组织也想通过第三方渠道引进该炮弹，再转售给乌克兰。\n\n其实，俄乌前线，乌军无人机多的一群一顿的，天天发动蜂群攻击。乌克兰哪里来的这么多无人机？\n\n我国宣布禁止向俄乌战区出口无人机以后。乌克兰没办法进口无人机了，但是欧盟和其他亲西方国家却在大量进口我国无人机，再转手送给乌克兰。\n\n这个路数，就与俄罗斯为躲过西方制裁。就通过第三方国家与公司大量引进被禁止的机床，军民两用产品和电子零配件的办法一样。\n\n俄罗斯军工有多大产能？\n\n英国皇家联合军种研究所报告称，在2024年俄罗斯国防工业将可以生产100万发152毫米炮弹，在2022年俄罗斯152毫米炮弹产量只有25万发。\n\n在2024年，俄罗斯122毫米火箭弹产量将达到50万发。大口径火箭弹产量达到1.7万发。每年生产420枚KH-101型巡航导弹，伊斯坎尔德弹道导弹产量也要增加2倍。\n\n俄罗斯Shahed-136 无人机每月产量250架。坦克装甲车则要把产量提高到1年1500辆坦克和3000辆各种装甲车辆。其中85%为库存坦克装甲车翻新升级。\n\n最新型的BMP-3步兵战车产能将达到1个季度135辆。俄罗斯国防部评估，西方制裁已导致俄罗斯军事装备和武器使用的关键微电子元件价格上涨 30%。\n\n俄罗斯新动员的部队，一个志愿者将可以得到2230美元联邦签约奖金，然后还可以得到5730美元州地区奖金，3500美元州长奖金。就是说志愿兵只要签约，就可以先拿到1.1万美元奖金，其他工资补贴再单独计算。\n\n英国皇家联合军种研究所报告称，俄罗斯正在不断加强对乌军压力，摧毁乌克兰基础设施，延长战争时间，加大乌克兰付出的代价。\n\n俄罗斯这样的目的是加速乌克兰资源衰竭，继续延长冲突的时间、空间和资源，目的是耗尽乌克兰军队和基辅政府持续抵抗俄罗斯军事打击的能力。最终迫使基辅政府签署符合俄罗斯利益的停战协议。",

These shells were originally imported from China in 2020.\n\n3. **U.S. Involvement**: The U.S. is indirectly funding Pakistan's ammunition sales to Ukraine through the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n4. **Third-Party Transactions**: Both Ukraine and Russia are using third-party countries to circumvent direct sanctions and embargoes, with Ukraine receiving drones and other military supplies through such channels.\n\n5. **Russian Military Production**: Russia is ramping up its military production, aiming to significantly increase the output of artillery shells, rockets, drones, and armored vehicles by 2024.\n\n6. **Western Sanctions**: Sanctions have increased the cost of key electronic components for Russian military equipment by 30%.\n\n7. **Russian Strategy**: Russia is intensifying its military pressure on Ukraine, aiming to deplete Ukrainian resources and force a favorable ceasefire agreement.\n\nThe article underscores the complex international dynamics and economic implications of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict."

The vote, which lacks legal validity, was conducted without any official oversight, and its results were published solely by the organizing committee, raising questions about their authenticity. The Russian government has labeled FNRF as an \"undesirable organization\" due to its perceived threat to national security and constitutional order.

        "title": "美空军下一代战斗机NGAD计划为何出现逆转？_手机网易网",
        "body": "\"我们将不得不在未来几年内对NGAD做出选择\"，美国空军参谋长戴维·阿尔文在美国空军和太空军协会（AFA）的一次活动中对NGAD表态。美国空军部长弗兰克·肯德尔最近也告诉《航空周刊》，预算限制迫使美国空军重新审视其NGAD计划。\n\n按照美空军计划，在2024年将发布下一代空中优势飞机的工程和制造开发合同。该计划于去年宣布后，洛克希德·马丁公司和波音公司即开始了竞争。NGAD是美军的第一架第六代战斗机。美国海军也有一个类似的同名项目，致力于建造第六代战斗机，称为F/A-XX。\n\n当时，肯德尔在一份声明中说，\"NGAD平台是空中优势系统系列的重要组成部分，它代表了F-22技术的代际飞跃，它将取代F-22\"。他强调，\"NGAD将包括增强的杀伤力和在空中生存、持久、互操作和适应的能力等属性，所有这些都是在竞争激烈的作战环境中进行的。没有人比美国空军做得更好，但如果我们现在不向前迈进，我们将失去这种优势。\"\n\n如今，\"空军的下一代空中优势战斗机在2026财年预算中面临不确定的未来。\"阿尔文表示，美国空军不打算让单架协同作战飞机服役很长时间，而是倾向于迅速转向自主无人机的未来迭代。阿尔文解释道：\"需要明确的是，审议仍在进行中。尚未做出任何决定。我们正在考虑许多我们必须考虑的非常困难的选择。\"\n\n美空军领导层是否在考虑对冲NGAD计划，目前尚不明朗。但对仍处在竞争中的洛克希德·马丁公司和波音公司来说将面临困境，因为NGAD计划曾是美空军的首要任务，所以两家公司为了赢得合同都已进行了大量投入，如果该计划被取消，无疑将对竞争者造成巨大打击。\n\n在行业方面必然也将影响到供应商，因为那些供应商也一直在为下一代空中优势系统做准备，却在突然之间迎来一个\"不确定的未来\"，这让他们不得不去面对和承受。\n\n美国空军对下一代空中优势NGAD计划的这些微妙变化，不仅给军界、商家及行业带来诸多困惑，而且对美空军的下一代战斗机等装备发展也将产生重要影响。\n\n那么，美国空军曾经的首选项目NGAD为何会出现如此逆转？\n\n首先，预算限制迫使美国空军重新审视其NGAD计划。预算限制促使美空军对NGAD犹豫不决，因为研发和购买下一代战斗机的费用太高了，购买这种战斗机单价的费用就预计约为3亿美元，何况美空军计划在未来几年内在F-35、新型B-21\"突袭者\"轰炸机、下一代\"哨兵\"洲际弹道导弹等项目上花费越来越多的资金。目前，美空军正在制定2026财年的预算，该预算将比2025年更加紧张，部分原因是像\"哨兵\"洲际弹道导弹更新这样的大型项目的成本远远超过最初预期。美空军要一并考虑为\"哨兵\"洲际导弹飙升的成本提供资金、进一步开发B-21、采购F-35等，同时应对国会预算上限、通货膨胀和其他资源拖累。实际上，美空军的预算正在寻求平衡\"今天的风险与明天的风险，现代化与今天的准备状态\"。\n\n其次，新技术发展使得美空军重新思考空中优势的未来。俄乌战争中的无人机和其他新技术正在改变战争的性质，美空军领导层认为，不能追求将所有\"鸡蛋放在一个篮子里\"，因为如果威胁加剧，他们将无法转向。所以，美空军可能将重新考虑其制造非常昂贵且高度复杂的飞机的计划。如果NGAD被取消，五角大楼可能会让洛克希德·马丁公司的F-35飞机服役更长时间，从而为国防巨头带来更多资金。考虑到美空军需要支付的所有项目，以及发展其新的协作战斗机项目的愿望，NGAD可能是美空军唯一可以削减的项目。\n\n观念的改变也是美空军\"逆转\"NGAD计划的动因。虽然现在判断NGAD是否会被取消还为时过早，但美空军领导人最近的言论却表明\"非常突然的逆转\"。以往新一代飞机的设计理念强调\"经久耐用\"的固有观念。如今这一切正在改变，如无人机与有人驾驶战斗机协同执行任务，这些无人战斗机不会维持25年或30年，因为它们便宜且快速迭代。值得注意的是，美国空军还可能重新考虑其整体作战概念，如依赖B-21、无人驾驶战斗机和对峙武器，而不再是传统飞机。\n\n因此，无论是受预算的限制，还是对新技术冲击的担忧，以及对有人战斗机设计未来的不确定性，目前都还有许多悬而未决的问题。正像美国航空航天咨询公司董事总经理理查德·阿布拉菲亚所说，美国空军可能在NGAD上摇摆不定，因为它正在处理一个\"真正悲惨的选择\"。",

        "summary": "The U.S. Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program is facing significant uncertainty due to budget constraints and evolving technological considerations. Key points include:\n\n1. **Budget Constraints**: U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff David Alvin and Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall have indicated that financial limitations are forcing a reassessment of the NGAD program. The high costs of developing and purchasing the next-generation fighter, estimated at around $300 million per unit, are a major concern.\n\n2. **Technological Shifts**: The emergence of new technologies, such as drones, and lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war are prompting the Air Force to reconsider its strategy. There is a growing preference for rapidly evolving autonomous drones over long-serving manned aircraft.\n\n3. **Industry Impact**: Companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which have heavily invested in competing for the NGAD contract, face potential setbacks if the program is canceled. This uncertainty also affects suppliers preparing for the next-generation air dominance systems.\n\n4. **Strategic Re-evaluation**: The Air Force is contemplating a shift away from traditional, expensive, and complex aircraft towards a mix of B-21 bombers, drones, and standoff weapons. This reflects a broader change in military strategy and operational concepts.\n\n5. **Uncertain Future**: No final decisions have been made, but the Air Force's leadership is considering difficult choices. The potential cancellation of NGAD could lead to extended use of existing platforms like the F-35.\n\nIn summary, the NGAD program's future is uncertain due to budgetary pressures, technological advancements, and strategic shifts, impacting both the military and defense industry stakeholders."

        "body": "一场电视辩论，极有可能改变世界。\n\n拜登的衰老让大家惊掉下巴，反观特朗普，表现虽然难说完美，但依然超过拜登。在随后的观众问卷调查中，有近7成的人认可特朗普表现更好。白宫：拜登没有老年痴呆症！\n\n还有一个细节很有意思，辩论结束后，特朗普健步如飞走回后台，而拜登却要在妻子的搀扶下，亦步亦趋地走下台阶。\n\n惨淡的表现，让一些媒体人开始为拜登退选造势。白宫：拜登没有老年痴呆症！\n\n不过，如果你还停留在\"两个80岁的老头还在为一份工作挣得脸红耳赤，我们还有什么理由躺平？\"的吃瓜阶段，丝毫感受不到扑面而来的大变化，那你就很可能成为未来吃瓜群众吃瓜的材料。\n\n百年未有之大变局，变的和被变的，都有很多。\n\n客观地说，拜登这四年，工作做得还是可以的。\n\n对内熬过了新冠疫情，对外重新团结了盟友。\n\n虽然引发了大通胀，国外也出现了俄乌、巴以冲突，但还是硬生生让美国经济扛过了最猛烈的加息周期，以及地缘冲突的负面影响，还意外地吃到了AI产业的红利。\n\n现在回过头看，不管以何种角度，美国都算是过去4年，混乱的国际政经局势下最大的赢家。\n\n只不过，天下没有不散之宴席。工作做得再好，年纪始终是一个无法逾越的障碍。\n\n拜登今年已经82岁，用中国人的话说，是耄耋之年。\n\n马化腾说过一句话：有时候你什么都没做错，错就错在你太老了。\n\n这句话其实也很适合拜登。\n\n不管怎么样，拜登这一次大选，输的概率还是不小的。\n\n美国的博彩网站，就已经就大选结果进行押注。\n\n如果觉得博彩网站不靠谱，那就说说民调吧。\n\n据民意调查和市场预测聚合平台InteractivePolls，辩论前，特朗普的支持率为59%，拜登为34%，而在辩论后，特朗普的支持率升至65%，拜登的支持率则下滑至23%。\n\n所以，媒体大谈拜登退选，绝不能简单地说是捕风捉影，这个时候拜登如果退选，大家也不要觉得有什么奇怪，大概就是顺坡下驴而已。\n\n虽然拜登的家人、白宫都声称支持拜登继续角逐总统，但美国选民也会掂量，难道我们真的要把希望寄托在一个开始老年痴呆的老人身上吗？万一拜登在任上出现什么不测，国家又该如何是好，尽管按照美国的制度，副总统完全可以履行总统职务，但明知道有这个风险，为什么要冒？\n\n如果拜登退选，民主党现在也没有谁能够真的担当他的替补，最大呼声的加州州长纽森，还略显稚嫩，至于再后面的，两名女将，就更扯了。\n\n反观特朗普，胜率正在攀升。现在，很多机构都在为特朗普重新上台做准备，金融圈算是其中一个最积极的地方。大摩刚刚发表了最新研报，对特朗普重新上台导致的经济和金融状况展开分析。\n\n如果说之前还摇摆不定，看不清方向，那么现在，是时候为特朗普重回白宫做准备了。\n\n变，亦或不变？\n\n要做准备，就需要明白特朗普回来之后导致的变与不变。\n\n先说不变的。\n\n针对东方肯定是不会变的，考虑到特朗普是做生意出身，贸易和科技打压应该是重中之重，这点其实和拜登没有区别，也足以证明美国两党在这个问题上的一致性。\n\n所以，不要抱有侥幸，一点都不要有。出口这边的压力还是不小的，以美国的号召力，其他主要市场基本都会靠边站。最近欧洲跟随美国脚步对咱电动车加征关税，连印尼也在加征关税，就是最好的例子。\n\n在高科技领域上，特别是现在最火的AI，芯片和软件系统，基本也不会给咱用。这些方面我们都是要继续做好准备。\n\n其次，是美国优先的原则，大量的美国公司可能会将产业搬回美国，不要说新兴国家，就算是一个老牌盟友的产业，都有可能会被特朗普拉回去。\n\n最后，变的可能美国的海外政策。\n\n最具威胁的，是特朗普会不会信守自己的承诺，以最快的速度结束俄乌战争。他在公开场合不止一次表达过，自己如果当上总统，一天就可以结束战争。\n\n别以为他信口雌黄，实际上他是可以做得到的，因为如今俄罗斯也深陷战争泥潭，战略空间越来越小，而且被全球绝大部分的主流国家隔绝，他们也在寻求出路。\n\n做生意是交换，玩政治更是交换，只是政治上的利益交换要大得多。\n\n深谙此道的特朗普，如果拿得出足够的筹码和普京交换，比如选择让出乌克兰被占领的4个州，以换取俄罗斯收兵并承诺不再进攻欧洲，你说这是不是俄罗斯想要的？又是不是比简单地输送华强北的无人机零配件要好得多？\n\n其实，以现在俄罗斯的实力，继续耗下去，绝非上策，他也不可能对抗得了整个北约。现在缺的，就是一个利益交换的筹码和契机。\n\n我们不知道特朗普会拿出什么筹码和普京交换，但谁都知道，美国手里的筹码，才是真正让俄罗斯流口水的筹码。\n\n而俄罗斯，其实也有美国想要的筹码。\n\n至于什么筹码，回看一下60多年前的那段历史，大概就明白了。\n\n如果特朗普回来，经济如何？股市又会如何？\n\n因为是商人出身，特朗普搞经济确实有一手，这个不得不服，他第一任期的时候就如此。\n\n在任期间，美国GDP的增速每年都超过2%，股市表现也挺好，2020年新冠疫情除外。\n\n也正是他果断地无底线放水，给居民发钱，使得美国安然度过新冠疫情，即使引发了后来的通胀，但最后也没有让美国经济崩溃。\n\n说起特朗普的政策，其实并没有太多新鲜事，就是减税、放水，外加产业回迁。一连串组合拳下来，企业有钱有生意，美国人有工作，这些事其实拜登也在做，只不过特朗普可能会更加极端一点。\n\n这对于美国经济，是好事，对美股也是好事。唯一不好的，可能是通胀，以及因为通胀多引发的货币政策变化，以及潜在的经济风险。\n\n大摩刚刚表示，特朗普赢得美国总统大选的可能性上升，在这种情形下，美国经济增长可能会放缓，通胀则可能加速，这使得押注美债收益率曲线变陡正变得有吸引力。\n\n投资者需要做好风险对冲。\n\n至于我们这边，货币政策大概率会跟随美联储，那边降我们才敢继续维持宽松。\n\n降了之后，就看流动性对于经济影响如何，但老美降息不可能一步到位，我们经济回暖同样也是，所以对于国内市场来说，短期内流动性大概率还是空转，那股市大概率就跟现在区别不大。\n\n其实拜登退或不退，大概率都不会影响美国的走向，但可能会加速世界局势的变化。\n\n最近几年，大家都能够感受到一个明显的变化：世界正在重新走向两个极端，而且这种两极化，和几十年前很类似。\n\n就说一个很简单的，经济模式，有的国家加强了政府管制，从自由回归到政府控制。而有的国家则强推自由化。\n\n最大的例子，要数阿根廷，在一个疯狂经济学家米莱的试验下，各种骚操作，大有不把阿根廷折腾到底不罢休的意思。\n\n为什么会这样？\n\n因为这可能是解决眼前困难最快的方法。\n\n为什么如今西方世界集体向右看？\n\n那是因为历史上这样的成功例子很多，典型的要数1980年代，由里根和撒切尔夫人推行的自由化改革。他们都深受新自由主义经济思想的影响，他们认为减少政府对经济的干预，通过减税、去管制等措施能够激发市场活力，促进自由竞争，从而实现经济的繁荣。\n\n更重要的一点，撒切尔夫人和里根都坚定地反对苏联，他们的新自由主义政策也是对苏联的一种意识形态上的对抗，他们试图通过自由化改革来证明西方制度的优越性。\n\n很多年之后，他们或许才发现，自己号称的所谓自由世界，结果活成了当年苏联的样子：尽养了一堆权贵和闲人。大公司越来越垄断，有权的人越来越横，有钱的人越来越富。\n\n所以，他们要重新拥抱自由，拥抱竞争，说白了，就是谁行谁上，不行的，下来。\n\n他们的路到底对不对，等时间去证明吧。\n\n但是，如果不走那样的路子，不用证明也知道，结果一定不会好到哪里去。白宫：拜登没有老年痴呆症！",

        "summary": "The article discusses the recent television debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, highlighting Biden's perceived frailty and Trump's stronger performance. A significant portion of the audience favored Trump, with post-debate polls showing an increase in his support. The White House has denied claims that Biden has dementia, despite his age-related challenges.\n\nThe article notes that Biden's presidency has had successes, such as handling the COVID-19 pandemic and uniting allies, but also faced issues like inflation and international conflicts. It suggests that Biden's age (82) is a significant obstacle for his re-election chances, with some media speculating about his potential withdrawal from the race.\n\nTrump's potential return to the presidency is discussed, with expectations of continued tough policies on trade and technology, particularly against China. The article also speculates on Trump's ability to end the Russia-Ukraine war through strategic negotiations.\n\nThe economic implications of a Trump presidency are considered, with predictions of slowed economic growth and accelerated inflation. The article concludes by reflecting on the broader geopolitical shifts and the increasing polarization of global economic policies."

        "summary": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump, who is actively participating in the 2024 presidential election, has repeatedly claimed that he could resolve the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours if re-elected. During the first debate of the election on June 27, Trump reiterated this claim, stating he could solve the conflict even before his potential inauguration. However, Russian officials, including Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, have dismissed Trump's assertions as unrealistic and lacking substantive details. Peskov emphasized that any peace plan proposed by a future Trump administration must reflect the current situation in Ukraine. Nebenzia criticized Western support for Ukraine and dismissed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's peace proposals as impractical. The ongoing conflict, which began in February 2022, remains unresolved, with significant geopolitical implications."

        "summary": "European officials have reported that Chinese and Russian companies are collaborating to develop and test an attack drone similar to the Iranian Shahed drones used in Ukraine, indicating potential lethal military aid from Beijing to Moscow. The project began last year and has now reached the development and testing phase, with plans to ship the drones to Russia. These drones have not yet been deployed in Ukraine.\n\nSince the Russia-Ukraine war began, Russia has used thousands of Iranian Shahed drones and even built a factory for their mass production. Russia continues to rely on supplies from countries like North Korea and Iran, and on China for key components. European officials are concerned that China could produce these drones faster than Iran or Russia.\n\nThe specific drone being developed by Chinese and Russian companies has not been disclosed, but reports suggest it may be similar to the Chinese \"Sunflower-200\" suicide drone, which resembles the Iranian Shahed-136.\n\nDespite warnings from the U.S. and other Western nations against providing lethal weapons to Russia, this collaboration suggests deepening support from Beijing to Moscow. Some countries view supplying attack drones as crossing a line into providing lethal aid.\n\nThe U.S. assesses that China is considering sending fully assembled drones to Russia but is currently shipping parts that can be converted into attack drones. The U.S. has not concluded that China is providing lethal aid, though other countries might interpret the situation differently.\n\nChina has also been reported to supply Russia with satellite imagery, microelectronics, and other materials that can be used for military purposes. The Chinese embassy in the U.S. denies providing weapons to any party in the Ukraine conflict and emphasizes China's call for dialogue and peace.\n\nU.S. NATO Ambassador Julianne Smith stated that China claims neutrality in the Ukraine war but has provided dual-use components that enable Russia's aggression. NATO aims to expose China's support for Russia and warn of the risks involved."

        "summary": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspected an arms factory following the conclusion of the 10th Plenary Meeting of the 8th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. During his visit, he emphasized the need to promote the modernization of production processes across all economic sectors. Kim reviewed the factory's unmanned production lines and integrated production management system, urging the enhancement of production command informatization and the sharing of these advancements with other economic fields. He also visited a machinery plant and a medical equipment factory.\n\nThe plenary meeting, which Kim chaired, began on June 28 and lasted four days, summarizing the first half of the year's work. Kim positively assessed the economic situation, noting an upward trend. Analysts suggest that Kim's immediate visit to the arms factory aimed to encourage party officials to extend military production modernization achievements to other sectors.\n\nNorth Korea has been accelerating its military industry development, with experts suggesting this move aims to bolster defense capabilities and potentially capitalize on opportunities arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Kim had previously inspected military enterprises multiple times in May."

        "summary": "The news article addresses claims circulating on social media about an online referendum held in five Russian regions regarding their independence from Russia. This referendum, initiated in February 2023 by the anti-Russian organization Free Nations of PostRussia Forum (FNRF), lacks legal validity and official recognition. The FNRF, deemed an \"undesirable organization\" by the Russian Prosecutor General's Office for threatening constitutional order and security, conducted the vote without any certified oversight, casting doubt on the authenticity of the results. The Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology, and Mass Media has since restricted access to the voting website. The article clarifies that the purported referendum results, which suggest significant support for independence in these regions, are not credible and have been disseminated solely by the FNRF."

        "title": "传播观察｜\"疑美\"热点解析：美国对台军售\"又烂又贵\"？",
        "body": "美国政府6月中宣布对台销售两款攻击型无人机飞弹系统，总额约3.6亿美元。这起军售案再度掀起\"疑美论\"，部分台湾评论人士在电视、网路节目指控美国售台的无人机\"毫无用处\"\"贵得离谱\"，言论经两岸媒体转载后，话题延烧至今热度不减。\n\n亚洲事实查核实验室（AFCL）通过向美国国务院查证，采访军事专家，和比对官方公开资料与相关报道，发现前述评论人在欠缺证据的情况下，传播了误导信息。\n\n台\"名嘴\"批军售案 两岸媒体传播发酵\n\n美东时间6月18日，美国国防安全合作局（DSCA）发布两则新闻稿，公告行政部门已通知国会，将对台湾出售720架\"人员杀伤型（弹簧刀300）\"等军备和服务，这笔军售约6020万美元；另批准至多291套\"反装甲型（ALTIUS 600M）\"无人机系统，这笔军售约3亿美元。\n\n美国宣布对台军售后不久，台湾前立委郭正亮便在个人网路节目《亮话天下》说，\"有人去查，美国这次倒货给台湾，价格是市价的五倍⋯⋯美国为什么倒货给台湾，为什么没有人要买，因为这款无人机炸弹系统在俄乌战争被俄罗斯破解了⋯⋯\"。\n\n《亮话天下》在YouTube\"郭正亮频道\"、哏传媒、中天新闻等平台播放，而郭正亮质疑\"弹簧刀300\"用处和价格的内容，获风传媒等媒体引述报道，并经Yahoo!新闻转载。郭正亮也在《国际直球对决》等其他节目上发表类似论述，称这笔军售\"贵得离谱\"，这些言论也被中时新闻网、Nownews等多家媒体引述。\n\n除了郭正亮，据中时新闻网报道，另一位\"名嘴\"帅化民在中天节目上，直批弹簧刀300型无人机\"是垃圾\"；另据中天新闻网报道，退将栗正杰在中天节目上说，美国军售台湾弹簧刀无人机，是把台湾\"当盘子\"（盘子：台方言，指好骗，容易被占便宜）。\n\n上述台湾评论人士的言论，不仅透过台湾各大媒体引述报道，也传到中国媒体，包括凤凰网、腾讯网转载了《海峡导报》的相关报道，也出现在台海网的微博视频号，并经多位微博、网易用户分享，在两岸舆论场上热议多日。\n\n军事专家怎么说？\n\n前述评论人的批评大致分为三点：武器太贵、没用、没人要。多数评论人士仅提出其个人见解，并未说明他们引用的数据或资料来源。亚洲事实查核实验室透过检视公开报道与资料、采访专家、向官方查证等方式，对上述言论的准确性进行验证。\n\n评论声称没有其他国家要买\"弹簧刀300\"，但根据制造商空境公司（AeroVironment）发布的新闻稿，以及军闻网站Army Recognition报道，法国与另一个美国盟国在2023年采购了这款攻击型无人机系统，计划今年7月交付。至于\"弹簧刀300\"在战场上的表现，包括《金融时报》《国家利益》杂志等媒体都有所报道，指它体积小、技术含量相对较低，适合乌克兰抵抗运动，但随著俄罗斯改进其电子战系统，发送假信息干扰无人机导航，乌克兰逐渐减少使用无人机。\n\n美国智库\"国际评估与战略中心\"资深研究员费学礼（Richard Fisher）告诉亚洲事实查核实验室，台湾迫切需要数千架此类无人机系统，以抵挡解放军的空降和两栖入侵部队，而且用各种无人机系统对抗解放军，使对方的防御需求复杂化，对台湾而言也是个好策略。费学礼并说，当然台湾也可以像乌克兰一样，把数千架中国制造的便宜业余无人机变成武器，但这些无人机的软体有可能会被解放军控制。\n\n曾任职于美国国防部、美国在台协会（AIT）、雷神公司的胡振东（Tony Hu）则认为，乌克兰和台湾的使用情况不同，\"弹簧刀300\"相对适合台湾的环境，因为会用于海上，敌人没有什么建筑物可躲藏，不像在乌克兰。\n\n台湾国防部6月24日发布新闻稿说明，部分人士评论\"陆军采购攻击无人机不符作战需求\"陈述内容欠缺考证，并不属实。国防部并表示，各型无人机为现在战场不对称战力的重要运用方式，台湾采购的两款无人机系统，具侦打一体功能，操作简单，为美军现役装备。\n\n评论称\"贵得离谱\"有根据吗？\n\n部分评论人士和网红尤其关注\"弹簧刀300\"的价格，包括郭正亮称\"有人去查，美国这次倒货给台湾，价格是市价的五倍价格\"；在微博拥有390多万粉丝的\"小凡好摄\"称根据NBC报道称，\"弹簧刀300\"的建造成本仅6000美元。\n\n亚洲事实查核实验室发现，有关\"弹簧刀300\"的成本，网上出现好几种金额。例如，\"小凡好摄\"所引用的NBC报道中，确实提及\"据估计，弹簧刀300的价格可能仅为6000美元。\"但根据美国军方公开的2023财年预算文件，\"弹簧刀300\"的单位成本为52914美元。\n\n然而，胡振东告诉亚洲事实查核实验室，\"一个武器多少钱\"这种比较没有意义，\"因为台湾不是买一个飞弹，而是买capability（作战能力），所以会有训练、（零）部件等很多东西加进去。\"胡振东说明，目前在通知国会的程序，公告价格只是估计，这个阶段会把所有可能发生的事情加入，价格会比较高，双方谈合约时才是真的价钱。\n\n过去面对外界质疑F-16V采购价时，台湾空军司令部曾提出单机价格资料，显示台湾采购单价比起巴林、斯洛伐克、摩洛哥、保加利亚等采购国，并没有更贵。但空军司令部也特别说明，F-16V（BLK70/72）采购国，各国采购品项不尽相同，价格资讯为参考使用。根据DSCA的公告，台湾、巴林、斯洛伐克、摩洛哥、保加利亚虽然都向美国采购F-16V战机，但购买的品项、数量、供货期程并不相同，因此以采购单价推估是否买贵，意义不大。\n\n美国国务院官员回复亚洲事实查核实验室表示，美国政府与包括台湾在内的外国合作伙伴密切合作，依据他们的特定需求进行对外军售。基于这些系统对台湾而言是新引进的，这笔军售案不仅涉及军备系统本身的需求，还涉及台湾成功引进与维持该系统所需的相关部件和服务。\n\n胡振东表示，部分评论人士并没有实际参与军售的经验，在\"乱讲\"。他认为这是\"疑美论\"，是中国认知战的一部分，希望大部分台湾人民能够睁大眼睛，认清错假信息。\n\n军售案遭疑\"贵五倍\"不是第一次\n\n近几年美国公告对台军售后，两岸舆论场上反复出现\"疑美论\"，质疑美国售台的武器\"又烂又贵\"。其中一例是台湾的节目主持人，时为国民党副总统候选人的赵少康，曾在去年底举办的政见会上，质疑台湾采购MQ-9B无人机买贵五倍，台湾国防部随后发布新闻稿澄清。且在台湾副总统政见会之前，台湾事实查核中心也已经针对网传\"买贵五倍\"的说法发布过查核报告。\n\n另一例是亚洲事实查核实验室今年初发布的 《台湾花大价钱从美国买F-16\"落伍战机\"，是\"冤大头\"？》，查核结果为\"错误\"。美国之音（VOA）\"揭谎频道\"、台湾事实查核中心等单位，也都曾针对不同军售案的传言进行查核。\n\n根据台湾资讯环境研究中心（IORG）报告，2021年8月拜登政府首次对台军售，便出现指控所购军备是\"废铁\"\"天价\"、军售是\"骗钱\"的论述。然而这些年来，相似剧本不断上演，这次无人机军售案也不例外。\n\n此外，对于这件无人机军售案，台湾国防部、外交部等单位表示欢迎与感谢，中国外交部则一贯反对，指控美国对台出售武器，严重违反一个中国原则和中美三个联合公报，特别是\"八一七公报\"规定。有关美国对台军售是否违反\"八一七公报\"，亚洲事实查核实验室也曾发布详细报告。\n\n亚洲事实查核实验室（Asia Fact Check Lab）针对当今复杂媒体环境以及新兴传播生态而成立。我们本于新闻专业主义，提供专业查核报告及与信息环境相关的传播观察、深度报道，帮助读者对公共议题获得多元而全面的认识。读者若对任何媒体及社交软件传播的信息有疑问，欢迎以电邮afcl@rfa.org寄给亚洲事实查核实验室，由我们为您查证核实。\n\n亚洲事实查核实验室在X、脸书、IG开张了，欢迎读者追踪、分享、转发。X这边请进：中文@asiafactcheckcn；英文：@AFCL_eng、FB在这里、IG也别忘了。",

        "summary": "In June, the U.S. government announced a $360 million arms sale to Taiwan, including two attack drone missile systems. This sparked controversy in Taiwan, with some commentators claiming the drones are overpriced and ineffective. These claims were widely circulated by media in both Taiwan and China.\n\nThe Asia Fact Check Lab (AFCL) investigated these claims by consulting U.S. State Department sources, military experts, and official documents. They found that the criticisms lacked evidence and were misleading. For instance, contrary to claims that no other countries wanted the \"Switchblade 300\" drones, France and another U.S. ally had purchased them.\n\nExperts like Richard Fisher and Tony Hu argued that these drones are suitable for Taiwan's defense needs, especially against potential Chinese military actions. The Taiwan Ministry of National Defense also defended the purchase, stating the drones are crucial for modern asymmetric warfare.\n\nThe AFCL noted that the cost of the drones includes additional components and services, making direct price comparisons misleading. This incident is part of a broader pattern of skepticism towards U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, often fueled by misinformation. The AFCL emphasized the importance of verifying such claims to avoid the spread of false information."

"旅居加拿大的前军官江林（看中国张小非摄）\n\n【看中国2024年7月3日讯】（看中国记者肖然采访报导）中共两任国防部长李尚福和魏凤和涉及腐败被开除出党，两起案件已移交军事检察官指控。前《解放军报》记者江林近日接受《看中国》采访时表示，中国军队如今已经腐败透顶，毫无战斗力。对于习近平是否会武力统一台湾，她也做出了预测。\n\n自去年夏天以来，中国国防机构进行了大规模清洗，上述两人是迄今为止被罢免的最大官员，此次清洗已导致十多名高级将领和军工企业高管下台。\n\n在中国国家主席习近平寻求增强中国武装力量、提高其战斗力和更积极地维护中国在该地区有争议的领土主张之际，中国人民解放军高层出现了动荡。\n\n在职业生涯的巅峰时期，前国防部长李尚福和魏凤和经常在世界顶级军事官员面前表现出强硬的语气。在连续举行的地区安全论坛上，这两位将军警告说，如果有人胆敢将自治的台湾从中国\"分裂\"出去，中国军队将\"不惜一切代价\"予以打击。他们还暗中向美国发出攻击，誓言要反击有争议的南海的\"霸权\"。\n\nCNN引述分析人士认为，这两位国防部长都是习近平提拔的，尽管中国领导人已经进行了十多年的反腐运动，但他们还是被免职，这凸显了军队最高层防止腐败的难度。\n\n新加坡拉惹勒南国际研究院研究员詹姆斯．查尔表示，尽管习近平的反腐运动取得了一些成功，但由于缺乏适当的民间监督和独立的司法体系，解放军只能依赖内部调查人员进行监督。他说，\"这很困难，所以腐败肯定会继续存在。\"\n\n为了实现习近平将解放军打造成\"世界一流\"战斗力量的宏伟目标，中国已投入数十亿美元购买和升级装备。习近平还组建了火箭军，这是一支精锐部队，负责管理中国快速扩张的核武库和弹道导弹库。\n\n去年被无故解职或失踪的将军大多与火箭军或军事装备有关，其中包括李尚福和魏凤和。\n\n在担任国防部长之前，李尚福担任解放军装备发展部部长五年。66岁的李尚福是一名工程师，在中国西南地区从事火箭和卫星发射工作数十年，后来被提拔到解放军总部负责军事装备采购。\n\n魏凤和今年70岁，是火箭军的首任司令员。2015年底，习近平将火箭军从解放军的前导弹部队第二炮兵提升为正式部队，魏凤和曾在第二炮兵部队工作数十年。魏凤和在火箭军的两位继任者也遭到清洗。\n\n中共中央政治局24名成员发布的声明中对李尚福的指控明确指出了武器采购中的腐败行为。\n\n据中央电视台消息称，除了收受贿赂和滥用职权外，李尚福还被指控\"严重污染军事装备行业的政治环境和行业行为\"。\n\n五角大楼资助的国防大学高级研究员乔尔．伍斯诺表示，这句措辞谨慎的措辞指出，制造武器的国有企业与解放军采购系统之间存在勾结。伍斯诺说：\"我们知道存在一些勾结，但不清楚关键武器是否真的不合格或不可靠，而且中共也不会承认这一点。\"\"如果事实属实，这对习近平来说将更加严重，因为他不仅会对遵纪守法产生怀疑，还会对实际的军事准备产生怀疑。\"\n\n记者：自去年夏天以来，习近平对国防机构进行大清洗，李尚福和魏凤和是迄今被罢免的最大官员，两人也与火箭军或军事装备有关。这次清洗已导致十多名高级将领和军工企业高管下台。作为前军官，你对此有什么看法？\n\n江林：他们都有共同性,包括对他们的审判的公布的那些罪行的言语,几乎都是一样的。\n\n他们所处的这个环境是一样的，他们都来自于军队，军队都是那样的传统、那样的制度，所以他们犯错误的原因都几乎一样。我觉得军队的高级干部和地方的那些高官的罪行也差不多。\n\n每个人都贪污受贿，不同的是数额不一样，现在几乎数额也都在一级了，越来越大。不是说通过习近平反腐，这个数额越来越少了，现在完全没有起到阻吓效果。比如某某贪污了几千万算什么呀，跟那个亿级比起来根本不算什么。贪污的数额越来越高，但共性都是一样，说明他们所处的土壤、这个制度根本没有改变。不仅没有改变，也没有任何改善。\n\n我觉得有意思的方面，说起他们的罪行都说他们背叛初心的什么的。判决出来以后，老百姓下面的跟帖都在说，他们官都当了这么大了还要贪污，这些人到底想做多大的官呀？还不能满足吗？我觉得这些人的疑问是有道理的，实际上你如果仔细的看他们的履历，了解他们产生罪恶的土壤，你就会发现不是从现在开始的，冰冻三尺非一日之寒。\n\n他们怎么去背叛初心呢？他们初心在什么时候开始改变的呢？\n\n我觉得绝对不是他们坐上国防部长的这个高位的时候，一般的人坐上这个高位，他们都认为已经是不错的了，梦寐以求终于走到这高位了，谁还会在这个高位上去触犯底线？就是从这个位置开始这种罪恶是比较少见的。尤其从军人来讲，都不是起自于这个高位，而是说他们过去就是就是这样的。\n\n我觉得他们初心的背叛，其实际上是来源于64，因为64的前后，我都在军队军报，我接触的这个面也很广，尤其我那个时候是做机动记者，所谓机动记者，就是负责采访这些高级干部和中央军委。中央军委有些什么活动，还有这些人的个人专访什么的，都是我们这几个记者在负责的。所以那个时候我们的观察，这些高级干部是非常还是很自律的。为什么呢？他们大部分都是文革以后平反昭雪的，他们很多人都是在文革的时候受到冲击，然后又重新到这个位置上，或者是提升到这个位置上的。那时候在这个位置上的这些高官，他们是不仅非常自律，有紧迫感，用那时候的话来说，抓紧生命的最后时刻，不要辜负党和人民的信任，要很好的去尽职尽责。\n\n那么这个64一开枪，就把整个军队的性质给改变了，原来是一个为人民服务的，是保护人民的，是消灭外来敌人的。这样的军队职能变成一个对内去镇压老百姓，去杀害那些无辜的平民，特别是杀害那些六四提出的口号反腐败反官到的学生。他们反对你们阵营里面和在当时弥漫在社会上的一种贪污腐化的风气。你们要镇压这些人，那么你们倡导的是什么？这是所有的人都看明白了，那就是好多正直的干部觉得就特别失望，就认为中国没有希望了，好不容易在经过改革开放，大家对中国的那点发展的那点信心，一下被这64开枪就给泯灭了。所以那时候在这些高级干部和这些军队干部弥漫末日风气，大家认为世界怎么这么黑暗，简直就是到了世界末日了，正义没有了，邪恶在闪烁，而且那个邪恶是最大的一种邪恶。你说什么邪恶能够达到杀人嗜血的这种邪恶？\n\n在这样的一种气氛的笼罩之下，大家认为那我们现在干嘛呀？然后大家都说，那我们就现在赶紧能捞就捞。好一点的干部就是得过且过。那些恶的人，那些靠杀人上位的这些人，就是江泽民讲闷声发大财。所谓的闷声发财，就是偷偷的发财，能贪就贪，能捞就捞。不就倡导这样吗？\n\n江泽民那时候集党政军三个最高职务于一身，中央军委主席、国家主席、党的总书记。他说我们要闷声发大财，给干部传达的是什么样的信息啊？\n\n那就是或许在采访、在工作的时候，你可以任意的收取好处费，而且没有好处你就不干，就是我要采访你，你要给我钱，你不给我钱，那咱们免谈，那不就是这样吗？\n\n所以那时候对所有所有部门，从军队开始的那种污染就是这样的，而且那个64的时候，进行了一个大清洗，军队的高级干部就是以64划线，如果你不拥护这个屠杀，认为64不正义的话，你就要离开这个岗位，或者受到处分，包括我这样的一个记者，我看到了真相，我要说出来了，那么不行，你要离开这个岗位，从上到下都是这样。所以在这种清洗之下，你说这些干部能干的是什么？这个杀人都不是事，都可以掩盖造假，而且是最后的一层道德底线都没有了，你贪两个钱那算什么呀？那贪污跟这杀人比起来，那不算什么吧？有好多人贪污完了以后，他还会去贿赂他的那些领导的，我也让你有钱，你能罩着我，我就给你送钱。当时我们的一些记者在议论事情，就说从64以后，就是贪污腐败会特大行其道，大家底线都没有了都去贪钱，上梁不正下梁歪，军委领导就像这两个人都官至国防部部长了，都是军委副主席最高的这个级别了，你都在就是大肆的敛财，你说下面的人他们会怎么样？所以那时候军队就是从上到下都在贪污，贪污到了什么程度？给每一层都开出一个价码来，包括最小的班长。学习江泽民闷声发大财，这些人就靠着这个，然后就一步一步一步的上去。\n\n那时候我记得就是习近平刚上台的时候，把军队的两个副主席，一个是郭伯雄，一个是徐财厚，给拿下来了。抄到郭伯雄的时候，他的地下室，有几箱子都是没有开，其中有一个好像是四川省军区的政委给他送了几十万，那个箱子里连开都没开，就是给拿下来了。那个箱子打开的时候，里面有一张纸，说某人就是我四川省军区的政委，我希望你可以把我提到什么样的职位，这是公开的拿钱买官，都到了这种程度，各级的官员都是有价码的。\n\n我的一个朋友，我们一直在一起工作的，他亲口跟我讲的，他说本来按照他的职务继续上升到一个位置上，但是这高级机关的干部部门去跟他谈话，说你现在表现不错，我们准备提拔你，但是有一条你要拿多少多少钱。他一听就很生气，他说你不要这样侮辱我，我这样一步一步能够走到这个位置，我不是拿钱买的这个位置，我是靠我自己能力到这个位置上来的，你让我拿多少多少钱，绝对不可以。那个干部门的人公开跟他说，如果你不拿这个钱，这一次你不但不能提，你还可能在这个位置就休息吧，你就退休了。结果他就是坚持没有拿这个钱，结果这个位置果然没有给他，他就退休了，这都是真事。听起来都觉得像听新闻似的，但是在现实的军队当中，高级干部的提拔就是这样的。\n\n前两天我看到中央党校的蔡霞教授在接受好像是美国知音的记者访问的时候，她说这个党是非常坏的党，这个干部任免制度，是一个掐尖的这样的一个体制。她说她也是引用中央党校的一个老教授的话，就说这个党不可救药，干部制度非常腐败是一个原因。\n\n改革开放以后曾经动了这个干部制度，胡耀邦要进行改革干部制度，就是要把有能力的人，特别是有能力的年轻干部，要破格提拔他们。胡耀邦当总书记的时候，贯彻了这一条的，当时很多的年轻干部脱颖而出。但是到了六四以后，整个政治体制改革全部都停止了，大踏步向后退，就又退到过去，就是毛的那个时期，就按照他们这个路线那个来划线，所谓的路线划线实际上就是以人划线。路线是个虚的，这个路线我说你合格就合格，我说你不合格就是不合格。\n\n到了64以后，又重新倒退回去，拥护我的，你就可以上去；不拥护我的，那你就下来。所以从江泽民开始，腐败越来越严重，就是江泽民死的时候，好多人还为他摇旗呐喊。\n\n虽然习近平上台以后，他也一直在反腐，但是外界评论说他习近平的这个反腐，最终的目的、真实的目的是为了清除异己，他并不是真正的反腐。\n\n其实党内的腐败非常严重的，甚至就是李尚福和魏凤和，是习近平一手亲自提拔上来的。魏凤和在2019年的时候，接受外媒自由亚洲电台的采访的时候，他提到64，他特别认为做的很对，没有64镇压，就没有30年的改革。军人的职责是对外的，所有国家的军队的职责都是这样的。但是到64，魏凤和他自己先背叛的初心，整个都变了。\n\n我觉得这两个国航部长他们在接受审判的时候，可能他们心里都不服，这个背叛初心不是从我们开始的，如果从你们背叛初心程度来说，我不过就是贪污点，我没杀人，我比你还强呢。所以即使那两个人得到了审判，他们从心里来说也不会是服气的，因为他们心里明白并不是最厉害的。\n\n记者：当了这么多年的解放军报记者，你是否觉得中国军队已经烂腐透顶了？\n\n江林：对！当然是腐烂腐烂透顶了。习近平上台的时候，为什么大家都拥护他？因为他是举着反腐的旗帜上台的，所以，这是大家拥护他的一个最重要的原因。就觉得终于有个领导能够祭起这个腐败的旗帜，整顿这个国家，整顿这个军队了。当时觉得他是一种希望，所以很多人都拥护他，包括我自己在内。\n\n但是看到了他不是反腐，他是靠这个清洗上位并巩固他自己的权位。他还去修宪，把邓小平当时改革的，让大家最拥护的一条，领导人不要搞终身制，就是说所有的人都看到了毛的错误，但是谁也拿他没有办法。那么解决这个问题的关键一定要改革干部制度，第一条就是你不要一个人在这个台上搞终身制。就是向西方学习搞任期制，有这么一个制度，到了8年了，你干的不好了，你就自动下台，因为制度在这摆着。\n\n但是习近平最要命的是把最根本的东西，这一条改成他要终生制、中心制。他不死他要做到底，党政军第一把手他一直都要站在这个位置上。\n\n所以从这一点来看，他反腐就是假的，他就是为了自己上位，就是要站稳自己的脚跟。所谓的什么党不变色，国家不变色，军队不变色，那都是幌子。你一个人就代表了这个党、这个军队、这个国家？谁信他的？所谓的那几顶皇冠，什么中国人民的儿子，什么党的优秀的党员啊，都要盖棺论，什么东西就是什么东西。\n\n最近习近平特别去延安，召开了一个军队的政治工作会议，强调枪杆子要掌握在忠诚的、可靠的人手中，强调政治治军这一点。你认为指的是什么？他未来还会继续的清洗军队？\n\n我给你说就是我的老领导,我刚开始新闻工作的时候的老领导,他跟我说,你看人民日报,看共产党的报纸,你要反着看。什么叫反着看？就是他说什么强调什么的时候，那肯定是那个方面出问题了。比如他说党的关键时刻，什么国家的关键时刻，就是这个时候出问题了，他在国际上的威信也好，在党的微信上也好，在国家的微信上也好都出问题了，就是大家都在怀疑他，都在反对他。而且这是一个事实。\n\n如在香港的问题上，什么50年不变，你把香港安了一个国安法，现在香港的所有的法律都以国安法划线。你背叛你自己当初制定的跟英国签订的中英联合声明，公开违反国际法。然后对内在新疆你搞那种种族灭绝。在俄乌战争问题上，你又公开的站在俄方。\n\n台湾我让回归，要统一你。你不同意，尤其是民进党非常的明确提出来，我们实际从历史上就是互不隶属，我从来就没有隶属过你。从蔡英文开始到新的总统赖清德都是非常清楚的。所以他就很恼火，你不听我的话，那么我就要打你，用武力来来所谓的解放你。这是他的逻辑。\n\n记者：这样会不会很矛盾呢？一方面军队如此的腐败，都是买官卖官，还有什么战斗力。另一方面，习近平口口声声的说要武统台湾。到底他是想打，还是他自己也知道军队现在如此虚弱？\n\n江林：极权国家的领导人的思维不是正常人的思维。举个例子，第一次海湾战争的时候，萨达姆他想当阿拉伯之王，他怎么样当这个王呢？他就要跟美国打仗来说明自己，在这个战争当中立他这个王。这个和习近平很像。\n\n那时他的宣传部长，美国军队一直都开到他那屋里了，他还在说我们是战无不胜的。这些人临死他都不会嘴软，都要打口炮。习近平也是这样，他明明知道他自己的实力不能跟美国干一仗，但是他觉得他干台湾没有问题，就跟普京当初想他干乌克兰没有问题似的。普京在打这一仗的时候，他从来没有想到过乌克兰会反抗，而且会这么顽强的反抗，另外国际上56个国家支持乌克兰提供武器。他觉得两个小时就能解决问题。习近平不是也是这样吗？那些军头也玩命喊，我们两个小时就可以到台北喝茶了，都是非常狂妄。\n\n记者：习近平也亲眼看见俄乌战争僵持了这么久，到现在还没打下来，普京主动的去朝鲜求援。习近平他看到这一点，俄罗斯这么强大国家打乌克兰打得这么艰难，他会不会还是对此还是有所忌惮？对国际社会的制裁各方面有所忌惮？你怎么看这个问题？\n\n江林：从他的本质这一点来观察这个问题，前一段他对欧盟的主席冯德莱恩说，打台湾完全是美国的诱惑，诱骗我们去打台湾，我才不上他这个当。\n\n他为什么跟冯德莱恩说这个事呢？就是他在查两个军头，两任国防部长，然后发现这军队根本打不了仗，所以他要解放军打仗这是不可以的。\n\n这是回答他为什么在延安开会，强调军队在政治上要听党的，枪杆子要掌握在党的手里，你要坚决听我的话，不能背叛我。实际上也是说明他在这个问题上出问题了，而且是出了大问题了。所以火箭军从上到下整个的领导班子一窝端了。因为他要打台湾，首先就要靠火箭军，靠导弹打过去，他发现火箭军不行了。所以他把这整个的班子都给换掉了。可想而知他这个问题有多大。小道消息说他在准备这个战争的时候，发现火箭军连那个导弹发射井的井盖都打不开，井盖锈到一块去了。你想这问题多严重啊。这个军队干部都怎么上来的呀？就靠效忠，那个井盖锈不锈跟我没关系，干部谁去负责任啊？谁去带这个兵去啊？\n\n我父母都是住干休所的，有一次我去干休所跟司机聊天，那个小战士告诉我，这个车队好多人都不止开一辆车，开好多车，我们在车队开自己的车，他说我们都有自己的车。这个兵都是开着自己的车来当兵的，肯定这个兵家是有钱的，带着车来进北京，车上不得多装点钱呀。那些土大款让自己孩子当兵是为什么？他们觉得自己的孩子如果要有出息的话，在部队里混个一官半职，那样下面的人都不敢欺负你。送到野战军太辛苦了，把我儿子就累坏了怎么办，让我儿子当一个舒服一点的兵。那就是给首长开车的就比较舒服，不需要出操、摸爬滚打，练单兵技术，只要给首长开好车就行，怎么样能把这个首长伺候好，或把你的车开过去给他服务。\n\n因为后来有一些纪律，习近平上台以后，就是军车不能到处跑。比如军车开在歌厅、豪华饭店、豪华宾馆前面，然后被曝光说军队怎么怎么腐败。所以有一条纪律，军车都不能够开到那些地方去。所以这些兵就开着自己的车，叔叔阿姨你们要去哪，我可以带你们去，但是条件就是你们要给我说点好话，因为这些干休所都是高级军官，说话还是有用的呀。他叫志愿兵，那个时代都在6,000块钱以上，比当干部的，当排长的钱还要多一点。所以这些人通过这个方式，可以拿到很高的工资，尤其能留在部队的高级机关。所以这个都是腐败，兵都腐败到这种程度。而且再一条就是在这个体制里面，你想不腐败都不行。\n\n为什么不行呢？我也给你讲几个例子，你到了这个位置，你不要这个钱，这钱就给你送来了，你想不要都不行。所以你说一个用钱搞定的军队，他有战斗力吗？\n\n现在习近平他心知肚明，他其实非常清楚现在这个军队所谓的忠诚于党都成了一口号了，其实这也说明他没招了，回天无力了。\n\n你只要在这个党里待着，你只要在这个位置上，你都可以得到钱，就是这个制度当官的捷径，所以每一个干部被被拔下，被挖出来的时候，都是同一个罪行，魏凤和也好，李尚福也好，他们两个人都不在一个兵种，而且他们是两任的国防部长，但是他们为什么能够犯同样的错误，就是产生这个罪恶的体制和制度，决定了这些人就是这个样子。这个制度不改变，这些人避免不了。因为你这个体制是这样的，政治体制一点都没有变，整个干部晋升制度根本就没有改变。\n\n所以他这反腐反的什么，反腐的成效在什么地方？在这样的一个体制之下，各级军队战斗力在什么地方？现在就剩钱了，非常的可怕。\n\n你要统一，你那还不如别人，你要用你的劣质一人家那个优质可能吗？所以他要打仗和他能不能打仗完全是两回事。他现在没招了，所以就是在延安去开会，然后他要往回走。我觉得如果是但凡是一个军人，稍微正常一点，坐在延安的礼堂里面，开这样的一个会，听这样的一些话，有几个能觉得这样做真的能解决问题的。\n\n记者：最近中国多个省出现了一个叫\"警税合作作战中心\"，叫\"作战中心\"是不是把纳税人当成敌人了？\n\n江林：我真的觉得中国的那个荒谬，真的是越来越不像一个国家，所以什么乱七八糟的东西都提出来了，我就觉得他起码是他没钱了。你的纳税制度怎么不能解决这个问题，你还要去做什么战呢？你把这些企业家都当成敌人，那谁还敢跟你玩啊。\n\n你不但把外资吓跑，你也把自己人都吓跑了。凡是能在中国挣钱的人，一看到你这个作战都吓坏了，都得赶紧跑，再跑来不及了。他跟谁作战，他收税管谁收税？现在是倒查30年，所谓的作战部门要解决税的问题，所以你说那些人不跑还更待何时。\n\n记者\"肖然\n\n来源:看中国

The article also touches on the large-scale purge within China's defense institutions since last summer, resulting in the removal of over a dozen senior military officials and defense industry executives. Despite President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, the military continues to struggle with corruption due to the lack of civilian oversight and an independent judiciary.

什么中国人民的儿子，什么党的优秀的党员啊，都要盖棺论，什么东西就是什么东西。\n\n最近习近平特别去延安，召开了一个军队的政治工作会议，强调枪杆子要掌握在忠诚的、可靠的人手中，强调政治治军这一点。你认为指的是什么？他未来还会继续的清洗军队？\n\n我给你说就是我的老领导,我刚开始新闻工作的时候的老领导,他跟我说,你看人民日报,看共产党的报纸,你要反着看。什么叫反着看？就是他说什么强调什么的时候，那肯定是那个方面出问题了。比如他说党的关键时刻，什么国家的关键时刻，就是这个时候出问题了，他在国际上的威信也好，在党的微信上也好，在国家的微信上也好都出问题了，就是大家都在怀疑他，都在反对他。而且这是一个事实。\n\n如在香港的问题上，什么50年不变，你把香港安了一个国安法，现在香港的所有的法律都以国安法划线。你背叛你自己当初制定的跟英国签订的中英联合声明，公开违反国际法。然后对内在新疆你搞那种种族灭绝。在俄乌战争问题上，你又公开的站在俄方。\n\n台湾我让回归，要统一你。你不同意，尤其是民进党非常的明确提出来，我们实际从历史上就是互不隶属，我从来就没有隶属过你。从蔡英文开始到新的总统赖清德都是非常清楚的。所以他就很恼火，你不听我的话，那么我就要打你，用武力来来所谓的解放你。这是他的逻辑。\n\n记者：这样会不会很矛盾呢？一方面军队如此的腐败，都是买官卖官，还有什么战斗力。另一方面，习近平口口声声的说要武统台湾。到底他是想打，还是他自己也知道军队现在如此虚弱？\n\n江林：极权国家的领导人的思维不是正常人的思维。举个例子，第一次海湾战争的时候，萨达姆他想当阿拉伯之王，他怎么样当这个王呢？他就要跟美国打仗来说明自己，在这个战争当中立他这个王。这个和习近平很像。\n\n那时他的宣传部长，美国军队一直都开到他那屋里了，他还在说我们是战无不胜的。这些人临死他都不会嘴软，都要打口炮。习近平也是这样，他明明知道他自己的实力不能跟美国干一仗，但是他觉得他干台湾没有问题，就跟普京当初想他干乌克兰没有问题似的。普京在打这一仗的时候，他从来没有想到过乌克兰会反抗，而且会这么顽强的反抗，另外国际上56个国家支持乌克兰提供武器。他觉得两个小时就能解决问题。习近平不是也是这样吗？那些军头也玩命喊，我们两个小时就可以到台北喝茶了，都是非常狂妄。\n\n记者：习近平也亲眼看见俄乌战争僵持了这么久，到现在还没打下来，普京主动的去朝鲜求援。习近平他看到这一点，俄罗斯这么强大国家打乌克兰打得这么艰难，他会不会还是对此还是有所忌惮？对国际社会的制裁各方面有所忌惮？你怎么看这个问题？\n\n江林：从他的本质这一点来观察这个问题，前一段他对欧盟的主席冯德莱恩说，打台湾完全是美国的诱惑，诱骗我们去打台湾，我才不上他这个当。\n\n他为什么跟冯德莱恩说这个事呢？就是他在查两个军头，两任国防部长，然后发现这军队根本打不了仗，所以他要解放军打仗这是不可以的。\n\n这是回答他为什么在延安开会，强调军队在政治上要听党的，枪杆子要掌握在党的手里，你要坚决听我的话，不能背叛我。实际上也是说明他在这个问题上出问题了，而且是出了大问题了。所以火箭军从上到下整个的领导班子一窝端了。因为他要打台湾，首先就要靠火箭军，靠导弹打过去，他发现火箭军不行了。所以他把这整个的班子都给换掉了。可想而知他这个问题有多大。小道消息说他在准备这个战争的时候，发现火箭军连那个导弹发射井的井盖都打不开，井盖锈到一块去了。你想这问题多严重啊。这个军队干部都怎么上来的呀？就靠效忠，那个井盖锈不锈跟我没关系，干部谁去负责任啊？谁去带这个兵去啊？\n\n我父母都是住干休所的，有一次我去干休所跟司机聊天，那个小战士告诉我，这个车队好多人都不止开一辆车，开好多车，我们在车队开自己的车，他说我们都有自己的车。这个兵都是开着自己的车来当兵的，肯定这个兵家是有钱的，带着车来进北京，车上不得多装点钱呀。那些土大款让自己孩子当兵是为什么？他们觉得自己的孩子如果要有出息的话，在部队里混个一官半职，那样下面的人都不敢欺负你。送到野战军太辛苦了，把我儿子就累坏了怎么办，让我儿子当一个舒服一点的兵。那就是给首长开车的就比较舒服，不需要出操、摸爬滚打，练单兵技术，只要给首长开好车就行，怎么样能把这个首长伺候好，或把你的车开过去给他服务。\n\n因为后来有一些纪律，习近平上台以后，就是军车不能到处跑。比如军车开在歌厅、豪华饭店、豪华宾馆前面，然后被曝光说军队怎么怎么腐败。所以有一条纪律，军车都不能够开到那些地方去。所以这些兵就开着自己的车，叔叔阿姨你们要去哪，我可以带你们去，但是条件就是你们要给我说点好话，因为这些干休所都是高级军官，说话还是有用的呀。他叫志愿兵，那个时代都在6,000块钱以上，比当干部的，当排长的钱还要多一点。所以这些人通过这个方式，可以拿到很高的工资，尤其能留在部队的高级机关。所以这个都是腐败，兵都腐败到这种程度。而且再一条就是在这个体制里面，你想不腐败都不行。\n\n为什么不行呢？我也给你讲几个例子，你到了这个位置，你不要这个钱，这钱就给你送来了，你想不要都不行。所以你说一个用钱搞定的军队，他有战斗力吗？\n\n现在习近平他心知肚明，他其实非常清楚现在这个军队所谓的忠诚于党都成了一口号了，其实这也说明他没招了，回天无力了。\n\n你只要在这个党里待着，你只要在这个位置上，你都可以得到钱，就是这个制度当官的捷径，所以每一个干部被被拔下，被挖出来的时候，都是同一个罪行，魏凤和也好，李尚福也好，他们两个人都不在一个兵种，而且他们是两任的国防部长，但是他们为什么能够犯同样的错误，就是产生这个罪恶的体制和制度，决定了这些人就是这个样子。这个制度不改变，这些人避免不了。因为你这个体制是这样的，政治体制一点都没有变，整个干部晋升制度根本就没有改变。\n\n所以他这反腐反的什么，反腐的成效在什么地方？在这样的一个体制之下，各级军队战斗力在什么地方？现在就剩钱了，非常的可怕。\n\n你要统一，你那还不如别人，你要用你的劣质一人家那个优质可能吗？所以他要打仗和他能不能打仗完全是两回事。他现在没招了，所以就是在延安去开会，然后他要往回走。我觉得如果是但凡是一个军人，稍微正常一点，坐在延安的礼堂里面，开这样的一个会，听这样的一些话，有几个能觉得这样做真的能解决问题的。\n\n记者：最近中国多个省出现了一个叫\"警税合作作战中心\"，叫\"作战中心\"是不是把纳税人当成敌人了？\n\n江林：我真的觉得中国的那个荒谬，真的是越来越不像一个国家，所以什么乱七八糟的东西都提出来了，我就觉得他起码是他没钱了。你的纳税制度怎么不能解决这个问题，你还要去做什么战呢？你把这些企业家都当成敌人，那谁还敢跟你玩啊。\n\n你不但把外资吓跑，你也把自己人都吓跑了。凡是能在中国挣钱的人，一看到你这个作战都吓坏了，都得赶紧跑，再跑来不及了。他跟谁作战，他收税管谁收税？现在是倒查30年，所谓的作战部门要解决税的问题，所以你说那些人不跑还更待何时。\n\n欢迎给您喜欢的作者捐助。您的爱心鼓励就是对我们媒体的耕耘。\n\n来源:看中国\n\n短网址:

        "summary": "The news article discusses the severe corruption within the Chinese military, as highlighted by former officer Jiang Lin, now residing in Canada. Two former Chinese Defense Ministers, Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe, have been expelled from the Communist Party due to corruption charges, which have been handed over to military prosecutors. This is part of a broader purge within China's defense institutions since last summer, resulting in the removal of over a dozen senior military officials and defense industry executives.\n\nJiang Lin, a former journalist for the PLA Daily, asserts that the Chinese military is deeply corrupt and lacks combat effectiveness. Despite President Xi Jinping's efforts to strengthen the military and assert China's territorial claims, the top echelons of the PLA are in turmoil. Analysts suggest that the ongoing corruption, despite Xi's anti-corruption campaign, underscores the difficulty of eradicating corruption without proper civilian oversight and an independent judiciary.\n\nThe article also touches on the implications of this corruption for China's military ambitions, particularly regarding Taiwan. Jiang Lin predicts that Xi might hesitate to use force against Taiwan due to the military's compromised state. The article concludes with a discussion on the broader societal impact of corruption and the erosion of trust in the Chinese government and military."

        "body": "上海合作组织（SCO）7月3日将在哈萨克斯坦首都阿斯塔纳举行第24届元首理事会会议。引人注目的是印度总理莫迪决定不出席此次上合组织峰会，改由外长苏杰生代表他与会。\n\n莫迪将于7月8日至9日对俄罗斯进行访问，并将与普京举行双边峰会。莫迪访问俄罗斯之后，据信还将于7月9日前往奥地利进行为期2天的访问。\n\n《印度教徒报》表示，莫迪之所以缺席上合组织峰会是因为他需要为出访俄罗斯和奥地利做准备，但是印度官方尚未就莫迪的两国之行做任何的正式宣布。\n\n《印度教徒报》说，此次上合组织峰会预计将聚焦地区安全局势以及如何提升成员国之间的联系和贸易。峰会将讨论阿富汗局势、乌克兰战争以及如何提升成员国之间的安全合作。\n\n\"出席上合组织峰会的印度代表团将由外交部长苏杰生率领，\"印度外交部发言人兰德希尔·贾斯瓦尔（Randhir Jaiswal）在上周五举行的记者会上宣布。\n\n据《今日印度》报道，莫迪原先已经证实将出席此次峰会，并且已经开始启动安全措施。但是后来在做了进一步评估后改变了主意。\n\n成立于1996年的上合组织目前拥有九个正式成员国，除了中国、俄罗斯和印度外，还有哈萨克斯坦、吉尔吉斯斯坦、塔吉克斯坦、乌兹别克、巴基斯坦和伊朗。该组织还有蒙古、白俄罗斯和塔利班三个观察员和13个对话伙伴。\n\n俄罗斯支持白俄罗斯加入上合组织，白俄罗斯预计将成为第10个正式会员国。\n\n印度总理通常都会出席上合组织峰会。莫迪此次虽然不能与会，却在星期二（2日）与哈萨克斯坦总统托卡耶夫通了电话，对哈萨克斯坦此次成功举办上合组织峰会表示完全的支持。\n\n【图：莫迪不久前刚刚接待了美国总统国家安全顾问沙利文】\n\n至于莫迪缺席峰会的原因，印方放出的消息是日程安排与国内议会有冲突。虽然这个理由从表面来看也勉强说得过去。但我们也知道，实际情况肯定是没有这么简单的。\n\n从目前来看，莫迪的缺席确实会对上合组织造成一定影响。再怎么说，印度都是大国，莫迪的缺席对本次上合峰会以及组织之后的工作，不会是好事。\n\n分析认为，最关键的一点，即印度并不想彻底和中俄站在同一条战线上。其所希望的是利用这种在中俄与西方之间，巧妙维持平衡的办法，有效为其更大的发展空间和积极权。\n\n俄乌战争爆发后，印度无视美西方制裁，加大同俄方的能源合作；但同时，印度也想加大西方国家的往来力度，吸引西方对印投资，并且通过加大国防和军事合作，实现对中国的制衡。",

        "title": "美国为何要与中国竞争？布林肯道出原因：仅美有资格塑造全球未来_手机网易网",
        "body": "根据法媒报道，当地时间7月1日，美国国务卿布林肯在华盛顿参加由布鲁金斯学会主办的美国外交政策对话会，在会上，布林肯就30多次提到中国，妄称中国希望成为国际体系中的主导国家，但中国对未来的愿景与全球其他国家不同，因此美国要挺身而出，和中国\"激烈竞争\"，确保美国才是真正塑造未来的国家。\n\n这话说得很文绉绉的，翻译成大白话其实就只有一句，西方国家不愿看到中国的崛起，因此美国将代表全世界挺身而出，遏制中国的崛起。\n\n为了论证自身的观点，布林肯还特别谈到俄乌战争，他说中国对俄罗斯的\"支持\"，是俄罗斯能够继续发展本国国防工业，维持高强度战争的关键原因，中国正扮演着\"推波助澜的角色\"。\n\n但是按照布林肯的逻辑来说，如果中国发展俄罗斯的外交关系，推动中俄双边贸易就是对俄罗斯的支持的话。那么美国推动北约东扩，导致俄罗斯地缘安全利益受损最终引发这场俄乌战争，那是不是意味着美国才是全球安全的最不稳定因素呢？所以，布林肯的这番表态，本质上就是以己之矛攻己之盾。\n\n除此之外，还有两个最大的问题，那就是美国能不能代表全世界，美国对未来的愿景是否与其他国家相符？\n\n这个答案用脚趾头都能想得明白。西方国家一共只有22个，组成了以美国为核心的西方体系，即便是在统一体系下，有的国家比如法国，一直和美国不太对付，布林肯如何用西方体系代表全球国家，难不成在布林肯的眼中，西方国家就是全世界，其他更广大的国家只是附庸，代表不了世界？\n\n除此之外，从全球范围来看，美国是否真的代表了全球国家的利益？这个答案显然也是否定的。二战后，美国的发家史本质上就是一部全球战争压迫史，均是以从自身利益出发，对全球秩序进行构建，而这对应的就是对其他国家的压迫和掠夺，共赢一词，在美国看来就是自己要赢两次。\n\n二战后，美国在全球范围内打入了三根楔子。分别是欧洲、中东以及东亚。\n\n美国在欧洲打入的一根楔子就是英国，因为英国的大陆均势政策与美国的欧洲利益相似，目的就是搅乱欧洲，避免出现一个统一的欧洲。加上美国推动马歇尔计划，推动欧洲经济的快速发展，逐渐拿到了欧洲的舆论控制，具体来说就是美国思想、影视文化在欧洲大行其道，从而构建了一整套所谓的\"普世价值\"的东西，再利用苏联的战略安全威胁，从而成功将欧洲绑上了战车，并以此作为自己的基本盘在全球范围内\"开疆拓土\"。现在的欧洲依然缺乏\"独立自主\"的能力，这也是法国总和美国唱反调的原因，因为法国希望建立一个\"独立自主\"的欧盟。\n\n在东亚也是如此，日本和英国相似，同样是一个离岛国家。只不过战败国的身份导致日本难以有所作为，所以就成了美国介入东亚问题的一块跳板，手不仅仅伸向了南海、台海、蒙古，同时还把手伸到了东南亚，恨不得把西太平洋搅得天翻地覆。\n\n而在中东地区并不存在\"离岛\"，既然没有地理意义上的离岛，那就建立一个政治意义的离岛，以色列应运而生，从此之后阿拉伯国家与以色列的斗争不死不休，五次中东战争直接导致中东再也无力抵挡美国的强大攻势。同时美国还利用什叶派和逊尼派之间的矛盾冲突，瓦解中东国家之间的团结，为美国称霸中东提供内部条件。\n\n在美国主导这一全球地缘政治格局中，不少国家日子过得可以说是每况愈下，战争与冲突在世界范围内此起彼伏，从而有一日停歇，苏联解体后有海湾战争，伊拉克战争、阿富汗战争，最近还有叙利亚战争、以及正在进行的巴以冲突和俄乌战争。\n\n除此之外，中东地区爆发的阿拉伯之春、中亚也有橙色革命、 以及各种代理人战争，甚至美国还和ISIS、库尔德等组织有着各种密切的联系，难不成美国所主导的世界，就应该是这个样子？\n\n另外美国所主导的美元霸权，以控制全球贸易货币为手段，推动美元潮汐，通过货币的流动对全球国家进行收割。\n\n从以上种种，美国所主导的全球秩序，根本不是一个符合绝大部分国家利益的良好秩序，用一句话来说就是\"天下苦美久矣\"。\n\n所以说，布林肯口中的要为全球国家挺身而出，本身就是一个伪命题，美国除了能代表自己外，甚至连西方世界都无法完全代表，又何来的代表全世界？更别说布林肯表示要保证美国才是塑造未来的国家，这话恐怕全球90%以上的国家都不会赞同。因为有句话说得好：美国塑造过战争，饥饿，疾病，死亡，就是没塑造过全人类的美好未来。",

        "summary": "On July 1, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke at a foreign policy forum in Washington, hosted by the Brookings Institution. Blinken mentioned China over 30 times, asserting that China aims to dominate the international system with a vision different from other countries. He argued that the U.S. must engage in \"fierce competition\" with China to ensure it is the U.S. that shapes the future.\n\nBlinken also linked China's support for Russia to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, suggesting that China's actions enable Russia to sustain its defense industry and high-intensity conflict. This stance was criticized as hypocritical, given the U.S.'s role in NATO expansion, which has been seen as a factor in the war.\n\nThe article questions whether the U.S. can truly represent global interests, noting that the Western bloc led by the U.S. comprises only 22 countries, and even within this group, there are disagreements, such as between the U.S. and France. It argues that the U.S. has historically pursued its own interests at the expense of global stability, citing its influence in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East, and its role in various conflicts and economic policies.\n\nThe article concludes that Blinken's claim that the U.S. represents global interests is a fallacy, as the U.S. has often acted in ways that benefit itself rather than the global community."

        "title": "俄罗斯没有其他选择，翻倍进口中国先进设备，为军工业博个机会_手机网易网",
        "body": "俄罗斯作为前苏联的一员，在苏联解体后继承了大量军工遗产，可以说是不折不扣的军工大国。\n\n不过，武器储备再多也禁不住战争消耗，随着时间的推移，俄罗斯在军工方面暴露的短板越来越多。尤其在美欧各种出口管制下，俄罗斯军工业发展寸步难行。\n\n为了摆脱出口管制困局，俄罗斯选择了加深与中国的合作，为军工业博个机会。俄罗斯军工业为何面临困局？为何要加深与中国合作？\n\n俄罗斯的困境\n\n事实上，很多人都会有个疑问，继承了前苏联的大部分\"遗产\"的俄罗斯军工业，发展了几十年怎么反而一落千丈呢？\n\n提起来苏联，大家自然而然就会联想到\"钢铁洪流\"，1981年苏联组织的\"西方-81\"军事演习，漫山遍野的重型坦克刷新了全球国家的认知。\n\n我国深刻意识到实力的重要性，开始埋着头搞研发，北约成员国更是被吓破了胆。\n\n当时美国总统直接表态：\"如果这时苏联向美国发起进攻，美国将毫无抵抗之力。\"\n\n二十世纪八十年代，苏联的钢铁产量达到了1.48亿吨，超过美国43%，坦克年产量已经达到了2000辆以上，平均仅需7小时就可以造出一枚导弹。\n\n完善的军工产业就像一台精密的机器，不断生产着各类装备，给苏联套上了一层坚不可摧的外壳。\n\n但是随着苏联的解体，原本庞大且完善的军工体系只能被拆分，俄罗斯虽然继承到了70%左右的军工业，但这个体系是残缺的，残缺的军工体系和没有几乎没什么区别。\n\n再加上苏联解体时原本就乱成了一团麻，经济惨不忍睹。俄罗斯政府实行\"休克疗法\"，想要拯救不断下滑的经济，没想到毫无效果，经济直接跌入谷底。\n\n残缺的军工体系再加上没有资金搞研发，如此天崩般的开局，俄罗斯想要发展军工也是有心无力，于是俄罗斯军工的发展就偏向了\"考古式\"研究。\n\n从久久未决的俄乌战争可以看出来，俄罗斯所用的装备还是几十年前的产物，如KH-22空地导弹。\n\n即使这样产能也完全跟不上需求，由于缺乏武器，俄罗斯不得不将价格不菲的S-300防空导弹当远程火箭弹用。\n\n除此之外，俄罗斯生产的炮弹还遭到炮兵部队的控诉，称炮弹误差大，质量有问题，这意味着什么？\n\n意味着现有的生产设备已经完全不能满足需求，数控机床需要更新换代了。此前，俄罗斯进口机床的主要来源国是德国、日本等国家。\n\n俄乌战争爆发后，美国宣布在国防、航空航天、工业等领域对俄罗斯实行\"最全面的出口管制\"，限制俄罗斯的进出口贸易，也就是说俄罗斯将面临着有钱也没有地方买的状况。\n\n一方面是国内沉疴宿疾的军工业，一方面是美欧各种出口管制，俄罗斯该如何破局呢？\n\n中国是解局关键\n\n科学技术是第一生产力，唯有不断发展高新技术产业，才能使国家发展形成良性循环。\n\n俄罗斯的经济贸易结构以能源出口为主，在工业和科技创新方面是比较薄弱的，高科技产品高度依赖进口。\n\n根据研究数据显示，俄罗斯每年的高科技产品进口贸易额在190亿美元左右，其中45%来自欧盟，21%来自美国，11%来自中国。\n\n从数据可以直观看到，美欧为首的全面制裁对俄罗斯还是存在不小影响的。不过这也并非是一盘死棋，中国便是俄罗斯突破封锁的关键，俄罗斯也将所有的宝都压在了中国身上。\n\n根据俄罗斯媒体的报道，如今俄企正在逐步用中国产品替代\"不友好国家\"的产品。目前在设备市场上，有七成左右的俄罗斯企业选择\"中国制造\"，并且未来这个占比还会更高。\n\n盖达尔经济研究所针对1000所俄罗斯企业开展了调查问卷，结果显示中国已经成为俄企最受欢迎的新渠道。\n\n从2022年开始，中俄贸易额持续增长，光是2022年一年，中国对俄罗斯出口总额同比增长12.8%，高达716亿美元，并且还在不断扩大贸易种类，增加了挖掘机、山地车、装载机、起重机等，甚至还有数控机床。\n\n面对美欧对数控机床的出口管制，俄罗斯并没有选择妥协，而是扭头寻找中国合作。\n\n根据英国《金融时报》的报道，俄乌冲突爆发后，中俄数控机床的贸易额暴涨10倍，从冲突前的650万美元左右涨到了6800万美元。\n\n2023年底，俄国防部长绍伊古在对特别军事行动进行总结时表示，如今俄罗斯军工产业的产量正在稳步提升，炮弹产能增加了17.5倍，完全不会出现炮弹打完的情况。\n\n可以看出，中俄深度合作带来的是双赢的结果，俄罗斯能源多，工业基础薄弱，缺少各类技术设备；而我国缺少能源，并且作为全球唯一一个全产业链的国家，能够完美满足俄罗斯的需求。\n\n美欧等国退出俄罗斯数控机床市场，为我国数控机床走出去提供了一个绝佳的机会。\n\n我国工业发展晚，数控机床技术起步同样也慢一步，哪怕现在数控机床技术已经达到市场需求，但也很难在已经固定的市场上分一块蛋糕。\n\n如今美欧主动退出，留出一个空位置，我们自然要把握机会，填补俄罗斯市场的空缺。\n\n随着中俄不断加深合作，会给双方共同带来新的发展和机遇，实现双赢。",

        "summary": "Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia inherited a significant portion of its military-industrial complex but has struggled to maintain and advance it due to economic challenges and export controls from the US and Europe. To overcome these obstacles, Russia has increasingly turned to China for advanced equipment and technology. \n\nKey points:\n1. **Historical Context**: Russia inherited a substantial but incomplete military-industrial system from the Soviet Union, which has deteriorated over time due to economic difficulties and lack of investment.\n2. **Current Challenges**: The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has highlighted deficiencies in Russia's military capabilities, including outdated equipment and insufficient production capacity.\n3. **Export Controls**: US and European export controls have severely restricted Russia's ability to import high-tech equipment, particularly CNC machines, which are crucial for modern military production.\n4. **China's Role**: In response, Russia has significantly increased its imports of Chinese advanced equipment. Chinese products are replacing those from \"unfriendly countries,\" with around 70% of Russian enterprises now opting for Chinese-made equipment.\n5. **Economic Data**: Trade between China and Russia has surged, with a notable increase in the export of machinery and high-tech products from China to Russia. For instance, the trade in CNC machines between the two countries has increased tenfold since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began.\n6. **Mutual Benefits**: This deepening cooperation is mutually beneficial. Russia gains access to essential technology and equipment, while China secures a significant market for its products, especially in the face of Western sanctions.\n\nThe collaboration between Russia and China is expected to continue growing, providing both nations with new opportunities and reinforcing their economic and strategic partnership."

        "body": "中国和菲律宾在南中国海情势紧张。菲媒6月30日报道，菲律宾参谋总长表示，一旦战争爆发，不论是菲律宾或其他大国都是输家。专家认为，尽管该区域局势紧张，引发全面战争的可能性并不高。\n\n双方重点均为发展经济 将寻求协商与谈判解决问题\n\n中国与菲律宾近来屡在南中国海仁爱暗沙附近爆发冲突，被形容为恐发生战争的热点之一。根据菲律宾军方上周公布的一段影片显示，中国海警和菲律宾军方船只在6月17号发生激烈冲撞。双方互相指责是挑起争端的一方。马尼拉指责中国船只冲撞菲律宾船只，并且\"登船抢夺武器\"；中方则反指菲律宾船只故意危险接近中方正常航行船只。\n\n菲律宾军队参谋总长布劳纳（Romeo Brawner）6月29日表示，国家面临挑战，有必要加强后备力量，\"为任何可能发生的情况做好准备\"，但他否认媒体报导指这些秀肌肉动作是为应对与中国加剧的敌对行动所做的准备。他指出，马尼拉正在尽一切努力避免战争。\n\n布劳纳表示，菲律宾总统小马科斯已指示\"用尽一切可能措施和行动以防止战争\"，但命令菲律宾武装部队要确保菲国在专属经济区（EEZ）得以维护主权，菲方将遵循国际法，并促进基于国际规则的秩序。\n\n在菲律宾的地缘政治分析师兼菲律宾－中东研究协会（PMESA）南亚及东南亚研究主任唐·麦克莱恩·吉尔(Don McLain Gill)认为，中国持续引起海域冲突之目有几项。他向美国之音指出，中国正在试图透过挑战马尼拉维护主权的决心，并不断测试菲国与盟友之间的合作，以此迫使菲律宾屈服于北京，让出菲国在西菲律宾海的利益。他表示，中国很可能会将 6 月 17 日的挑衅行为常态化，中菲将陷入僵局。\n\n印太军事专家，台湾开南大学国家与区域发展研究中心主任陈文甲在接受美国之音采访时表示，中菲两国在主权争议上向来不愿意轻易让步，因为中菲的纷争涉及国家主权、民族自尊、战略利益以及经济资源等。他认为，毕竟中菲两国都需要维持稳定的经济发展，战争会对双方经济造成严重打击，因此尽管最近南中国海局势紧张，引发全面战争的可能性相对较低。\n\n陈文甲说:\"中国作为全球第二大经济体，不愿因战争而破坏其经济发展大局。而菲律宾则在军事上处于劣势，不愿冒险挑起大规模战争。\"\n\n陈文甲认为，近期的冲突将会让中菲双方更坚定各自的立场，增加谈判的难度。\n\n台湾国际战略学会信赖研究中心主任黄惠华指出，基于《南中国海各方行为宣言》（Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea），既然中国与东盟均承诺使用公认的国际法原则管理国家间关系，还是会设法以和平方式解决争端。\n\n她告诉美国之音:\"中菲冲突目前处于\"低强度的冲突\"状态，没有出现军事动员、军事对抗、或者展示武力的行为，因此并未构成充分战端。《南海(南中国海)各方行为宣言》虽然无法消除海上冲突、摩擦与争执，但是能够用来限制战争。\"\n\n黄惠华表示，中菲依然或透过协商及谈判解决问题，特别是当俄罗斯在俄乌战争迟迟未解时，发展重心被迫从欧洲移往太平洋，促使南中国海的势力达到平衡，也同时降低了中菲之间爆发战争的指数。\n\n黄惠华认为，虽然南中国海并非俄罗斯的传统战略重点，俄罗斯也不是南中国海的\"协调者\"，但也因此基于不干涉原则，俄罗斯设法维持与南中国海周边各国的友好关系，主张和平解决南中国海争议，企图扮演南中国海和平的贡献者。\n\n她说:\"俄罗斯的策略也刺激中国与其他国家的军备竞赛与资源争夺。这种两面讨好的策略让中国不满，然而其他国家也乐见俄罗斯稀释中国与美国势力并且互相牵制，让南海(南中国海)局势处于平衡状态。\"\n\n黄惠华指出，即使中国是俄罗斯的盟国，俄罗斯也会优先考虑全球战略利益。\n\n驻菲律宾地缘政治分析师唐．麦克莱恩．吉尔表示，莫斯科与亚洲国家的接触确实愈发频繁，然而基于俄罗斯主张不干涉原则，对南中国海的影响有限。他认为，俄罗斯在南中国海争议上是边缘角色，只是与马来西亚、越南等国家推动双边关系，其影响力无论在经济或军事上都与美中相去甚远，特别是入侵乌克兰之后，更失去了在领土主权上发言的正当性，根本不足以稀释美中在南中国海的势力。\n\n美国重申支持菲国 多重管道强化对华威慑力\n\n美国国务卿布林肯6月19日针对中国在南中国海的各项\"升级\"行动，与菲律宾外交部长马纳罗（Enrique Manalo）通话进行讨论，强调美国对《美菲共同防御条约》承诺仍坚如盘石;美国副国务卿坎贝尔（Kurt Campbell）6月27日与中国副外长马朝旭通电话，对中国在南中国海的\"不稳定行为\"表示担忧，并且重申对菲国的支持。\n\n台湾开南大学国家与区域发展研究中心主任陈文甲表示，美国及其盟友在南中国海纷争中的介入方式十分多样，首先是重申海牙常设国际仲裁法院对南中国海仲裁案的裁决之正当性，以及利用联合国和东盟等国际组织的平台让中国感到被孤立的压力，同时也实施经济上的两手策略。\n\n他说:\"美国及其盟友将考虑实施经济制裁，限制中国企业在国际市场上的活动，从而对中国施加经济压力，迫使其在南海(南中国海)问题上更加谨慎。此外，美国也将加强对菲律宾的经济援助。\"\n\n陈文甲在设法促使菲国减少其对中国经济的依赖之同时，也增加菲国与日本、澳大利亚等盟友的联合军演次数和强度，才能对中国达到一定的威慑效果，减少其冒险行动的可能性，以避免中美之间的军事对抗风险。\n\n台湾国际战略学会信赖研究中心主任黄惠华表示，菲律宾与中国之间的不对称军事实力需要落实在许多层面，才会形成足够的威慑力。\n\n她说:\"美菲｀综合性威慑战略＇是否有效，关键在于菲律宾军事现代化是否能取得先进军备以及与盟国建立多重的政治与军事合作，包含各种军事技术合作、军演、各个双边与多边联盟互赖同盟关系。\"\n\n黄惠华指出，美国正在调整印太战略，就是希望遏制中国的威胁，达到\"亚洲安全，美国才能安全\"双向安全保障的战略意涵。\n\n小马科斯政府多元抗中措施\n\n菲律宾总统小马科斯6月23日在慰问菲律宾官兵时强调，菲律宾不会被任何人吓倒。他说: \"我们冷静和平的态度不应被误解为默许。\"同时，他希望和平解决南中国海争端。\n\n台湾开南大学国家与区域发展研究中心主任陈文甲表示，面对中国在外交和军事上的强势行动，小马科斯政府可能会采取一系列新的应对措施，除了购买更多巡航导弹、防空系统和海军舰艇等先进军事装备，同时也会增加海上巡逻力度，通过定期巡逻展示主权，甚至在战略要地建立新的军事基地。此外，他指出小马科斯政府一直致力于加强菲国的经济实力，为国防和外交提供坚实基础。\n\n他说:\"菲律宾政府将推动经济多元化，减少对中国市场和投资的依赖，通过加强与其他国家的经贸合作，提升经济的独立性。另一方面，菲律宾政府将促进国内产业升级，提升制造业、科技和基础设施建设。\"\n\n驻菲律宾地缘政治分析师唐·麦克莱恩·吉尔认为，其他的补充措施也能产生对中国的吓阻力，例如驱逐中国驻马尼拉的使节，使用更大更快的船只执行补给任务，为菲国船员配备非致命装备，以及为海上非传统小冲突提供训练。\n\n台湾国际战略学会信赖研究中心主任黄惠华指出，菲国正积极地与美国之外的伙伴建立更紧密的关系，例如澳大利亚、日本、欧盟、韩国的安全合作，而这些国家愿意提供菲律宾各种军事服务，包括官员互访、武器军售、军事援助、双边及多边联合军演、演训、军事技术转移、提供盟国使用菲律宾军事基地、港口等。她说，小马科斯深深了解合作力量可防止敌对势力坐大，如果中国破坏国际规则的话，也必须面对强大的敌对的美日及同盟势力。",

Key points include:\n\n1. **Recent Clashes**: On June 17, Chinese and Philippine vessels collided, with both sides blaming each other for the incident.\n2. **Statements from Officials**: Philippine military chief Romeo Brawner emphasized the need for preparedness but denied that recent military actions were aimed at China. President Marcos has instructed efforts to avoid war while maintaining sovereignty in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\n3. **Expert Opinions**: Analysts believe that while tensions are high, the likelihood of full-scale war is low due to the economic interests of both nations. Experts suggest that both countries will likely seek negotiations and diplomatic solutions.\n4. **International Involvement**: The U.S. has reiterated its support for the Philippines, with high-level discussions between U.S. and Philippine officials emphasizing the importance of the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty.\n5. **Strategic Measures**: The Philippines is enhancing its military capabilities and diversifying its economic partnerships to reduce dependence on China. The country is also strengthening ties with other nations like Japan, Australia, and the EU for security cooperation.\n\nOverall, the situation remains tense but controlled, with both nations and their allies focusing on diplomatic and strategic measures to manage the conflict."

        "body": "吉林大学德国教授杜本因为接受《美国之音》访问时，分析习近平今年5月访欧的企图和助俄入侵乌克兰，遭到中国当局强迫离职并被永久驱逐出境。杜本认为，该访谈是导致其遭中共报复的导火线。海外大学学者指，中国大学已变成党性十足的机构，并警示还想与中国密切合作的外国学者放弃幻想。\n\n《美国之音》上周六（6月29日）报道，中国吉林大学公共外交学院国际关系研究所外籍教授杜本（Björn Alexander Düben），因接受《美国之音》采访评论习近平的访欧之旅，遭中共当局驱逐。\n\n据悉，杜本持有中国当局签发的高级外国人才签证（R-Visa），有效期至2033年。在被驱逐前，他已在吉林大学工作了9年。\n\n吉林大学派出学院党委书记和行政人员通知杜本，其原来的签证被取消，转为「人道主义」签证，并要求其两星期内离开中国；其后，校方再以「无可用教室」，于5月15日取消了杜本当天的讲座；其后他再接获同事通知，其所有讲座和课程教学都被无限期取消，在吉林大学的工作也将终止。\n\n但校方管理人员给出两个方案：第一个是让杜本主动向大学递交辞职信；另一个是接受纪律调查或法庭审判。因担心对解聘提出异议会带来风险，杜本不得已选择「辞职」。随后，校方通知其必须在5月30日前离开中国，并告知如果他今后再想来中国，会被拒绝入境。校方人员称「这是上面的指示，没有商量馀地」。\n\n《美国之音》透露杜本已经回到德国，本台查询后发现，吉林大学官方网站已经删除了杜本的简介。\n\n杜本直指习近平访欧　意在分化欧美关系及试探欧盟内部裂痕\n\n杜本认为，招致他遭中共当局报复的导火线应该是他在《美国之音》5月11日发表的文章中所做的评论，对习近平睽违5年的访欧之旅，杜本直指习近平访欧意在分化欧美关系以及试探欧盟内部的裂痕。\n\n杜本表示：「在美国与欧盟之间打入一个楔子毫无疑问是北京的长期基本目标之一，也可能是习近平亲自出访的原因之一。多年来，中国不断尝试让欧洲国家摆脱与美国的联盟关系，但迄今为止收效甚微......另一个潜在动机可能是试图确定欧盟内部可能存在多大程度的裂痕，特别是在其对北京的立场方面。」\n\n杜本也警告：「法国与其他西方国家之间的任何潜在分歧都不应该被夸大，习近平的行程上有趣的遗漏了布鲁塞尔，他很可能故意忽略了这一点。虽然马克龙邀请了欧委会主席冯德莱恩前往巴黎参加了与（与习近平的）会谈。」\n\n习近平访欧时，法国总统马克龙及冯德莱恩促进其明确在俄乌战争中的角色；早前美国国防部揭中国向俄罗斯提供军用零件、技术等。\n\n杜本也在《美国之音》的访谈中指出这个问题，他强调：「俄罗斯目前最需要的零件是中国能够提供但难以追踪的特定军民两用零件。迄今为止，习近平并没有在这里做出切实的让步，而是只是试图将乌克兰持续流血事件的责任，从中国（和俄罗斯）身上转移到美国身上，在这方面，我认为欧洲人在打破中国与普京领导下的俄罗斯的牢固联系方面，不会取得多大成果。」\n\n评论：杜本点到习近平访欧之旅最忌讳的两点\n\n法国塞尔奇．蓬多瓦兹大学教授张伦向本台表示，杜本点到了习近平访欧之旅最忌讳的两点，包括离间欧美关系，及其在俄乌战争中助纣为虐。\n\n张伦说：「这样的一个外籍教授对中共的外交、尤其是习近平进行评论，甚至有一些批评，尤其是这样两个敏感的外交议题，一个是中欧关系、欧美关系；另外一个也是非常敏感，就是中国在俄乌战争当中，具体支持俄方军事备件等，现在已经越来越清楚，但是学者做这样的评论，北京肯定是比较恼怒的。」\n\n张伦也指，中共不但严厉管控自己的学者，当外籍学者加入中国大学后，也会受到同样的对待。\n\n张伦说：「这样一个事件并不让我感到意外、吃惊。外面的学者、西方的学者评论，因为中共鞭长莫及，大概也没有办法。那么你现在我的治下，即便这位学者是以非常客观的角度来看这个问题，谈不上了。」\n\n评论：中国高校早已在习近平执政后转为「姓党」\n\n曾在美国能源部下辖实验室任职的华裔学者Vader在接受本台采访时表示，中国高校已不再是教育和学术机构，早已在习近平执政后转为「姓党」。\n\nVader说：「吉林大学外籍助理教授因发表对习近平访欧评论而遭解职一事其实并不新鲜，因为在中国所谓高等教育和研究机构，尤其社科领域，本质就是为意识形态服务，在中国领导人大搞个人崇拜之时，更是会为领袖个人服务。」\n\nVader 也认为，事件也为可能对中国心存幻想的海外学者敲响警钟。\n\nVader说：「另一方面，这事件也为对心存幻想、乃至有意想拍中国政府马屁的欧美学者敲响了警钟，即在中国这个本质法无定法的社会，你的言论稍微不符合当局要求和心意，无论你是不是『中国人民的老朋友』，都会被当局铁拳。」\n\n杜本拥有伦敦政经学院国际关系学博士学位和牛津大学国际关系学硕士学位，在去中国工作之前曾就职于伦敦大学国王学院和伦敦政治经济学院，他亦曾在《路透社》等多家主流媒体和智库平台发表研究成果。\n\n近年来， 中国当局在大学高薪引进外籍学者，也透过发放奖学金吸引海外留学生进入中国大学。在中国的外国学者鲜少批评中共当局，大多扮演为中共「洗地」的角色，曾在清华大学毕业的希腊籍博士生、清华大学苏世民书院客座助理教授齐思源（Vasilis Trigkas）就曾大赞习近平的「新质生产力」概念。\n\n而在清华大学，2018年夏，德国留学生穆达伟（David Missal）因声援「709律师」和拍摄「709妻子」维权纪录片，遭驱逐出境。\n\n记者：吴亦桐、宋子杰（伦敦）　编辑：施芷珊",

Düben, who had a high-level foreign talent visa valid until 2033, was forced to resign and leave China within two weeks. His lectures and courses were canceled, and he was given the option to resign or face disciplinary action. Düben believes his comments on Xi's visit, which aimed to divide US-EU relations and probe EU internal fractures, led to his expulsion. This incident highlights the increasing control of Chinese universities by the Communist Party and serves as a warning to foreign scholars about the risks of criticizing Chinese policies."

        "body": "打不过要谈判？泽连斯基向普京求饶，北约一把手血口喷中国\n\n美国和北约一手导演了俄乌冲突，就是想通过战争灭亡俄罗斯，之后就能集中精力对付下一个对手--中国了。然而事与愿违，俄罗斯不仅没有完蛋，反而越打越强，目前牢牢掌控了战争主动权，距离取得胜利不远了。在这种情况下，北约竟然迁怒于中国，污蔑中国是俄乌冲突的制造者，简直岂有此理。这到底是怎么一回事儿呢？\n\n首先，泽连斯基考虑与俄罗斯谈判！\n\n日前乌克兰总统泽连斯基接受西方媒体采访时表示，可以通过第三方调解与俄罗斯实现谈判。因为\"黑海粮食走廊\"协议就是在联合国、土耳其的斡旋下与俄罗斯签署的。未来与俄谈判的第三方调解者可以是美国和西欧国家，也可以是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲等其他地区的国家。\n\n此前泽连斯基可是一口咬定称，只要普京继续执政，就绝不谈判，怎么现在态度却发生了180度大转弯呢？其实不难理解，主要是俄罗斯在乌东战场取得了优势。比如在哈尔科夫和顿涅茨克方向，俄乌战损比为1：6，此外\"爱国者\"导弹防御系统无法有效应对俄航空制导炸弹和滑翔炸弹，而且使用成本高昂。\n\n但这不是最狠的，更狠的是在过去一天内，乌军损失了2025名军人。按照这个减员幅度，再有10天就会有2万乌军战死。这对于严重缺兵缺武器的乌军而言，简直是一种沉重打击。\n\n泽连斯基引导乌军抵抗俄军的终极目标就是保住自己的政治地位和数十亿亿美元财富，所以没必要与俄罗斯拼个你死我活。再加上他的总统任期早已到头，国内反对声音巨大，泽连斯基于是产生了明哲保身的念头。\n\n何况，俄罗斯并没有关闭谈判大门，普京一再强调，与乌克兰的谈判可随时开启。因此，泽连斯基觉得到了与俄罗斯谈判，全身而退的时候了。所以现在泽连斯基要做的就是，给美俄制造一个接触谈判的机会，让他们自己谈谈怎么结束战争，自己就不用背负战争罪的黑锅了。\n\n其次，眼看俄乌要开始谈判，北约着急了，北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格声称中国煽动了俄乌冲突。\n\n日前北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格对日本媒体说，中国\"煽动了俄乌战争\"，并说中国是俄罗斯持续作战的重要支持者。在没有任何证据的情况下，斯托尔滕贝格就血口喷人指责中国，无疑会让想到北约的下一个对手就是中国。\n\n在笔者看来，这其实是一种潜意识，说明北约早就讨论过如何在收拾俄罗斯的同时对付中国的议题，并且早就有了应对预案。斯托尔滕贝格声称，北约要和日韩澳新等亚太国家合作，一起应对中国，这样有利于维护美西方主导的国际规则。\n\n这种预案，一则是凸显美西方的优越感，二则是给北约壮胆增加对抗中国的信心。这必须引起我们的高度警惕，我们必须要为与北约发生冲突做一些准备。\n\n目前，美日韩同盟已经基本成型，它是亚太北约的雏形，是美国针对中国的围堵战略的重要工具。如今美国觉得还不足以遏制中国，还要推动北约+日韩澳新，深化战略同盟一起打败中国。\n\n对此，中国绝不能掉以轻心，务必要做好军事斗争准备，另外一方面可在关键时刻支持俄罗斯阻挡北约，让北约无法集中精力对付中国。",

        "summary": "The news article discusses the evolving dynamics of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its broader geopolitical implications. Key points include:\n\n1. **Zelensky's Shift in Stance**: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who previously refused to negotiate with Russia as long as Vladimir Putin remained in power, has now expressed willingness to engage in talks through third-party mediation. This change is attributed to Russia's military gains in Eastern Ukraine and significant Ukrainian casualties.\n\n2. **NATO's Reaction**: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg accused China of inciting the Russia-Ukraine conflict and supporting Russia's ongoing military efforts. This accusation, made without evidence, suggests NATO's strategic focus may be shifting towards countering China.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Implications**: The article suggests that NATO has long considered strategies to confront both Russia and China. Stoltenberg's comments indicate a potential alliance between NATO and Asia-Pacific countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand to counter China.\n\n4. **China's Response**: The article emphasizes the need for China to prepare for potential military conflicts with NATO and to support Russia to prevent NATO from concentrating its efforts solely on China.\n\nThe article underscores the interconnectedness of global conflicts and the strategic calculations of major powers like the US, NATO, Russia, and China."

        "summary": "Kyiv is seeking to increase GDP-linked bonds to avoid a debt default amid the restructuring of approximately $20 billion in international debt. Despite failing to reach an agreement with bondholders during formal negotiations, Ukrainian authorities remain optimistic about achieving their debt restructuring goals by August 1. Key figures involved include Yuriy Butsa, head of Ukraine's Debt Management Office, and Gavin Gray, IMF's representative in Ukraine. The restructuring plan includes converting existing international bonds into new sovereign bonds maturing between 2034 and 2040, and introducing state-contingent debt instruments. The IMF's debt sustainability analysis has highlighted the importance of addressing GDP-linked bonds, which amount to $2.6 billion. The Ukrainian government has proposed measures to ensure these bonds do not trigger default events, but bondholders have countered with proposals that do not meet IMF requirements. The outcome of these negotiations is crucial for Ukraine's financial stability amid the ongoing conflict with Russia."

        "title": "要闻解说 - 匈牙利接任欧盟轮值主席国翌日 欧尔班首访基辅",
        "body": "欧尔班的新闻负责人哈瓦西 (Bertalan Havasi)向匈牙利国家通讯社MTI证实，欧尔班总理已于上午抵达基辅与乌克兰总统泽连斯基举行会谈。他表示，此次会谈的主要议题是乌克兰在抵抗俄罗斯入侵的同时建立和平的机会。同时两位领导人还将讨论匈牙利与乌克兰的双边关系。\n\n美联社报道指出，基辅官方目前尚未就欧尔班抵达基辅表态。\n\n匈牙利周一刚刚接任欧盟理事会轮值主席国，在乌克兰问题上匈牙利总理欧尔班与其他西方领导人明显不同。在匈乌关系因俄乌战争以来长期紧张背景下，他的此次对乌访问因而也是罕见之举。作为俄罗斯总统普京最亲密的欧盟盟友，欧尔班经常阻挠、拖延欧盟向乌克兰提供援助以及就乌克兰战争制裁莫斯科的努力，这让泽连斯基和其他欧盟领导人感到失望。\n\n今年早些时候，欧尔班否决了欧盟一项500亿欧元的援助乌克兰计划。尽管该计划最终获得批准，但援助的拖延受到乌克兰官员的批评。\n\n欧尔班自 2010年就任匈牙利总理执政至今，作为一个持欧洲怀疑论的领导人，他长期以来一直被欧洲伙伴指责破坏本国民主制度，阻挠破坏欧盟关键政策和优先事项。欧盟因涉嫌违反法治和腐败而冻结了对布达佩斯超过 200 亿美元的资助，而欧尔班则开展了多次反欧盟行动，称欧盟是一个过度集权、压制性的组织。\n\n欧尔班还曾激烈反对任何有关乌克兰加入欧盟的讨论，认为乌克兰尚未做好准备。 在去年 12 月欧盟 27 国领导人峰会上，在就启动乌克兰加入欧盟谈判的关键投票中，欧尔班最终同意离场，使得欧盟 26 国领导人通过对基辅的入盟谈判启动。\n\n周一，乌克兰泽连斯基对匈牙利开始担任欧盟轮值主席国表示 \"祝贺\"。他说，希望匈牙利能促进 \"欧洲共同的价值观、目标和利益\"。\n\n欧尔班一直与俄罗斯及总统普京保持密切关系，而自乌克兰战争爆发以来，西方已经切断了与普京的联系。欧尔班反其道而行，正加强本国与莫斯科的政治与经济联系。俄罗斯仍然是匈牙利能源供应的重要提供国。\n\n在对俄罗斯制裁问题上，欧尔班也持相左立场，反对并试图软化欧洲对俄罗斯的制裁，但并没有完全阻止制裁。他多次将俄罗斯对乌克兰的入侵描述为 \"军事行动\"，这一莫斯科使用的委婉用词。在去年10 月中国举行一带一路高峰会期间，欧尔班还在北京与普京会见，讨论能源合作问题。\n\n相反，他与泽连斯基的关系非常冷淡。法新社报道提到，欧尔班在 2022 年连任后的一次讲话中甚至把乌克兰总统列为自己的 \"对手 \"之一。而泽连斯基也在乌俄战争初期批评欧尔班的对乌立场。但双方还是有过多次会面，特别是 6 月底在布鲁塞尔举行的欧盟峰会期间。去年12 月，两人在阿根廷总统米莱就职典礼上的交流曾经引发关注，从网上的图片显示，双方对话气氛似乎非常紧张，而泽连斯基以 \"坦率 \"来形容此次交流。\n\n此次欧尔班对基辅的访问令外界意外，而据乌克兰官员表示，就两国领导人的会晤经过了数月磋商，两国外交部长今年1月底会谈，为双方领导人的会晤做准备。\n\n实际上，乌克兰与匈牙利的关系自俄罗斯入侵乌克兰之前就已摩擦不断，因为乌克兰自2017年以来采取了一系列有争议的措施引发双方交恶。在克里米亚危机后，基辅为强化民族认同、对抗俄罗斯文化影响，2017年出台法律要求在全国范围将乌克兰语作为学校必修课而引发境内匈牙利少数族裔的不满。在乌克兰最西部的外喀尔巴阡地区有约10 多马扎尔人，他们和匈牙利的主要民族是同一民族。当地在一战之前一直属匈牙利管辖。乌克兰在近期修改了引发争议的教育和语言法案，被视为是为争取匈牙利的支持，此次欧尔班访问基辅之行能否进一步改善双方关系仍需观察。\n\n在乌俄战争爆发后，匈牙利虽然与乌克兰接壤，但其接收的难民人数也远远少于大多数其他欧洲国家。",

        "summary": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán visited Kyiv to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a day after Hungary assumed the EU Council presidency. The main topics were Ukraine's resistance against Russia and peace opportunities, as well as bilateral relations. Orbán's visit is notable given his close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his opposition to EU aid and sanctions against Russia, which has frustrated Zelensky and other EU leaders. Despite Hungary's EU presidency, Orbán has been critical of EU policies and skeptical about Ukraine's EU membership. The visit follows months of diplomatic preparation and occurs amid historically tense Hungary-Ukraine relations, partly due to Ukraine's language laws affecting Hungarian minorities. The outcome of the visit on bilateral relations remains to be seen."

Currently, there are no negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, with significant differences in their conditions for ending the war. Ukraine demands a complete Russian withdrawal from its internationally recognized territories, including Crimea, while Russia insists on Ukraine ceding four eastern and southern regions.\n\nRecently, over 90 leaders and officials attended the first Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland, where Zelenskyy sought support for Ukraine's negotiation position. Meanwhile, Russian forces have exploited delays in Western military aid to Ukraine, launching large-scale attacks near Kharkiv, though their momentum has waned. Outgoing NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noted that Russian offensives have achieved minimal success and sees no signs of a significant Russian breakthrough.\n\nAdditionally, a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian village near the border killed five people, including two children, and injured two others. Both sides frequently use drones for attacks, with Ukraine intensifying strikes on Russian targets.

        "summary": "The article discusses the delicate balancing act of Chinese President Xi Jinping amid pressures from both the West and Russia. The U.S. and NATO have warned China against providing military support to Russia, threatening economic consequences if China continues its support. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg have accused China of aiding Russia's defense industry, which helps sustain its war efforts against Ukraine.\n\nChina, on the other hand, maintains that its trade with Russia is normal and not intended to fuel the conflict. However, internal and external pressures are mounting. Notably, Poland's President Andrzej Duda has urged Xi to reconsider support for Russia, highlighting the war's impact on Europe.\n\nThe article also mentions the defection of former Russian Deputy Defense Minister Tatyana Shevtsova to France, which could provide the West with insights into China's contributions to Russia's military capabilities.\n\nChina's economic ties with Russia have fluctuated, partly due to fears of secondary sanctions from the U.S. and NATO. Despite a temporary decline in trade, recent meetings between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin have led to a resurgence in trade activities, facilitated by smaller Chinese banks to avoid sanctions.\n\nThe West, particularly the U.S. and NATO, is considering expanding sanctions and rallying other countries, like Japan, to impose economic measures against China. Japan has already sanctioned Chinese entities aiding Russia, marking a significant move.\n\nThe article concludes by noting the strategic pressures on Xi from both the West and Russia, with the West offering potential economic incentives to sway China away from supporting Russia. The outcome of these geopolitical maneuvers could significantly impact the ongoing conflict in Ukraine."

The mutiny was driven by severe war fatigue and heavy losses among Russian troops. Additionally, Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian female prisoner assault unit and captured female prisoners for the first time.\n\nIn a separate but related event, former Russian Deputy Defense Minister Tatyana Shevtsova defected to the West, taking with her highly classified intelligence sought by NATO. This defection has caused significant turmoil within the Russian government, with President Putin reportedly furious and the new Defense Minister, Belousov, condemning Shevtsova as a traitor. The defection is expected to have severe implications for Russian military operations and intelligence security."

        "title": "阜成门六号院｜所有互联网平台都应该永远自觉抵制\"仇恨流量\"",
        "body": "阜成门六号院｜所有互联网平台都应该永远自觉抵制\"仇恨流量\"\n\n无疑，最近七八年全球的舆论生态，可以说是1970年代中期半世纪以来最糟糕的一段时期。在90年代或者21世纪初，人类自己以为制度和技术的进步可以避免非理性极端主义的泛滥，但是我们发现那时候的知识阶层过于自信了。没想到大致以2015年为界，全球范围内，从发达国家到发展中国家，保守主义、反理性主义、极端主义都是愈演愈烈，乃至已经盖过了理性声音。\n\n这个极端主义思潮的变化背后是有复杂的原因的，比如过去三十年的全球化、市场自由主义，在历史上最大规模重塑了人类的利益分配，从而带来国家间、宗教间、民族间、阶级间的新旧利益冲突，以及各自所代表的意识形态间的对峙。当然移动互联网及其创造的商业模式的兴起，从而产生的对社会舆论生态的重塑，也是重大诱因。\n\n在纸媒时代，乃至在PC端互联网时代。我们社会的信息生产权是掌握在职业媒体人以及知识分子手中的，这保证了信息的相对真实性，以及价值的相对温和性、中立性。尽管很多国家会有新闻管制，但是他们的媒体顶多是选择性发布信息，而很少去像自媒体博主那样随意捏造信息，毕竟他们还是要维护一国思想生态之平衡和宣传的信誉度。\n\n那个时候媒体承担的社会角色也比较单一，传媒只承担了社会运转中的一小部分功能，它与生产、商业是相对分离的，尤其是它顶多为商业提供广告服务，而不是商业活动的载体。\n\n但是移动互联网的出现，颠覆了这一切。首先来说，信息生产权从职业媒体人、知识分子转到普罗大众。过去发表文章、表达自己的见解观点，是极少数专业人士的事情，可是今天我们乡下在农田劳动的老舅，街头卖菜的大妈也都当起来博主来。这里有个数据，传统传媒时代，全国大致有电视广播机构2500余家、报纸1700余份、期刊10000余份，不过期刊里面大量是学术杂志，各类新闻媒体加起来不过五六千家，而现在自媒体主体，光活跃的公众号就2400多万，更不用说抖快B还有好几亿更活跃的视频老铁了。\n\n并且那些来自社会基层的博主内容流量远远高于专业博主。这是互联网受众群体的文化结构决定的，也是由人性决定的，人们认知倾向于简单化归因、二元对立、极端化，人们喜欢接受那些听起来很爽、很解气或很愤怒的东西。看北京大学的教授给你一五一十讲俄乌战争、中日关系，哪有听出租车大爷聊时事过瘾？现在就连高级知识分子都被价值之上的谣言小卡片或\"爽文\"屏蔽了信息，更何况普通受众了！\n\n所以，移动互联网的出现，让信息生产去中心化、去建制化，不可否认这具有进步性，普罗大众开始掌握信息话语权和表达权，但是人类很多领域的运转是讲究专业性的，比如政治、经济、医学等，外行取代内行、占据话语中心，最后社会会失序，人类会反受其害。\n\n其次，移动互联网也颠覆了经济运行规则。在移动互联网时代，媒体等于一切，媒体几乎成了我们所有一切经济和社会生活的承载体，生产、消费、社交、金融、物资流通等都高度依赖互联网信息平台，只要你获取了用户群和信息流，就等于掌握了最关键的商业资源。所以，媒体的价值和信息变现的能力，被急剧放大了。\n\n这种商业法则和信息生产模式的改变产生的融合效应就是，一些互联网平台公司为了流量的需求，也就是为了商业变现的目的，利用所谓\"算法规则\"，主动推送那些吸引眼球的，普罗大众\"喜闻乐见\"的劣质化、极端化信息。这些信息笔者分为四类：第一是谣言流量，第二是庸俗搞笑流量，第三是贩卖焦虑流量，第四是仇恨流量。\n\n笔者对短视频生态了解不深，但是根据\"新榜\"对每日公众号上10万＋话题的统计，那些社会和政治话题流量最高的，显然都是那些贩卖仇恨或\"吓尿体\"、\"震惊体\"居多。人们获取的信息越来越取决于算法的投喂，越来越段子化、谣言化、情绪化，所谓\"劣币驱逐良币\"。\n\n以我们对刚刚逝去不久的中国纸媒时代和PC互联网时代的记忆来看，那时候的媒体总体保持的是一种向上求真姿态。那个时代产生了很多优质的电视栏目、报纸、刊物，乃至互联网新闻频道，比如央视的《新闻调查》、《对话》，市场化媒体《财经》、《经济观察报》，腾讯网的《大家》、《今日话题》等等。媒体是一个充满温情、理性、深度思考的地方。\n\n但是我们可以明显感觉到，自从移动互联网普及到人们日常生活后，我们整个社会信息质量迅速下降，社会价值也越来越撕裂，社会情绪越来越暴戾化、对峙化。在国外表现就是特朗普为代表的激进右翼政客的崛起，他们绕过过去\"建制化媒体\"，直接用自媒体进行政治动员；在国内的表现就是大量那些处于边缘角落的低学历、非专业、反理性、反人道的\"言论领袖\"的崛起。\n\n这其中直接危害性最大，最值得警惕的是仇恨流量，虽然仇恨是人类社会中天然存在的一种情绪元素，但任由它发酵，会毁坏一个社会的平衡和繁荣。当然，互联网平台上流行的仇恨，不仅仅包括煽动对外部世界的民族仇恨，还有煽动的对内的各种仇恨，比如：\n\n对某些阶层的仇恨。最典型的是对民营企业家阶层的仇恨，把社会不公平等责任完全归咎为企业家，归咎为企业资本。\n\n地域、民族、宗教仇恨。利用刻板印象，编造信息刻意丑化某一地域人群，进而对其进行各种权利歧视；以及无限放大对一些少数民族和宗教与汉族文化差异性，贴上各种阴谋论标签。\n\n价值观仇恨。主要是对主张法治、权利、自由、平等、开放等价值观的知识分子、媒体、法律阶层的仇恨，不分青红皂白就扣上\"汉奸\"、\"第五纵队\"的帽子（当然很多以\"自由派\"自居的人，也乐于给别人扣\"极左\"、\"义和团\"之类的帽子，进行人格、道德全面否定，不过此类人主张尊重人权、不主张进行人身迫害）。\n\n而仇恨流量的最终结果是诉诸暴力和肉体消灭。近两年涌现出几位知名度很高的自媒体博主，竟然堂而皇之主张处决汉奸（或者主张为了消灭某个假象敌，不惜死个1亿人口），关键\"汉奸\"是一个很弹性模糊的文化词汇，而不是法律词汇，他们可以随意定义你是汉奸，所以就可以汉奸罪处决任何人。这种言论却从来得不到制裁，反而很多人理性讨论一些话题心惊胆战，今天被禁言，明天被删帖。\n\n这种言论以及背后价值流行下去，只能会造成未来一旦经济情况不好，很可能出现流血暴力。所以，笔者又称之为\"人血流量\"。而且这种暴力一定是无序的，会不断发明新的敌人，将攻击范围无限扩大化，每个人都有可能会成为受害者，如果觉得我是危言耸听或胡说八道，建议好好读读20世纪的世界史，你会发现无数个经典素材。\n\n因此，现在网易、腾讯等互联网平台发了公告，给与煽动中日对立、挑动极端民族主义的的博主给予处分，体现了他们的社会担当。如果让说真话的人心惊胆战，让造谣、制造仇恨的人躺着赚钱，那这个舆论场太不正常了，这个社会太没有希望了。\n\n但是笔者觉得这还远远不够，就内容上讲，不仅要严厉制裁那些宣传对外仇恨，还要制裁那些煽动我们中国社会社会内部仇恨对立的。往往一个社会仇外情绪，受制于国际较量，最后很难成气候，伤害不了几个外国人；但是对内部自己人的仇恨，却很可容易造成骇人听闻的悲剧。\n\n我们也希望不仅仅网易、腾讯要行动，其他平台，尤其是视频平台更要有切实的行动，不仅是发个公告而已。毕竟现在信息流中，视频的比重远远大于文字，这方面视频平台的责任更大。\n\n笔者最后要说的是，现在互联网平台规模都很大了，资金实力都很雄厚了，几个大的互联网平台企业都是全球500强或者排名前20的独角兽。这些企业应该学习借鉴一下谷歌、微软此类国际同行，学会靠真正解决人类的难题，创造技术核心竞争力赚钱，而不是无限延续单纯靠流量赚钱的\"粗放\"模式。\n\n如果在这种模式已经显露出巨大社会危险性的时候，依然无动于衷、置身其外，不仅丧失了一个科技企业应有的社会责任，亵渎了科技本身的价值，他们自身最终也会遭到极端主义思潮的反噬。",

        "summary": "The article discusses the deteriorating global public opinion environment over the past seven to eight years, highlighting the rise of conservatism, anti-rationalism, and extremism since around 2015. It attributes this shift to factors such as globalization, market liberalism, and the advent of mobile internet, which decentralized information production from professional media to the general public. This shift has led to a proliferation of low-quality, extreme content driven by algorithms on internet platforms, prioritizing sensationalism and \"hate traffic\" for commercial gain.\n\nThe article emphasizes the dangers of \"hate traffic,\" which includes spreading rumors, vulgar content, anxiety-inducing information, and hate speech. It warns that such content can lead to societal division, violence, and the erosion of rational discourse. The author calls for internet platforms to take responsibility and actively resist promoting hate-driven content. Recent actions by platforms like NetEase and Tencent to penalize content that incites extreme nationalism are seen as positive steps, but the author argues that more comprehensive measures are needed across all platforms, especially video platforms.\n\nThe article concludes by urging large internet companies to adopt more responsible business models, akin to those of international tech giants like Google and Microsoft, focusing on solving real human problems and fostering technological innovation rather than merely chasing traffic. Failure to do so, the author warns, could result in these companies being undermined by the very extremism they help propagate."

This visit, Modi's first bilateral trip since winning his third term, breaks the tradition of visiting neighboring countries like Bhutan, Maldives, and Sri Lanka first. The visit underscores India's emphasis on its relationship with Russia, a key supplier of military hardware and a major source of crude oil for India. Discussions are expected to cover military logistics cooperation, the joint development of fifth-generation fighter jets, and nuclear energy collaboration, though no major agreements are anticipated."

        "summary": "On July 2, 2024, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban arrived in Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. This visit marks Orban's first trip to Ukraine since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war. The primary agenda of their talks is to explore opportunities for peace between Russia and Ukraine and to discuss bilateral relations. Orban's visit coincides with Hungary's first day as the rotating president of the EU Council, a role that allows Hungary to influence the EU's agenda and priorities. Orban has previously criticized Western military aid to Ukraine, arguing it exacerbates the conflict. He advocates for peace negotiations and a ceasefire to end the war. Hungary has historically opposed EU intervention in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and has maintained relations with Moscow."

        "title": "北约将向基辅派高级文官 寻求使对乌援助\"不受特朗普影响",
        "body": "据《华尔街日报》报导，美国和北约官员表示，北约将向基辅派驻一名高级文职官员，预计下周在华盛顿举行的峰会上将宣布一系列旨在加强对乌克兰长期支持的新措施。这些措施旨在支持乌克兰最终加入该联盟的前景，而无需向其提供成员资格。采取这些措施的背景是欧洲极右翼政治势力抬头，前总统特朗普重返白宫并减少美国对乌克兰支持的可能性与日俱增。\n\n北约组织还将在德国威斯巴登设立一个新的指挥部，负责协调向乌方提供军事装备和训练乌军人员的工作。这项行动名为\"北约乌克兰安全援助与培训\"，将由来自32国联盟的近700名美国和其他盟国人员组成。该行动将接管自2022年2月俄罗斯全面入侵乌克兰以来一直由美军负责的大部分任务。这些新举措已酝酿数月，但在拜登总统周四与特朗普的电视辩论中表现不佳，以及特朗普抱怨美国在乌克兰问题上花费了大量资金之后，这些拟议中的举措又有了新的紧迫性。\n\n2009年至2013年曾任美国驻北约大使的达尔德（Ivo Daalder）说：\"这一变化的一个重要原因是为了使对乌克兰的援助工作不受特朗普的影响\"。他指出，\"北约将取代华盛顿负责管理培训和援助。因此，即使美国减少或撤回对这项工作的支持，也不会取消这项工作\"。\n\n随着极右翼政党在法国、荷兰和整个欧盟获得越来越多的选民支持，北约作用的制度化也可能使对乌克兰的军事援助不那么容易受到盟国政策波动的影响。曾于2013年至2017年担任美国驻北约大使的卢特（Douglas Lute）说：\"面对潜在的国家政治变化，无论是美国、法国、英国还是欧盟的选举结果，北约的作用都具有持久性\"。\n\n美国现任和前任官员说，这些措施将使北约能够更好地协调西方国家向乌克兰提供军事支持的努力，而这已成为莫斯科和西方国家在北约大门口的一场旷日持久的意志考验。该计划还旨在使乌军更像北约军队。所有盟国领导人都将出席在华盛顿举行的北约峰会，会上将重点讨论支持乌克兰的倡议，75年前北约的创始条约就是在华盛顿签署的。该条约的目的是保护其成员国免受来自莫斯科的威胁 -- -- 北约正再次承担起这一使命。\n\n北约外交官说，尽管条款仍在谈判中，但联盟成员希望华盛顿峰会还能就每年向乌克兰提供军事支持的财政承诺达成一致。联盟成员最近的讨论包括设定每年大约400亿美元的目标，并增加许多盟国的捐款额，但美国可能仍将是主要对乌捐助国。\n\n许多盟国表示，北约应邀请乌克兰加入，启动一个可能需要数年时间的进程，但美国和德国反对在下周的峰会上采取这一步骤。官员们说，为了掩盖北约内部的分歧，联盟很可能将乌克兰加入北约的申请说成是\"不可逆转的\"，而去年北约维尔纽斯峰会公报中的措辞是\"乌克兰的未来在北约\"，2008年峰会的公报则称乌克兰总有一天会成为北约成员国。\n\n根据已商定并将在华盛顿峰会上最终批准的倡议，来自非美国成员的工作人员将在新的北约威斯巴登指挥部与美国人并肩工作，根据乌方的需求调整军事装备捐赠并协调交付。他们还将协调对乌军的培训工作，以确保所提供的装备符合基辅的需求。\n\n官员们说，北约工作人员本身不会进行任何培训。这些转变旨在建立机构动力，并传播从数十个国家向乌克兰边境输送物资所涉及的琐碎后勤知识。北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格（Jens Stoltenberg）上月曾在布鲁塞尔表示，这些变化将使北约对乌克兰的支持\"在未来数年内有更坚实的基础\"。\n\n虽然这一变化将扩大北约的参与，但美国将继续提供大部分人员，这些人员将向美国欧洲司令部司令兼任北约欧洲盟军最高司令卡沃利（Christopher Cavoli）报告。驻基辅的北约高级文职官员将重点关注乌克兰的长期军事现代化需求和非军事支持，并与计划中的威斯巴登指挥部和北约布鲁塞尔总部建立联系。新措施还标志着北约态势的重要转变。联盟最初与乌克兰的军事行动保持距离，以避免被指责为冲突的一方。组织结构的变化意味着北约现在准备在帮助基辅抗击俄罗斯入侵方面发挥更重要的作用。\n\n美国国务院一位高级官员说：\"由于北约盟国向乌克兰提供的安全援助占援助总额的90%以上，北约自然是协调援助以确保乌克兰现在和将来更有能力保卫自己的地方\"。华盛顿峰会正值美国政坛的关键时刻。拜登把他在动员北约支持乌克兰方面发挥的作用作为其任内外交政策的主要成就之一，白宫一直在寻求帮助乌方抵御俄军的进攻，同时限制冲突升级为美俄直接冲突的风险。拜登还表示，阻止乌克兰境内的俄军对阻止莫斯科在欧洲其他地区甚至更远地区的侵略至关重要。\n\n拜登在上周四的电视辩论中说：\"我得到了世界上其他50个国家对乌克兰的支持，包括日本和韩国。（历史证明）欧洲发生的任何一场大规模战争都无法仅局限于欧洲境内\"。特朗普则称乌总统泽连斯基（Volodymyr Zelenskyy）是\"有史以来最伟大的推销员\"，因为他说服了美国向基辅提供巨额军事支持，并称俄乌战争对欧洲国家来说比对美国来说是一个更大的安全问题，\"因为我们中间有一片海洋\"。\n\n特朗普还宣称要在宣誓就任总统前，就泽连斯基与俄总统普京之间的外交协议进行谈判。特朗普没有解释这种和解的条件是什么，但他说，普京要求莫斯科保留乌克兰东部被占领的4个州，同时乌方放弃加入北约的申请，这是不可接受的。特朗普称：\"在我于1月20日就任总统之前，我将解决普京和泽连斯基之间的战争\"。",

This move aims to ensure continued support for Ukraine, even if former President Trump, who has criticized U.S. spending on Ukraine, returns to power. The new measures, to be announced at an upcoming summit in Washington, are designed to support Ukraine's eventual NATO membership without granting immediate membership. The initiative will involve nearly 700 personnel from 32 NATO countries and aims to institutionalize NATO's role in aiding Ukraine, making it less susceptible to political changes in member countries. The U.S. will continue to play a significant role, but the new structure will allow NATO to manage aid and training more independently. The summit will also discuss financial commitments for military support to Ukraine, with a target of around $40 billion annually."

        "body": "俄乌战争第860天（2024年7月2日），先来看看乌克兰对克里米亚的袭击。\n\n7月1日，乌军导弹袭击克里米亚塞瓦斯托波尔，俄军称击落所有导弹，但俄军后勤基地疑似被击中，损失仍在澄清。\n\n乌军还袭击俄罗斯别尔哥罗德、库尔斯克、沃罗涅日三个地区，导致这些地区大范围停电，只能说，俄罗斯人将习惯战争带来的代价。\n\n俄军过去四天向别尔哥罗德投掷9枚炸弹和枚导弹，过去一年至少投掷38枚炸弹自己炸自己。\n\n由于俄军飞机担心被乌军击落，远距离投掷准星太差，多次将炸弹投掷到自己领土，这就有点过分。\n\n7月1日，俄军用伊斯坎德尔导弹袭击乌克兰米尔戈罗德空军基地，根据视频显示，至少摧毁1架Su-27飞机，损坏其他几架飞机。\n\n俄军宣布摧毁乌军F-16战机，显然是宣传过猛，被击中的飞机不是F-16，只是Su-27，也没有发生大爆炸。\n\n如果为正常的飞机都是加满航空燃料随时准备起飞的，更多信息显示这些飞机可能为无法飞行的Su-27备件，已经停在机场很久，而且没有任何伪装和防空。\n\n乌克兰空军官员尤里·伊格纳特（很久前就不是乌克兰空军发言人）称乌军遭遇一些损失，但不是俄罗斯声称的损失。\n\n乌军将无防护Su-27战机露天放置在伊斯坎德尔导弹射程内，更像是迷惑和消耗俄军导弹。\n\n既然是战争，俄乌互相攻击就会有损失，俄军的无人机技术在最近半年大幅度提升，值得乌克兰警惕。\n\nF-16 战机配合爱国者防空系统如何发挥最大效果，值得关注。\n\n来看看战场最新消息，哈尔科夫地区，俄军似乎在这里中陷阱，乌军正消耗俄军。\n\n乌军使用高精度炸弹、各种火炮、无人机猛烈打击俄军，俄军不得不抽调部队继续向这里增援。\n\n乌军向哈尔科夫派遣数万人，人数明显多过俄军，却没有猛攻，目的显然不是反击，而是消耗俄军。\n\n仅乌军第三突击旅就宣布过去一周杀死500名俄军士兵，更不要说其他部队的战果。\n\n哈尔科夫战役成为俄军鸡肋，也成为一个新的转折点，很多趋势从五月开始变了。\n\n俄军突击小组进入乌克兰苏梅地区试图制造新的热点，直接被乌军发射JDAM炸弹摧毁集结点。\n\n这足以说明，俄军哈尔科夫已经失败，在苏梅挑衅也不会有好结果。\n\n阿夫迪夫卡地区，俄军继续向西攻击，试图拉平新奥列克桑德里夫卡-索基尔沿线，但进展有限。\n\n巴赫穆特地区，俄军继续从多个方向攻击恰西夫亚尔，甚至使用TOS发射燃烧弹实施\"焦土\"战术，但未能取得有效进展。\n\n马林卡-新海利夫卡地区、扎波罗热地区，俄军继续攻击，损失惨重。\n\n赫尔松地区，乌军用导弹袭击赫尔松地区左岸新卡霍夫卡的俄军基地，发生数次爆炸后发生强烈火灾，俄军损失未知。\n\n库皮扬斯克-克雷明纳-莱曼地区，乌军继续向克雷明纳实施反击，俄军在多个方向攻击没有进展。\n\n武莱达尔方向，俄军士兵驾驶摩托车攻击乌军阵地，以掩盖缺乏重装备的事实，但大多数都是自杀式攻击，损失惨重。\n\nBMP-1炮塔的火炮、BTR 70装甲运兵车、T-62坦克、摩托车、滑板车，高尔夫球车被用作俄军进攻、运输工具，让人不得不怀疑俄军的资源还能维持多久。\n\n7月2日，乌克兰公布俄军损失数据，俄军人员每天过千损失，累计损失超过54.5万人， 已不是小数字。\n\n7月2日，匈牙利总理欧尔班访问基辅，担任欧盟轮值主席国之后，欧尔班出访首站。\n\n过去两年多不少欧洲国家领导人到访基辅，这是欧尔班首次访问基辅。\n\n从匈牙利最近的表现来看，欧尔班很会看风向，这是一个明显的信号。\n\n欧盟主席冯德莱恩、欧洲委员会秘书长贝尔塞、欧盟外交政策负责人卡拉斯、北约秘书长吕特，加上不少欧洲国家最近都转向支持乌克兰，只能说，欧洲共识之下，欧尔班很会做出选择。\n\n随着欧洲国家愈发强硬，俄罗斯未来占不到什么便宜，代价将很高。\n\n7月1日，土耳其、保加利亚和罗马尼亚已开始在黑海开展扫雷行动，在黑海搜寻水雷，以提高乌克兰粮食运输船的航行安全。\n\n土耳其站在哪一边已经很清晰，土耳其30多年未能加入欧盟，而乌克兰欧盟谈判已经启动。\n\n芬兰议会批准开放15个军事基地供美军使用，美军真的到了俄罗斯家门口。\n\n7月1日，荷兰宣布颁发出口许可证，乌克兰\"很快\"将获得24架荷兰F-16战机中的首批。\n\n美国众议院民主党人敦促五角大楼扩大对乌克兰 F-16飞行员的培训。\n\n美国国务卿布林肯表示，在不久的将来，甚至可能在下周北约峰会之前，乌克兰就应该会收到关于加强防空的新声明。\n\n北约将向乌克兰派遣常驻高级官员确保对乌克兰的武器供应在任何情况下都不会停止，即使特朗普赢得美国大选、右翼势力赢得欧洲大选。\n\n7月2日，在荷兰举行的援助乌克兰爱国者防空系统进行调试，出现的ACSV G5防空版雷达，这意味着交付过程将非常快。\n\n荷兰组装的爱国者防空系统将很快抵达乌克兰，北约峰会之后，乌克兰防空力量将大大增强。\n\n泽连斯基接受采访时提到可以通过第三方以类似黑海粮食协议的模式谈判，实际上是变相拒绝很多国家的劝和。\n\n在战争上分出胜负之前不可能有谈判，很多人认为乌克兰要认输是误读，乌克兰不想与普京谈判，也不会用领土做交易。\n\n更何况乌克兰状况比两年前好很多，现在认输，不符合逻辑和认知。\n\n波兰总理图斯克强调，乌克兰经受住了俄罗斯的攻击，乌克兰迟早会赢得这场战争。\n\n认为乌克兰将赢得胜利的人越来越多，乌克兰将克服一切挑战，赢得最终胜利。",

Ukrainian officials downplayed the damage, suggesting the targeted aircraft were non-operational.\n\nIn Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces are strategically depleting Russian resources without launching a full-scale offensive. Meanwhile, Russian forces faced setbacks in Sumy, Avdiivka, Bakhmut, and other regions, suffering significant losses.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán visited Kyiv, signaling a shift in European support towards Ukraine. The Netherlands announced the imminent delivery of Patriot air defense systems and F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. NATO and the EU are bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities, with the U.S. also increasing pilot training.\n\nTurkey, Bulgaria, and Romania began mine-clearing operations in the Black Sea to secure grain shipments. Finland approved U.S. military base access, indicating increased Western military presence near Russia.\n\nUkrainian President Zelensky emphasized that negotiations with Russia are unlikely until a decisive outcome is achieved.

The Chinese state media highlighted themes like the \"New Silk Road,\" \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" and \"Community of Shared Future for Mankind,\" suggesting significant benefits provided to Kazakhstan by China. Xi's arrival was marked by high-level reception and military escort.\n\nXi's visit includes discussions with Kazakh President Tokayev on bilateral relations, comprehensive cooperation, and regional and international issues. The SCO, founded by China and Russia in 2001, includes Central Asian countries, India, Iran, and Pakistan. The summit, held from July 3-4, will focus on economic and energy issues, the Russia-Ukraine war, and other geopolitical matters.\n\nThere is speculation about a potential meeting between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who will also attend the summit. Their discussions, if they meet, are expected to cover aid, cooperation, and Western sanctions. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and China's deepening ties with Russia have posed challenges for Kazakhstan, which seeks to maintain neutrality.\n\nXi will also visit Tajikistan, where China has promised significant investments in infrastructure projects. The summit and potential Xi-Putin meeting are closely watched for their implications on international relations and regional stability."

His unit, comprising around 100 soldiers, is well-equipped with transport vehicles, armored cars, drones, Starlink receivers, and anti-tank missiles. The U.S. has provided significant support, including Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles, enhancing Ukraine's combat capabilities.\n\nNATO's information support allows Ukrainian forces to anticipate Russian air and ground attacks, effectively countering them. This has forced the Russian military to adapt by using forest and urban warfare tactics. Strategically, the UK-supplied \"Storm Shadow\" missiles and U.S.-supplied HIMARS have inflicted significant damage on Russian forces and infrastructure.\n\nThe article also warns that the U.S. might apply similar strategies in Taiwan, suggesting a need for vigilance and study. Russian military adaptations are noted, with General Surovikin highlighted for his effective responses."

        "body": "刚被普京处理完，俄军高层\"女一号\"，卷走几十亿美元叛逃西方？\n\n刚被普京处理完，俄军高层\"女一号\"，卷走几十亿美元叛逃西方？俄军\"女一号\"是谁？她是如何叛逃的，又为什么要逃？\n\n近日，俄罗斯国内流传出一则令人震惊的消息，作为俄军\"女一号\"的俄罗斯原国防部副部长塔季扬娜·舍夫佐娃大将，疑似在6月中旬被解职后秘密叛逃至西方。毫无疑问，若此消息属实，舍夫佐娃将成为俄乌战争爆发以来，俄方叛逃的最高级别官员。\n\n据外媒报道，舍夫佐娃在离职后，除了携带大量现金独自一人乘飞机前往法国外，还通过虚拟货币向境外转移数十亿美元资产。更加离谱的是，在此期间没有受到任何部门阻拦。目前，这一消息尚未得到俄罗斯官方证实，且舍夫佐娃与其他俄方官员均未出面辟谣。\n\n可以想象，一旦这一消息被\"实锤\"，必定引发俄罗斯政坛动荡。要知道，舍夫佐娃才刚刚被普京处理完，从国防部副部长的位置上被解职，转眼间便叛逃到西方，这无疑是对普京本人和国家的严重挑衅。\n\n在这一消息传出后，有分析人士指出，舍夫佐娃的叛逃，可能与普京政府近期的反腐行动有关。据悉，舍夫佐娃自2010年起担任俄国防部副部长，负责俄军资金管理事务长达14年之久，她的上位很可能与俄罗斯前防长谢尔久科夫有关。而在任职期间，她与绍伊古的关系也很密切。更有甚者，俄罗斯国内早就有传言称，舍夫佐娃夫妇拥有巨额不明财产，可能涉及腐败案件。\n\n在此情况下，如果舍夫佐娃确实叛逃西方，其后果将不堪设想。首先，她的叛逃很可能引发俄罗斯官场\"大清洗\"。一方面，她的轻松出境叛逃存在重要疑点。试想一下，如果她在俄罗斯国内外都受到高度关注，却能够带着一大箱子现金成功出境，那么这背后可能涉及到一些更加复杂的东西。比如说，有没有境外势力协助？在俄罗斯政坛内存不存在同伙？无论是哪一个都将引发普京的怒火。\n\n另一方面，她的叛逃还可能导致俄军内部重要情报泄露，舍夫佐娃作为国防部高层，对俄军的军备采购、资金调用及作战目标等情况了如指掌。如果她向西方情报部门提供这些信息，势必将对前线的俄军构成严重威胁。除此之外，她的叛逃还将对俄罗斯士气造成沉重打击，并可能引发更多高层人员叛逃的\"连锁反应\"。\n\n事实上，舍夫佐娃的叛逃传言，再次凸显了俄罗斯结构性腐败问题的严重性。在俄乌战争持续的背景下，普京政府需要尽快采取有效措施，解决这一问题，确保国家的长治久安。否则一旦任由恶劣影响蔓延开来，最终很可能导致俄罗斯政治局势的总崩盘。\n\n值得注意的是，舍夫佐娃叛逃到法国之后将会面临的情况，也成为关注和猜测的重点。关于西方会不会没收舍夫佐娃的财产？也存在多种可能性。如果西方没收其财产，那么会不会让其他想要叛逃的俄罗斯官员不敢叛逃？如果西方不没收其财产，那么将会给出怎样的理由？除此之外，还存在一些情况，比如西方国家并不知道舍夫佐娃的具体行踪和财产情况；或者说他们即使知道，也可能因为各种原因而选择不采取行动。\n\n当然，这些都只是基于\"舍夫佐娃叛逃\"消息被证实的情况下的分析。在俄罗斯官方和舍夫佐娃本人未给出回应之前，我们需要保持理性和客观，等待更多确凿的证据出现。同时，我们也应该从俄方的教训中吸取经验，认清结构性腐败可能导致的危害。对于这种可能存在的\"窝案\"\"要案\"，我们也需要从根本上加以杜绝。",

        "summary": "A shocking rumor has emerged from Russia, suggesting that Tatyana Shevtsova, the former Deputy Minister of Defense and a high-ranking female official, has defected to the West after being dismissed in mid-June. If true, Shevtsova would be the highest-ranking official to defect since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. Reports indicate she fled to France with large sums of cash and transferred billions of dollars in assets via cryptocurrency, without any interference from Russian authorities.\n\nThis potential defection could cause significant political turmoil in Russia, as Shevtsova was recently dismissed by President Vladimir Putin. Analysts speculate her defection might be linked to recent anti-corruption efforts by the Putin administration. Shevtsova, who managed military funds for 14 years, has been rumored to possess significant unexplained wealth, possibly tied to corruption.\n\nIf confirmed, her defection could lead to a major purge within the Russian government and military, as it raises questions about possible internal and external collusion. Additionally, Shevtsova's knowledge of military operations and finances could pose a severe threat if shared with Western intelligence, potentially demoralizing Russian forces and triggering further defections.\n\nThe situation underscores the deep-rooted corruption within Russia and the urgent need for effective measures to address it. The West's response to Shevtsova's defection, particularly regarding her assets, remains uncertain and could influence future defections. However, until official confirmation is provided, these remain speculative analyses."

        "body": "普京想给胡塞导弹，沙特搅局，小王子不愿俄罗斯介入加沙战争\n\n木叔这篇国际评论，来分析俄罗斯对加沙战争的介入。\n\n7月1日，中东媒体引述一名美国官员的话说，俄罗斯不久前推动给也门胡塞武装更多军火，作为对抗西方给乌克兰售武的一种报复措施。但是被沙特给阻止了。\n\n普京考虑向胡塞武装分子提供反舰巡航导弹，这种导弹飞行高度更低、更难被探测和拦截，非常适合攻击船只等特定目标。目前胡塞的武器库中有巡航导弹，但是伊朗提供的。如果俄罗斯给胡塞这种导弹，肯定在红海攻击货轮的效果会更好。\n\n不过美国情报部门称，沙特王储小萨勒曼很不高兴，公开进行了干预，阻止俄罗斯的这个动作。\n\n小萨勒曼在普京几个月前访问沙特时与之谈论此事，要求俄罗斯不要寻求这一安排。普京随后表示，与沙特已经就消除地区紧张局势达成共识。\n\n也多亏了沙特，目前还没看到俄罗斯给胡塞输送军火，也避免了加沙战争进一步扩大化。\n\n在我看来，从这件事上能看出加沙战争的两个动向。\n\n第一，加沙战争并不是孤立存在的，它与俄乌战争和全球其他地区的冲突和博弈密切相关。\n\n一些人认为俄罗斯专注于俄乌战场，没能力在其他地方与西方对抗，这个想法很天真。不只是在巴以冲突上，就是在朝鲜半岛局势上，都能看出这个俄罗斯和西方对抗的线索。\n\n因而俄罗斯试图给胡塞更好的武器，既是加沙战争外溢效应之一，也是俄罗斯在全球与西方博弈的战略布局。\n\n第二，沙特不想看到俄罗斯介入加沙战争。\n\n尽管沙特和俄罗斯关系也不错，但沙特毕竟不愿意看到伊朗的小伙伴胡塞武装在自己家门口做大。所以在这个问题上，基本没有商量的余地，肯定反对俄罗斯武装胡塞。\n\n同时这也符合沙特和美国关系更密切，以及与以色列关系走近的现实。俄罗斯很难改变。特别是加沙战争结束后，沙特与西方和以色列关系改善可能会加速，这是俄罗斯不愿看到的，因而给胡塞提供武器也等于在阻止这个进程，沙特能高兴吗？",

The Saudi Crown Prince's intervention came after discussions with Putin during his visit to Saudi Arabia, where they agreed to reduce regional tensions. This move by Saudi Arabia has so far prevented the escalation of the Gaza conflict and highlighted the interconnectedness of global conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine war.

        "body": "因为众所周知的原因，和大家分别半个月了。只能感叹一句：说人话、说实话太难了。\n\n这段时间\"俄乌战争\"前线没啥好说的明显进展，局座感觉：交战双方都在拖时间，有可能打不动了，也有可能是在憋什么大招。\n\n网上一个小道消息火了：前国防部长绍伊古的副手，俄国防部副部长舍夫佐娃\"叛逃\"了。\n\n克宫对于舍夫佐娃的潜逃并未正式回应，但外界却传来了新任俄罗斯防长别洛乌索夫的愤怒反应。\n\n舍夫佐娃和普京、梅德韦杰夫一样，出身于\"圣彼得堡帮\"。从收税员做起，2004年担任俄罗斯税务局副局长，2010年开始担任国防部副部长，2012年被授予大将军衔，当年年仅41岁。\n\n舍夫佐娃是全球自有现代军衔制度以来，军衔最高的女性，还拥有俄\"国家最高顾问\"的头衔。\n\n据福布斯富豪榜的情报：在俄国防部多年，舍夫佐娃未雨绸缪，在国外购买了昂贵的公寓、土地和豪华汽车，据传此次叛逃到俄罗斯的敌对国 -- -- 法国巴黎。\n\n严格地说，舍夫佐娃并不是普京亲信。\n\n6月17日，普京下令解职4名国防部的副防长后，取代舍夫佐娃职位的，是普京的亲侄女齐维列娃，这位才是亲信。\n\n顺便说一下，齐维列娃的丈夫是俄罗斯现任能源部部长，她自己则掌管着一家大型煤炭公司。\n\n能源、煤炭，这是俄罗斯最大的经济命脉。这说明啥？\n\n说明虽然普京靠\"反对金融寡头\"获得了大量的赞誉，但目前俄罗斯的体制，国家资源依旧掌握在少数人手里，和过去没啥两样。\n\n再来说说\"叛逃传言\"背后的猜测。\n\n能影响俄罗斯国防部的，不过一二人而已，除了普京就是梅德韦杰夫。\n\n2010年，正是时任俄总统梅德韦杰夫，将舍夫佐娃任命为俄罗斯国防部副部长，近十四年掌管俄国防部的财政大权，\"俄乌战争\"爆发后，还负责对伤亡士兵的抚恤善后工作。\n\n说到这，正式谈谈局座个人的看法。\n\n1、俄军腐败程度令人发指。说实话，俄罗斯的腐败之深大家都有耳闻。俄国防部这次系统性腐败，几个副部长被一锅端，下面的各级干部肯定牵连无数。\n\n战争期间还敢大发\"国难财\"，和平时期肯定也是大大的偷油耗子。\n\n2、背后牵连很大。俄国防系统腐败案后，舍夫佐娃应该处于被严密监视控制的状态。那她怎么逃走的呢？应该是她背后的实权大人物，悄悄地帮了她，当然也是帮了自己。\n\n这里插一句，局座发现最近\"大嘴\"梅德韦杰夫没怎么发声了。难道是泥菩萨过江？想想有这么可能，当年他的儿子在美国过着奢靡的生活，这些钱怎么来的？\n\n3、对世界影响不少。舍夫佐娃这次是精心准备。网传是她转走的是价值10亿美元的加密货币，这是有可能的，因为她的职务就是\"财务总监\"，对这些复杂的流程太熟悉了，而且都在她的权限范围内。\n\n如果一切属实，后果是严重的。因为舍夫佐娃对俄军事机密了如指掌，包括俄罗斯背后的支持者、军民两用产品的隐秘采购路径、俄伊两国合作的细节、经费等核心要事，很多是上不了台面的。",

Shevtsova, who has a significant military and advisory background, is noted for her high rank and extensive financial control within the ministry.

        "body": "台湾省出了个\"诸葛亮\"，军事才能顶呱呱，绿媒：台湾\"有救\"了\n\n台湾是中国不可分割的一部分，理应回归祖国的怀抱，实现祖国的统一，完成两岸人民的夙愿。\n\n然而，有一些\"台独\"分子却一直热衷于抹黑大陆，离间两岸的关系，妄想将台湾从中国的版图中分离出去，其中更是有一位典型的代表，让台湾绿媒称之为\"军事奇才\"，直呼台湾有救了。\n\n这位台湾\"诸葛亮\"究竟是谁呢？他做了什么才获得绿媒如此高的评价，他真的拥有\"拯救台湾\"的能力吗?\n\n加入国民党，支持两岸统一\n\n台湾绿媒所追捧的\"台湾诸葛亮\"，其真实姓名叫于北辰。\n\n于北辰在1968年出生于台北，但事实上他的祖籍在山东，他爷爷那一代是国民党，当年解放战争爆发后，国民党军队节节败退，以蒋介石为首的国民党残存势力逃到了台湾，他爷爷就是其中跟随的一员。\n\n年少时的于北辰拥有远大志向，充满了抱负，他的梦想就是成为一名军人，统领军队，掌管大权，为台湾的军事安全做出贡献。\n\n为了实现梦想，于北辰倾尽全力考入了台湾陆军军官学校，这是所久负盛名的军事学校，它的前身正是由孙中山一手创办的黄埔军校。\n\n1924年，孙中山在苏联和中国共产党的帮助下，在黄埔建立了陆军军官学校，后经改组成为了中央军事政治学校。黄埔军校以革命精神为指导，为当时的革命培养了不少人才，意义重大。\n\n从台湾陆军军官学校毕业以后，于北辰跟随爷爷加入了国民党，曾担任台湾陆军装甲兵542担任参谋长，最高官职为少将，也算是在军事领域取得了一番成就。\n\n在两岸关系的问题上，于北辰最初是强烈支持两岸统一的，这其中有两方面原因。\n\n第一，于北辰的祖籍在山东，是从爷爷那一辈开始才移居台湾的。从某种意义来讲，于北辰真正的故乡在大陆，而台湾仅仅是漂泊的他乡，所以于北辰对大陆具有一定的思念之情。\n\n第二，国民党早期的主张还是以支持两岸统一为主，严谨地说，至少他们对外界是这样宣传的，就连参加2024年大选的国民党候选人侯友宜，近期也频繁呼吁实现两岸的统一。\n\n因为上述两点原因，于北辰早期一直坚持促进两岸统一的观点。\n\n马英九时任台湾地区领导人，以及国民党主席，看中了当时能力突出的于北辰，而随着职位的提升，他掌握的权力也进一步增大，在军中也有了更多的话语权，同时在公众视野里也有了更多的曝光度。\n\n2017年，在接受公众媒体采访的时候，于北辰坚定地表示，两岸统一是历史发展趋势，他强烈支持台湾早日回归祖国的怀抱。\n\n于北辰身居要职，在台湾具有一定的影响力。在两岸关系紧张的时候，于北辰身为高官，坚定支持两岸统一，这得到了大陆人民的认可，于北辰随之进一步向大陆扩大影响力。\n\n于北辰频繁地出现在大陆的公众场合，参加了不少公众节目，并始终高调宣传和平统一的言论，让他收获了不少大陆粉丝，不少大陆人民都对他寄予厚望。\n\n后来，为了进一步扩大影响力，于北辰甚至聘请了专业的团队，建立了自己的YouTube账号，频繁发表和平统一的言论，又让他增加了不少海内外的粉丝群体。\n\n就当人们以为，于北辰会成为下一个支持两岸统一的代表性人物时，他却突然退出了国民党，态度也发生了巨大转变。\n\n因多种原因，退出国民党\n\n在退出国民党前，于北辰先选择了退役。\n\n于北辰选择退役的理由非常奇葩，他对外宣称自己的身体已经无法承担军队高强度的工作，他的心率已经下降到每分钟39次。\n\n从于北辰找的借口来看，就可以发现他的愚昧无知，成年人正常的心率水平在60~100次/分，倘若心率下降到39次/分，估计于北辰甚至都没有找借口退役的机会，直接住在医院了。\n\n于北辰的做法也从侧面反映了台湾军队的脆弱，台湾军队素来有\"草莓军队\"的笑称，就是因为他们的士兵接受不了高强度的训练，没有彰显军人的刚强。\n\n连于北辰这样的高级军官尚且如此，台湾军队的普通士兵又会好到哪里去呢？\n\n退役之后，于北辰凭借在军队的影响力，以及积累的人脉，谋得一个十分清闲的职务，他担任了黄国园党部的主任委员，这份工作薪资高，任务轻，地位高，深得于北辰满意。\n\n然而，政策的变化击破了于北辰安享余生的梦想。\n\n蔡英文担任台湾领导人期间，为了增加建设台湾的资金，蔡英文选择了\"节流\"的方式，军队薪资正是她重点削减的领域之一。\n\n于北辰对于蔡英文的政策十分不满，他好不容易才拼上了少将的职位，然后凭借前少将的身份谋得清闲又多金的工作，他多年的努力就因为一纸政策而白费了。\n\n或许是出于对蔡英文的不满，也或许是想要赚取更多的钱，于北辰从此开始了一系列\"骚操作\"。\n\n众所周知，台湾分为绿媒和蓝媒两大媒体。其中，绿媒是支持台独的一方，蓝媒则是支持统一的一方。\n\n因为于北辰先前支持两岸统一的言论，所以外界自然将他划分为蓝媒的阵营。削减军队薪资的政策出台后，于北辰便频繁接受绿媒的采访，参加绿媒阵营的访谈节目。\n\n当人们以为，\"蓝营\"的于北辰是想要在公众场合反驳\"绿营\"，谁知他却一改支持统一的言论，故意抹黑国民党，抹黑大陆，绿媒也十分喜欢邀请他，因为他\"蓝营\"的身份更加有说服力。\n\n就这样，于北辰在抹黑国民党、阻碍两岸统一的路上越走越远，国民党对于于北辰的做法十分不满，党的内部产生了众多舆论和纠纷，于北辰自知在国民党无法发展，便选择了退出国民党。\n\n退出国民党后，于北辰当了一段时间的无党派人士。在此期间，于北辰凭借\"前蓝营\"的身份，以及在YouTube积累的粉丝群体，继续频繁参加绿媒节目，逐渐转化为绿媒阵营。\n\n民进党一直以来都阻挠两岸统一，属于绿媒阵营。民进党看中了于北辰的影响力，便邀请他入党发展，于北辰也是欣然接受。\n\n加入民进党，愈发猖狂\n\n此前，虽然于北辰也在发表不利于两岸统一的言论，但并没有十分猖狂。\n\n身处国民党的时候，于北辰虽然对国民党不满，但毕竟需要忌惮一整个政党的实力，所以稍有收敛；作为无党派人士的时候，尽管没了政党的压力，但背后也缺乏势力撑腰，所以于北辰也没有太过放肆。\n\n但加入民进党以后就不一样了。民进党本身就属于绿媒阵营，一直以来都阻挠两岸统一，这和于北辰站在同一战线。\n\n其次，民进党有一个名为\"愚民政策\"的舆论战政策，主要内容就是向台湾民众传递大陆错误的信息，抹黑大陆，弱化大陆，让台湾民众有战胜大陆的信心，从而鼓动更多的台独分子。\n\n于北辰可谓是\"愚民政策\"的忠实践行者，他可是闹了不少造谣大陆的笑话。\n\n第一，著名的\"210%拦截率\"言论。\n\n于北辰在参加一档政治论坛节目时，被主持人问起\"天弓导弹的防空拦截率\"，于北辰丝毫不惧泄露台湾的军事机密，毫不遮掩地回答说：\"70%\"。\n\n但更令人震惊的还在后面，于北辰告诉台湾民众不必恐慌，因为大陆的导弹绝对无法抵达台湾，既然一枚导弹的拦截率是70%，那么三枚导弹的拦截率就是210%，就等同于绝对拦截。\n\n于北辰的言论让两岸人民都很无语。台湾人民指责他为什么要泄露军事机密，大陆人民则嘲笑他身为少将，却不懂基本的数学计算，闹出这样的笑话，可笑至极。\n\n第二，\"土房子\"事件\n\n同样是在参加政治节目的时候，于北辰就大陆的建设程度发表了自己的看法，他认为大陆的经济发展已经停滞，人们住的都是土房子，人们住在里面甚至还有被压死的可能。\n\n不得不说，于北辰真是把\"愚民政策\"贯彻到底，他不仅想要愚弄民众，甚至把自己都变傻了，中国大陆的发达程度全球皆知，台湾民众不是傻子，只是于北辰将他们当作傻子。\n\n于北辰的搞笑、愚蠢言论数不胜数，大陆人民往往看笑话，但这次的事件却也引起了台湾人民的愤怒。\n\n传递虚假消息的确是舆论战的有效方式，但舆论战的对象从来都是对外，用虚假信息迷惑敌人，而于北辰却是用虚假信息迷惑自己人，这让台湾民众感到非常不满。\n\n第三，挑战中国事件\n\n在俄乌战争发生的时候，于北辰迅速抓住了热点事件，他告诉台湾民众，乌克兰的军事实力仅仅在22位，就敢于挑战俄国，台湾的军事实力排在21位，挑战中国那不是轻轻松松。\n\n不得不说，一般人真的难以理解于北辰的思想，军事实力的比拼不能用数字来简单衡量，每一名都有着不小的差距，更何况中国掌握着核技术，台湾想要在军事上胜过大陆简直是天方夜谭。\n\n于北辰不仅对台湾的军事力量很自信，还对自己的实力很自信，他狂妄宣称，大陆上的任何一名军队将领和他单挑，他都会赢得彻彻底底，很难想象这是一个声称心率只有39/分，早早退役的无用少将。\n\n事实上，于北辰闹出的笑话还有很多，比如声称大陆的航母要48小时才能启动，大陆军队无法抵达台湾；还有让中国把疫苗交给日本，再让日本交给台湾，只有这样台湾人民才会接受......\n\n结语\n\n从强烈支持两岸统一的爱国人士，到故意抹黑中国、阻挠两岸统一的台独分子，于北辰生动诠释了什么叫虚伪，什么是贪图利益。\n\n尽管于北辰坚定贯彻\"愚民政策\"，但从效果来看，最终变得愚笨的只有他自己，他自己沦为了两岸人民的笑话，稍有理智的人就不会被他的花言巧语所欺骗。\n\n台湾绿媒就别逞强了，于北辰究竟是不是\"诸葛亮\"，两岸人民心知肚明。两岸统一是历史发展的大趋势，任何人都不可能阻止，违背历史潮流的人终将被时代淘汰，中国终会实现统一。",

        "summary": "The article discusses a Taiwanese figure, Yu Beichen, who was once praised by Taiwanese pro-independence media as a military genius akin to Zhuge Liang. Born in Taipei in 1968 with ancestral roots in Shandong, Yu initially supported the unification of Taiwan and China, influenced by his family's history and the early Kuomintang (KMT) stance on unification. He served in the Taiwanese military, reaching the rank of major general, and was a prominent advocate for unification during Ma Ying-jeou's presidency.\n\nHowever, Yu's stance shifted dramatically after retiring from the military and leaving the KMT. Discontent with policies under President Tsai Ing-wen, particularly those affecting military salaries, Yu began appearing on pro-independence media, criticizing the KMT and China. He eventually joined the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), adopting increasingly extreme and often absurd anti-China rhetoric, which has been widely mocked.\n\nThe article concludes by asserting that Yu's transformation from a unification supporter to a pro-independence figure highlights his opportunism and lack of genuine principles. It emphasizes that the unification of Taiwan and China is an inevitable historical trend, and those who oppose it will ultimately be marginalized."

        "summary": "In May 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin began a new term and subsequently replaced Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu, signaling a potential purge of the military's top ranks. Among those affected was former Deputy Defense Minister Tatiana Shevcova, who has reportedly fled to France with substantial assets. This move is speculated to have significant repercussions for Putin, as Shevcova possesses sensitive military information.\n\nShevcova, previously a high-ranking tax official, became Deputy Defense Minister in 2010, managing military finances and welfare. Her wealth includes luxury properties in Russia and Europe. Following Shoygu's dismissal, many anticipated Shevcova's removal, which occurred within two months. Russian media reported her seeking political asylum in France, raising concerns about potential security risks if she divulges military secrets.\n\nPutin's recent reshuffling of the Defense Ministry included appointing Anna Tsivileva, believed to be a close relative, as Deputy Defense Minister. This move is part of a broader effort to address corruption and inefficiency within the military, especially in the context of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. The appointments reflect Putin's reliance on trusted associates to implement his strategic objectives."

        "title": "社论：美国民主党陷入政治危机",
        "body": "美国总统拜登在首场选举辩论电视直播上表现失常，引发美国舆论和民主党内的激烈议论。拜登在辩论时显得口齿不清，偶尔甚至不知所云，让很多人怀疑年岁已大的他已有老人失智症状。许多民主党支持者和中间选民对此大感震惊，觉得拜登不适合继续执政四年，党内外要求他以大局为重退选的呼声陆续出现。但距离11月的总统大选投票日时间不多，阵前换将不仅兵家大忌，民主党还得面对众多党内选举程序和法律的障碍。非但民主党如今深陷政治危机，世界各国恐怕也对白宫主人的神志健全感到狐疑不定。\n\n白宫关于81岁拜登的认知健康状况，此前一直讳莫如深。在社交媒体上，拜登在辩论前的众多国内外不同场合，都出现过答非所问甚至不知所措的呆滞镜头。78岁的对手特朗普因而反复发出挑战，要求拜登接受体检。但白宫和主流媒体一再指责对手恶意中伤，强调拜登神志敏锐。辩论会直播却赤裸裸地让美国选民见证他年老体衰，反应迟钝的事实。辩论后最新公布的民调显示，72%选民认为拜登缺乏足够认知能力肩负总统重任，对民主党无疑是沉重一击，全党一时陷入群龙无首的危机状态。\n\n亲民主党的左派媒体如《纽约时报》等，已经用社论的高规格公开要求拜登退选。社媒上许多小道消息也盛传党内出现逼宫声浪。但一来民主党如今台面上缺乏众望所归的替代人选，几名被点名的州长潜在人选都不愿意表态，副总统哈里斯则不得人心；二来拜登已经取得党内初选资格，临时换将会面对众多党内民主和法律程序的障碍，难度不小。此外，对拜登影响最大的第一夫人吉尔，至今仍拒绝让拜登退选，党内大老如前总统奥巴马等还在公开支持拜登，增加党内换将的困难。\n\n在民主党之外，美国舆论最大的争议是，拜登所表现的认知健康问题，到底被隐瞒了多久？当下在幕后真正治理美国的三军统帅到底是谁？美国的民主是否出现问责空白？这就隐约涉及政治责任和伦理的宪政问题了。拜登的心智健康还牵扯出另一个关键疑问：美国民主机制的自我修复能力。乐观派时常提醒，万勿怀疑美国政治强大的纠错能力。但白宫主人的心智健康，加上目前角逐总统大位的两人均属高龄，美国政治\"蜀中无大将\"的窘境，是今年美国选民再无法回避的挑战。\n\n美国民主政治品质的堕落，也在这场电视辩论里暴露无遗。拜登与特朗普在辩论全程丝毫没有展现君子风度，辩论前后没有握手，也不正眼看对手，一副不共戴天的态势；而且辩论缺乏实质政策交锋，多次使用粗言鄙语，望之不似人君。特朗普不改夸夸其谈，自吹自擂的作风。拜登在辩论后也被有线电视新闻网（CNN）查证有不少不实之词，就差没指他撒谎，包括宣称任内没有任何美军丧命。共和党籍众议院议长约翰逊为此召开记者会，逐一念出因拜登仓皇撤离阿富汗时牺牲的13名美国士兵的名字。\n\n总统选举电视辩论的另一个直接后果，是极大地提高了特朗普二进宫的概率。CNN的即时民调发现，67%受访者认为特朗普更适合担任总统，比辩论前的55%增加12个百分点；只有33%认为拜登适任。左倾民调机构\"为进步之数据\"调查发现，八成美国人观看或阅读辩论报道，62%认为特朗普胜出，关键是有高达68%的中间选民这么认为。这意味着特朗普第二任期的可能性越来越大，美国的国内外政策或将发生重大改变。美国的盟友和对手因而都必须做好相应准备，国际局势也因此难免发生重大变化。\n\n作为世界头号强国，美国总统的认知健康无疑影响深远，特别是方兴未艾的俄乌战争、以哈冲突，乃至极可能爆发的以色列 -- 真主党战争，以及南中国海危机，都可能因为各方对美国总统健康的判断而出现新变数和动能，如不能排除个别势力或认为这场美国政治危机机不可失，决定铤而走险，导致更大的地缘政治动荡。因此，美国民主党的政治危机，对外牵动深广。华盛顿责无旁贷，必须尽快稳定人心，把各方误判的风险降到最低。",

        "summary": "The editorial discusses the political crisis within the U.S. Democratic Party following President Joe Biden's poor performance in a televised election debate. Biden's unclear speech and occasional incoherence have raised concerns about his cognitive health, leading to calls for him to withdraw from the race. The situation is complicated by the proximity of the November election and procedural and legal challenges within the party. The debate has significantly damaged Biden's image, with 72% of voters doubting his cognitive ability to serve as president, according to recent polls.\n\nLeft-leaning media outlets and social media are increasingly calling for Biden to step down, but the party lacks a clear alternative candidate. Key figures like former President Obama continue to support Biden, complicating any potential leadership change. The broader U.S. public is questioning how long Biden's cognitive issues have been concealed and who is effectively leading the country.\n\nThe debate also highlighted the decline in the quality of U.S. democratic politics, with both Biden and Trump failing to display decorum. Trump's chances of re-election have increased, with polls showing a significant rise in voter preference for him over Biden. This potential shift could lead to major changes in U.S. domestic and foreign policies, affecting global geopolitics, especially in regions like Ukraine, Israel, and the South China Sea.\n\nThe editorial concludes that the Democratic Party's crisis has far-reaching implications, necessitating swift action from Washington to stabilize the situation and minimize risks of misjudgment by international actors."

However, he noted that China's vision for the future differs from that of the U.S. and many other countries, prompting the U.S. to engage in intense competition with China to shape the future effectively.\n\nSpeaking at the Brookings Institution, Blinken discussed the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Palestine conflict, and competition with China. He emphasized the importance of international alliances in addressing shared challenges, citing China's investment in Russia's defense industry, which supports its aggression in Ukraine and impacts Europe significantly. He also mentioned that Asian partners are recognizing the global implications of such challenges.\n\nBlinken highlighted that China's actions contribute to global threats and stressed the need for the U.S. to manage its complex and crucial relationship with China. This involves standing firm on areas of deep disagreement while seeking cooperation in mutually beneficial areas, such as combating illegal fentanyl trafficking. He underscored the necessity of addressing each aspect of the U.S.-China relationship through competition, dialogue, and cooperation."

        "body": "地标产品羊肚菌赤松茸山珍土鸡汤上新！优选良种放养土鸡，以深山羊肚菌和赤松茸升华鸡汤风味营养，入口独特鲜香溢满口腔，简直太满足太高级了！上新特惠返利全抵价仅106.24元/罐到手，开通VIP(点蓝字进入）可专享抵或赠22%，全抵价99.84元/罐的会员价，点下图购\n\n法国变天，马克龙失算，欧洲要反转了！\n\n法国真的变天了！当地时间6月30日20时，法国国民议会选举第一轮投票结束。初步计票结果显示，在首轮投票中，极右翼国民联盟获得33%选票，得票率领先；左翼联盟\"新人民阵线\"获得28.5%选票，排名第二；而法国总统马克龙所在的执政党复兴党及中间派联盟\"在一起\"获得22%选票，位居第三。\n\n在欧洲政坛，执政的政党普遍都极端反极右翼势力，但在过去几年，欧洲极右翼势力不断抬头，这种抬头的格局在6月9日出现了重大变故，在当天的欧洲议会选举中，法国总统马克龙所在的复兴党在欧洲议会中赢得的席位远逊于法国极右翼政党国民联盟。对于这一结果，马克龙非常不满，当晚他就宣布解散国民议会，将原本2027年才举行的议会选举提前进行了。\n\n马克龙本来的想法是，通过解散议会重新选举来获得对法国议会的更多的主导权。然而，让他没想到的是，议会选举的结果反而是自己所在的政党惨败，自己强烈反对的极右翼成了最大赢家。可以毫不夸张地说，马克龙这次是彻底失算了！\n\n法国议会拥有577个席位，国民联盟目前仅89个席位，在首轮投票率创下1986年议会选举以来的历史新高69.7%后，根据首轮计票结果，法国民调机构埃拉贝进行了估算，预计极右翼国民联盟的议会席位将从89个暴增至260个至310个，如果国民联盟的席位真的达到了289席，那就意味和狗民联盟将控制议会。该调查机构还认为，左翼联盟\"新人民阵线\"预计将占据115至145个席位，马克龙所在的执政党复兴党及中间派联盟\"在一起\"将只占据90至120个席位。\n\n如果真是这样的结果，马克龙这个总统可就要被架空了！哪怕国民联盟达不到289个席位，只要达到200多个席位，也意味着在一会是第一大党，这虽然不会影响马克龙任期至2027年，但总理大位恐怕就要让给国民联盟了。目前来看，最有可能成为总理候选人的是国民联盟的主席、年仅28岁的乔丹·巴尔代拉。\n\n法国极右翼政党国民联盟在选举中获胜让很多欧洲国家的极右翼赶到兴奋，尤其是德国，现在极右翼势力也越来越获得选民支持，极右翼政党选择党联合主席爱丽丝·魏德尔在法国议会第一轮选举后就说，玛丽娜·勒庞领导的法国极右翼政党国民联盟在法国国民议会选举首轮投票中的胜利是个值得效仿的榜样。很显然，法国如此格局，德国也可能紧随其后。\n\n如此下去，未来极右翼势力有可能席卷欧洲，欧洲将因此可能出现全面大反转。\n\n极右翼势力为何突获青睐？对全球格局影响几何？\n\n很多人不明白，为啥欧洲极右翼势力突然获得了选民的青睐呢？其实，所谓的欧洲极右势力，是欧洲政坛给这类政党帖的标签。事实上，现在的欧洲极右翼实力并不是非常极端，原因是他们为了更好地发展，过去些年做了大量的改造。譬如，法国国民联盟的领袖勒庞，其父亲作为过于极端的力量就被清除出了国民联盟。\n\n与极右翼势力形成鲜明对比的是，欧洲过去的传统政党反而变得更加极端。譬如，像德国的绿党，表面上看是中间偏左，但实际上却非常极端。因此，所谓的极端不过是欧洲传统政党对这些过去为极右翼政党的贴得标签而已，真的评判起来，难讲谁更极端。\n\n那么，为什么极右翼势力现在突然获得了选民青睐的呢？主要是两个原因：\n\n一是西方保守主义的抬头。西方极右翼势力，本质上就是保守势力。近些年，随着大国博弈进行得越来越激烈，世界经济发展和地缘格局都发生了重大变化，各国民族主义、保守主义不断抬头，在这种大背景下，极右翼势力必然会受到更多关注和支持。\n\n二是执政党错会了民意。在过去俄乌战争爆发后的两年多时间里，欧洲向乌克兰援助了一千多亿欧元，但欧洲不但未能从战争中获利，反而因为切断了与俄罗斯的经贸往来导致能源价格飙升，欧洲经济因此遭到重创，这让欧洲人对俄乌爆发战争非常不满，尤其是不满意政府对俄罗斯的敌视政策。然而，在这样的背景下，像法国、德国等西欧国家的政府反而认为民意支持他们加强对乌克兰的援助。\n\n其实，说白了，极右翼在欧洲逐渐获得更大的支持，根本原因是大的国际形势背景决定的，也是经济环境决定的。\n\n那么，如果法国、德国最终真的都由极右翼执政，又会发生什么情况呢？\n\n如果极右翼逐渐在欧洲占据主动，很可能会发生两件事：\n\n一是欧洲自主能力将会大幅提升。如果法国极右翼掌握更多全力，德国也紧随其后，那么一旦欧洲主要由极右翼掌握权力，欧洲对美国的言听计从将会有很大改观，因为欧洲极右翼更主张外交自主。尤其是如果美国再是特朗普执政，那美欧的关系就会出现新的变化。\n\n二是俄欧关系可能缓和，乌克兰危机可能发生新变化。相比现在的法国马克龙政府和德国朔尔茨政府，法国和德国的极右翼一旦掌权，他们对乌克兰的军事援助就可能减少，俄乌战争就可能出现变化。而且，欧洲极右翼并不希望与俄罗斯交恶，这都意味着乌克兰危机有可能在美欧多国出现政府的执政结构变化后而出现重大变化。\n\n欧洲极右翼对华态度如何？\n\n毛主席曾经说过，他喜欢和西方的右翼打交道而不喜欢和西方的左翼打交道。毛主席为什么这么说？因为西方的右翼务实，而左翼往往是喜欢放空炮的白做，反而什么事都做不成。事实上，过去些年，大部分西方国家的右翼都相对务实，中国与其交往还能干点实事，反而是那些左翼，往往都是不干实事的嘴炮，这些嘴炮往往还反华，并通过反华这种意识形态来获得政治上利益。譬如，德国的绿党外长是中间偏左，结果她反华倾向非常明显。澳大利亚也是如此，自从其左翼上台后，中澳关系就陷入了泥沼，直到其左翼政党下台。\n\n因此，对于法德等欧洲国家而言，其极右翼上台不会对中欧关系造成负面影响，甚至很可能会因为极右翼上台而改善中欧关系。试想，极右翼是主张欧洲自主的政党，他们要想摆脱美国实现更多自主，就必须得依靠中国，进一步改善对华关系。而且，由于美国大选很可能是特朗普重新上台，到那时他会更加挤压欧洲，欧洲将可能会有更多极右翼上台，从而进一步改变欧洲内部政治的版图。\n\n对中国来说，西方国家谁执政其实是无所谓的一件事。因为，无论谁执政客观上都离不开与中国的合作，但斗争也会不断，只是多一点或少一点的问题，其本质不会有大的变化。就像美国，拜登和特朗普两个任期内对华有什么本质区别呢？其实，相比特朗普政府，拜登政府更加激进，不但发动了俄乌战争，还在南海、台海不断挑衅中国，甚至在为冲突做准备。这一切都决定了，我们并不需要在意谁会上台，因为他们都改变不了大形势。\n\n当然，如果像法国、德国等过都逐渐换成极右翼执政，我们中国反而可以把这种情况看成一次机会，一次重新梳理中欧关系，以及展开更加深度合作的机会。相比现在的欧洲主要国家的执政党，极右翼会更加务实，这更适合现在的中国状态。如果像法国、德国这样的极右翼政党希望开拓对华新的关系，那我们完全可以在原来基础上与其进一步突破，尤其是经济合作方面的突破应该对极右翼政党最具吸引力。\n\n谁能拒绝这一碗热乎乎又香喷喷的土鸡汤呢？汤色金黄鲜亮，看着就诱人；鸡肉口感紧实、酥嫩；再尝一口吸满汤汁的菌菇，Q 弹、爽滑、厚实，带着鸡汤的鲜美，即使再没胃口也能被那股鲜味勾出些馋意。鸡汤好喝鸡要好，它选用的是400 天以上原生态谷物喂养的良种土鸡，山间自由生长，通过传统工艺精心熬制，肉质不一般的鲜美，吃了才知道！上新优惠，返利抵或者赠17%，返利全抵价106.24元/罐到手，开通VIP(点蓝字进入）可专享抵或赠22%，全抵价99.84元/罐的会员价，点下图购\n\n土鸡汤里选用的是天然食材，羊肚菌、赤松茸源自深山，手工精心挑选，大小均匀，菌体饱满。其中的羊肚菌含有蛋白质、维生素、多糖和氨基酸等多种营养物质，低脂低碳。它柔嫩的口感、鲜美的味道、加上那独特的外形，让很多人吃了之后都念念不忘，在很多高端餐厅中都是招牌菜肴。加入鸡汤后呈现菌菇独特鲜香，香味馥郁。\n\n土鸡汤配料干净，不添加色素、香精、防腐剂， 4小时文火熬制， 121℃灭菌精炖锁鲜。罐装食用便捷， 想吃的时候加热8分钟左右，暖暖的鸡汤就好啦，香气扑鼻。上新优惠，返利抵或者赠17%，返利全抵价106.24元/罐到手，开通VIP(点蓝字进入）可专享抵或赠22%，全抵价99.84元/罐的会员价，点下图购",

        "summary": "The recent French parliamentary elections have resulted in a significant shift in the political landscape, with the far-right National Rally (RN) securing 33% of the vote, leading the first round. The left-wing New People's Ecological and Social Union (NUPES) came second with 28.5%, while President Emmanuel Macron's centrist coalition, Together, garnered only 22%, placing third. This outcome is a major setback for Macron, who had dissolved the National Assembly in hopes of gaining more control.\n\nThe RN's success marks a historic high in voter turnout since 1986, and projections suggest they could secure between 260 to 310 seats in the 577-seat assembly. If they reach 289 seats, they would control the parliament, potentially sidelining Macron's influence and positioning RN leader Jordan Bardella as a prime candidate for Prime Minister.\n\nThis shift has broader implications for Europe, as it may signal a rise in far-right influence across the continent, potentially altering EU dynamics and relations with the US and Russia. The far-right's pragmatic approach could also open new opportunities for China to strengthen economic ties with Europe, as these parties may seek more autonomous foreign policies less aligned with US interests."

        "title": "不接电话就是出事了！美防长紧急与俄防长通话，俄军已吃过三次亏_手机网易网",
        "body": "6月25日，乌克兰战争打到了第853天。70万俄军在上千公里的战线上激战之际，俄罗斯新防长别洛乌索夫应邀和美国防长奥斯汀打了一个电话。应邀也就是说，这个电话是美国方面发起的，主动者是美国。于是问题就来了：美国防长为什么要主动打这个电话呢？\n\n首先，这是证明给美国民众看，美国本土是安全的，别担心。华盛顿与莫斯科之间军事热线电话的存在，一直是两大军事强国相安无事的标志。然而，俄乌战争开始之前和俄乌战争开始最初的那段时间里，美国防长根本打不通俄防长的电话，也就是说，俄防长根本不接美防长的电话。和战斗的民族针锋相对近80年的五角大楼非常明白，莫斯科现在的黎明若总是静悄悄，那俄军肯定是在作妖。要知道\"不可预知性\"向来是俄军的软实力之一。\n\n二十多年前，俄罗斯积贫积弱之际，200人的俄空降部队就敢远程奔袭7000北约部队重重包围的科索沃机场。现在俄罗斯战车已经启动两年多了，70万俄军已经在乌克兰打红了眼，什么事干不出来。毕竟俄军是最讲究不在沉默中爆发，就在沉默中灭亡的。\n\n所以一直在背后操纵乌克兰战争的白宫，一直被俄罗斯人深深痛恨的五角大楼，必须要给美国人一个\"定心丸\"：俄军现在正面战场打得很顺，还有心情和五角大楼保持热线联系，说些不疼不痒的片汤话。这意味着俄美关系暂时是稳定且可控的，战争只发生在欧洲，不会威胁到美国本土。或者换句话更直白地表示，现在俄军还没有被逼疯，还在和美军讨价还价，还不会乱扔\"大炮仗\"。美国本土现在是安全的。\n\n其次，这是证明给北约中的欧洲各成员国看，俄罗斯对常规战争还心存侥幸，你们继续放手折腾俄军就是了。俄罗斯独自在乌克兰挑战常规力量数倍于自己的北约和美国开打代理人战争，底气自然是其三位一体的战略核力量\"大炮仗\"。一旦要么战争结束，要么毁天灭地。\n\n然而俄罗斯打俄乌战争是为了活下去，并不是不想活了，所以能通过常规手段解决的问题就不要用最极端的手段了。能用常规手段逼美国和北约退回1997，不用动用\"大杀器\"，莫斯科也是何乐而不为的。\n\n所以现在俄军故意拉长战线，在上千公里的战线上对乌军有生力量\"千刀万剐\"，有留地不留人的因素考虑，但也有演练俄罗斯铁血一代杀乌克兰敬欧洲诸国的意思。\n\n现在俄罗斯已有200多万经过乌克兰战火洗礼的铁血战士，欧洲各国想要继续群殴俄罗斯就要考虑和这200多万老战士玩命的代价。因此乌克兰战事越打规模越大，烈度越打越高之际，俄军也越打越凶，眼越打越红，欧洲各国心中的小鼓也就会越敲越响。\n\n所以北约峰会马上要开了，要给下一步的作战套路定性之际，美国防长出面套一套俄罗斯新防长的底牌，给北约跟欧洲成员国吃\"定心丸\"的意思就非常明显了。因为只要俄新防长接电话，那就意味着俄罗斯还理美国，还不想直接攻击美国本土。只要俄罗斯不攻击美国本土，欧洲各国就没有挨\"大炮仗\"的威胁，继续鼓励乌克兰和俄罗斯人拼人头就是了。\n\n最后，这是证明给乌军看，美军对俄军还是有威慑力的，乌军尽管放手打就是了。俄乌战争爆发之后，俄美两国防长共通了三次电话，每次电话之后乌军接受的军援力度都会加大，俄军所承受的损失就越大。\n\n2022年5月13日，美防长奥斯汀邀请俄防长绍伊古进行了俄乌战争爆发后的首次电话交流。当时从基辅撤军后的俄军正面战场推进顺利，不仅拿下了马里乌波尔，而且正在准备推进\"北顿涅茨克-利西昌斯克\"战役。然而双方的电话会谈结束之后，北约立即加大军援乌克兰力度，\"海马斯\"火箭炮一个月后正式在乌克兰战场亮相。乌军渐次从战争的蒙圈期走出，开始对俄军的远程打击彻底改变了乌克兰战场上的态势，打乱了俄军速战速决的计划，乌克兰战事开始呈现胶着状态，双方开展持久性的消耗战。\n\n2022年10月21日，乌军秋季突然发动的大反攻在哈尔科夫方向取得明显效果之后，俄军换帅，苏洛维金将军稳住俄军的阵脚，而且俄罗斯30万老兵的部分动员以及乌东四州入俄公投也顺利完成。美防长奥斯汀邀请俄防长绍伊古进行了俄乌冲突以来的第二次通话，再次探得俄军的底牌之后，20天之内乌军夺回赫尔松。一个多月后的12月5日，乌军第一次袭击俄部署战略轰炸机的恩格斯机场，拉开了俄本土被乌军规模性远程袭击的大幕。\n\n2023年3月15日，\"瓦格纳\"部队在巴赫穆特所打的\"绞肉机\"之战进行到关键时刻，美防长奥斯汀邀请俄防长绍伊古进行了俄乌冲突以来的第三次通话，名义上是讨论美军\"死神\"无人机在黑海被俄军战机击落一事，实际上仍然是稳定俄军躁动的心，劝俄罗斯安心地在乌克兰战场上挨打。结果三个月后，乌军不仅发动了筹谋已久的夏季大反攻，而且美国也开始批准射程超300公里的陆军战术导弹系统入乌作战。\n\n乌克兰战事越来越凸显双方拼人头比狠的特点。现在北约峰会召开在即，北约在今年下半年的对俄作战调子将定下来，乌军为了获得更多的北约军援，不仅在筹谋在哈尔科夫边境大反攻威胁俄罗斯本土的安全，甚至为了给F-16战机入乌参战，乌军加大了用美国导弹火箭弹对克里米亚和俄罗斯本土的远程攻击，以至于克里米亚的海滩都成为了乌军的攻击点。这种疯狂绝对是俄军难以接受的。\n\n因此，应当是为了让俄军的报复保持在可控范围之内，美国防长再次邀通了俄防长的电话。相信听到电话中传来俄防长别洛乌索夫声音的那一刻，美防长悬着的心就放了下来。别洛乌索夫说了些什么已经不重要，只要他拿起了电话，就说明现在的俄军还没有决定要在沉默中爆发。",

        "summary": "On June 25, the 853rd day of the Ukraine war, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin initiated a call with Russia's new Defense Minister, Belousov. This call, initiated by the U.S., aimed to reassure American citizens of their safety and demonstrate that U.S.-Russia military communication lines remain open, indicating stable and controlled relations. The call also served to reassure NATO members that Russia is still engaging in conventional warfare and not resorting to extreme measures, thus encouraging continued support for Ukraine.\n\nHistorically, such calls have led to increased military aid to Ukraine and significant Russian losses. For instance, after previous calls in May and October 2022, and March 2023, Ukraine received substantial military support, leading to key victories and shifts in the war dynamics.\n\nThe recent call comes as NATO prepares for its summit, aiming to set the tone for future operations against Russia. It also signals to Ukraine that the U.S. remains a deterrent to Russia, encouraging Ukraine to continue its offensive efforts. The call suggests that while Russia is intensifying its military actions, it has not yet decided to escalate to more extreme measures, providing a temporary sense of stability."

Recently, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a firm statement that Russia will not withdraw its troops from Ukraine, emphasizing that the only way to end the war is for Ukraine to be completely defeated. Putin's comments came during a press conference in Vietnam, where he accused Ukraine of using delay tactics and disrupting peace negotiations.\n\nPutin also addressed the issue of nuclear weapons, suggesting that Russia might adjust its nuclear policies in response to the West lowering the threshold for their use. However, he clarified that Russia currently sees no benefit in being the first to use nuclear weapons.\n\nWith 700,000 Russian troops positioned at the Ukrainian border, Putin believes Russia has the upper hand and is prepared to continue the conflict until Ukraine surrenders. He also indicated that Russia is not intimidated by potential Western or NATO intervention, hinting at the possible use of nuclear weapons if necessary. The article concludes by noting the increasing pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the growing concern among Western nations led by the United States."

India has ordered five S-400 systems, with three already delivered and deployed in central India, Gujarat, and Assam. The remaining two have been delayed due to the Russia-Ukraine war. To counter the threat from Pakistan's Northern Air Command, India redeployed the S-400 system from Gwalior to Adampur.\n\nIn response, Pakistan is considering deploying the FATAH-2 MLRS system to neutralize the S-400 threat. The FATAH-2, similar to the U.S. GMLRS, has a range of up to 450 km, capable of covering the Adampur base. The FATAH-2 was showcased at the IDEF-2023 exhibition in Turkey, with a reported range of 170 km and high accuracy. The system is believed to be an improved version of China's A-100 MLRS, first publicly displayed in January 2021."

        "body": "【袁红冰热点】（独家首发）惊爆习近平亲批：李尚福应处极刑！惩罚\"台独\"三份名单(视频)\n\n【看中国2024年7月1日讯】 （看中国记者李静汝采访报道） 旅居澳洲著名法学家、时常披露中共高层动向内幕的袁红冰教授，就中共最近对外发布的惩治所谓\"台独顽固分子\"《意见》，以及中共高调对外宣布开除连续两任国防部长魏凤和及李尚福的党籍军籍、并移送军事法庭审判的事件，日前向看中国记者独家爆料了这其中的相关内幕。\n\n中共出台关于惩治台独顽固分子的二十二条司法《意见》背景\n\n据悉，针对中共出台的惩治所谓\"台独顽固分子\"的《意见》，有外界评论认为，其严厉程度超过《国安法》，可以说是针对台湾的《国安法》。袁红冰对此首先指出：\"首先我们要看一下这份所谓司法《意见》它出台的背景。在2024年6月21日，也就是在台湾的国民党和白党两党立法院的党团，利用多数暴力强行通过毁宪乱政的国会五法之际，中共的国台办就召开了紧急会议。就是在这个会议上，中共最高法院、最高检察院和公安部、国安部、司法部等联合宣布所谓两院三部关于惩治台独顽固分子的二十二条司法《意见》。从这个时间的点上我们就可以看出，中共和台湾的蓝白两党沆瀣一气，隔岸呼应，内外勾连，制造台湾宪政混乱的这个阴谋，其实是已经昭然若揭。\"\n\n习近平为组长的中共中央对台工作领导小组发送三份名单征求意见\n\n袁红冰在采访中披露了日前中共红二代中反对习近平个人独裁的良知人士，冒着巨大风险传出的信息。\"在上述中共二十二条司法《意见》公布的第二天，也就是星期六的休息日，以习近平为组长的中共中央对台工作领导小组，就把三份名单送交到统战部、中宣部和中共国台办及其所属的各相关的政策研究机构来征求意见。在这三份征求意见名单的说明中特别指出，审查确定这三份名单是为了配合台湾岛内爱国统一力量在台湾立法机构也就是台湾立法院、以及在台湾的媒体舆论界打开突破性的新局面。\n\n这三份名单一份叫做准备新增加的台独顽固分子名单，一份是优先实施缺席审判的台独顽固分子名单，还有一份就是中共认为应当重点保护的台湾内部的人员名单。\n\n在第一份名单中，也就是新增加台独顽固分子的名单中，由中共中央对台工作领导小组指令中共国台办负责来拟定。在这份名单中已经初步确定了将要新确定的台独顽固分子名单主要集中在台湾的立法委员中，包括沈伯洋、吴思瑶、林楚茵。另外在这个名单中还着重征求意见，就是否应当把这个台独顽固分子的名单扩大到县市议员和非公职人员。在这个征求意见的名单中，包括桃园市的议员于北辰，还有台北市的议员简舒培、苗博雅。非公职人员中准备要新确定的这个台独顽固分子，排名在最前面的是两个人，一个就是曹兴诚，一个是王义川。在这份文件中还特别征求如果宣布赖清德是台独顽固分子、对中共统战和国际政治影响的厉害得失的意见，也就是把赖清德也列为台独顽固分子，对中共是否有利。这是第一份名单。\n\n第二份名单是第一批将要实施缺席审判的所谓台独顽固分子。中共在这份文件中着重指出，第一批实施的对台独顽固分子的缺席审判的目的，要聚焦在配合统战工作在台湾立法机构也就是立法院撕开的突破口，要有利于进一步扩大战果，力争能够更加有效的落实习近平总书记关于给民进党执政当局戴上无形的手铐和脚镣的指示。这份名单初步确定的第一批缺席审判的人员，有民进党总召柯建铭，另外新增加的台独顽固分子的名单如果得到确认之后，其中的民进党的立法委员沈伯洋、吴思瑶，还有两位没有公职的人士曹兴诚和王义川。这份文件还特别就一个问题来征求意见，就是对一些身处敏感政治地位的人员进行缺席审判是否对中共暴政有利？这些人员包括台湾的领导人，也就是台湾总统赖清德，还有用中共的话叫副领导人，实际上就是台湾的副总统萧美琴，国防部长顾立雄，国家安全委员会理事长吴钊燮，原来的立法院院长游锡堃，和原来的行政院院长苏贞昌等人。\n\n在这份中共中央对台工作领导小组下发到相关单位的文件中的第三份名单题目很长，叫做'运用惩治台独顽固分子司法意见的相关条例予以重点保护的台湾爱国统一人士的名单'。也就是要通过打击那些所谓的台独顽固分子，要达到重点保护某些人的目的。那么在这个名单中，有台湾的马英九，现在的立法院院长韩国瑜，国民党立法院总召傅崐萁，立委徐巧芯，马文君，高金素梅，洪孟楷等人。这份中共要着重保护的名单中，还包括学者和名嘴邱毅，郭正亮，赖岳谦，郑又平，游梓翔，介文汲，帅化明等总计30余名。\n\n凡是了解台湾情况的人都可以明白，中共想要重点保护的这些所谓的爱国统一人士，其实就是中共在台湾的在地协力者。据中共红二代中的良知人士通报，上述三份名单都是由台湾内部的中共协力者，通过特定人士直接送达中共国台办的。这足以说明台湾人民当前与投共卖台的台奸之间，在立法院和台湾的媒体舆论界进行的冲突，已经不是正常民主规则下的不同意见的合理的发布和合理的竞争。以马英九、韩国瑜、傅崐萁等人为代表的蓝营内部的投共卖台的台奸，乃是中共占领台湾立法院的先头部队。它的目的就是要借着无理的扩张立法权，来破坏台湾的民主法制，阻碍行政权的正常行使和运作。以赖岳谦、郭正亮、介文汲、游梓翔等为代表的投共卖台的台奸名嘴，则是中共占领自由台湾媒体和舆论阵地的登陆部队。他们进行认知作战的目的，就是在台湾内部散布恐共媚共的氛围，瓦解台湾军民保家卫国的战志。\"\n\n中共惩治所谓台独顽固分子的二十二条司法《意见》要达到的目的\n\n据外媒报道，北京方面强调将惩治\"台独顽固分子\"，\"不管身在何处都将一追到底\"。有外界评论，中国法院对台湾没有管辖权，所以并不清楚中国会如何在境外执行任何所谓\"惩治\"。袁红冰对此指出：\"只要去过台湾的人大家都会知道，相当长一段时间以来，中共利用自由台湾的言论自由、新闻自由、媒体自由的这个背景，充当中共中央大外宣和大内宣的喉舌，已经达到了极其猖狂的这个程度。台湾的有一些地方，比如说在傅昆萁家族长期掌权的这个花莲，在大街上你甚至能看到中国共产党的那个血旗。说明中共对台湾岛内的这种统战渗透，已经达到了极其危险的程度。\n\n而中共这次发布这个惩治所谓台独顽固分子的二十二条司法《意见》，它的最重要的目的之一就是从心理上为投共卖台的台奸撑腰打气。这是它的第一个目的。第二个目的，中共现在企图通过这样的一种宣布来表明他们的法律，已经可以适用于台湾。也就是根本无视一个基本的事实，就是中华民国台湾是独立于中共暴政的一个政治实体。它想要从国际社会的视线中抹去这样一个事实。这是它要达到的第二个目的。那它要想要达到第三个目的，就是它为最终军事入侵台湾之后，来清剿它们心目中的所谓台独顽固势力，预先做好司法准备。你看它这个二十二条意见，用台湾的一些评论的话叫做'包山包海'。在台湾的所有的社会的正常生活正常表达的意见，几乎都成为中共认定台独顽固分子的罪行。所以中共一旦军事入侵台湾取得成功之后，它就会依据这个专制恶法，对台湾社会进行大规模的血腥的镇压。这就是中共现在颁布这个二十二条司法《意见》所要达到的三个基本目的。\n\n我们大家都知道，中共暴政的所谓法律是专制恶法，这个法律存在本身就是一种罪恶。其实在法律的理论上早就有一种观念叫做'恶法非法'。面对专制恶法的时候，人们不仅没有服从的这个义务，而且有权利推翻专制恶法。所以如何推翻中共暴政的专制恶法，使中国人民变成自由人，拉开中国民主的历史大幕，这是14亿中国人现在急需要思考并付之于行动的重大的命运问题。\n\n那么，现在中共暴政不仅用它的专制恶法剥夺了、扼杀了14亿中国人的所有属于自由人的权利，它现在还想把它们的专制恶法扩展到世界各地，扩展到自由的台湾。所以说台湾最大的国家危险，来自中共吞并台湾的野心。但是台湾最紧急的国家安全隐患，则是来自台湾内部的这种各类各色的台奸。因此针对中共的所谓惩治台独顽固分子的二十二条司法《意见》，自由台湾急需制定惩治卖国台奸的特别法案，以清除自由台湾国家安全的心腹之患。中共暴政对自由台湾现在的威胁，可以说已经是如黑云压城了。\"\n\n中共红二代披露：习近平要拿李尚福人头祭旗？\n\n据悉，就在中共公布惩治台独顽固分子二十二条司法《意见》、声称要对台独顽固分子判处死刑还不到一个星期，中共又公开对外公布了对两任国防部长魏凤和、李尚福的惩处公告。对此袁红冰引述了中共红二代良知人士的通报、进一步披露了魏凤和、李尚福被整肃的实质罪名。\"有关惩处李尚福的公告，除了贪污腐败这一类风流罪名之外，实质上他的两项最致命的罪名，一个是中共所谓的严重违反政治纪律，一个也是中共所公布的就是严重违反组织纪律。\n\n李尚福的所谓严重违反政治纪律的罪名，在军队内部传达的时候，他的具体罪行指的就是，李尚福支持原国防大学政委刘亚洲上将的观点，暗中反对习主席和中央军委所确定的解决台湾问题的基本战略，大肆散布台海战争一旦爆发，我（共）军可能遭受前所未有的损失，甚至颠覆性损失等一系列祸乱军心、动摇战志的言论。李尚福的所谓严重违反组织纪律的罪名，在军队内部在传达的过程中，他的相关的具体的罪行是李尚福的个人政治野心膨胀，利用职权在军工系统内以及跨军兵种的范围内，肆无忌惮的拉帮结派、培植个人势力。以上的两项所谓的罪行，才是李尚福受到整肃的真正的政治原因。\n\n据中共红二代良知人士通报，习近平在中央军委关于李尚福问题的报告上的批示是这样写的：反党乱军、罪大恶极，应当处以极刑。据此，中共军内的人士认为，习近平必定会拿李尚福的人头来祭旗，从而开判处上将死刑而且立即执行的先例，以震慑军心。另一个前国防部长魏凤和，是李尚福的同谋犯，也是从犯，也将被判处死刑，缓期2年执行。\n\n我们从习近平狂妄的宣称要判处台独顽固分子死刑，到现在我们得到的信息，李尚福将被习近平判处死刑立即执行就可以看到，这两个表面上看来似乎互不相关的事件连接在一起的就是习近平的谋台战略。国际社会应该充分的认识到，习近平独裁统治之下，中共的基本国策，已经由邓、江时期的以经济建设为中心，转变成以共产极权主义全球扩张为中心，同时在搞乱台湾内部的前提下，中共的党卫军将军事入侵台湾。这个则是习近平极权主义全球扩张基本国策的核心而紧迫的战略想定。\n\n刚才我们已经讲了，习近平担任组长的这个中共中央台湾工作领导小组，在下发的那三份这个文件中，其实已经明确的指出中共下一段的全部的统战台湾的工作、统战台湾的活动，包括对台湾的渗透活动，都要围绕着配合台湾蓝白两党在立法院发起的这次这个事实上的登陆战进行。所以，如果还指望中共暴政能够维护台海和平的现状，那么这种指望本身就是一种愚蠢。所以包括美国在内的国际社会现在急需明确的认清，中共暴政一定要破坏台海的和平现状，中共暴政一定会发动台海战争，实现它的企图征服自由台湾的这个战略图谋。国际社会应当做的就是如何做好万全的准备，来反制中共的这种共产极权扩张的战略阴谋。\"\n\n北韩出兵乌克兰与中共图谋台湾\n\n袁红冰最后还分析指出，就最近媒体曝出的北韩出兵乌克兰其实也与中共谋台有着直接的关联。\"中共为了实现它的发动台海战争、吞并自由台湾的这个基本战略，它已经进行了全球的布局。重要一环就是要支持俄罗斯在俄乌战争中继续打下去。整个世界都看得很明白嘛，如果没有中共暴政的全方位的支持，俄罗斯根本不可能抵挡得住国际社会对它如此严峻的经济制裁。所以现在中共的所有的这个对外关系中的一个重要的核心内容，就是绝不允许俄罗斯在战场上失败。\n\n我们以前已经多次说过，无论是北韩向俄罗斯输送的这个军事装备，还是伊朗向俄罗斯输送的无人机技术，它背后实际上都是得到了中共暴政全方位的支持。那么这一次北韩派兵进入乌克兰，虽然表面上称作是什么工程部队，实际上就是一种变相的志愿军或者说变相的雇佣军，来补充俄罗斯在战场上的人员伤亡。那么中共支援北韩这样做的目的，就是为了把美国和欧洲的精力牵制在欧洲，使中共暴政一旦发起台海战争的时候，美国和欧洲无力顾及东亚地区，从而削弱美国和欧洲干预台海战争的意志和能力。\"\n\n(文章仅代表作者个人立场和观点)\n\n记者\"李静汝\n\n来源:看中国

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has issued a 22-point judicial opinion targeting \"stubborn Taiwan independence elements,\" which is seen as more severe than the National Security Law. The CCP has also expelled two former defense ministers, Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu, from the party and military, and they will face military court trials.\n\nThe article reveals that the CCP has circulated three lists for feedback: one for new Taiwan independence elements, one for those to be tried in absentia, and one for individuals in Taiwan to be protected. The lists include prominent Taiwanese politicians and public figures. The CCP's actions aim to support pro-unification forces in Taiwan and prepare for potential military action.\n\nAdditionally, the article discusses the broader implications of these actions, including the CCP's strategy to undermine Taiwan's democracy and the potential for increased military aggression. It also mentions North Korea's involvement in the Ukraine conflict as part of China's global strategy to distract the West and support Russia, thereby weakening Western intervention in East Asia."

        "summary": "The article discusses recent developments in China's stance towards Taiwan and internal political purges. Key points include:\n\n1. **Judicial Opinions on Taiwan Independence**: China has issued 22 judicial opinions targeting \"stubborn Taiwan independence elements,\" which are seen as more severe than the National Security Law. This move follows Taiwan's legislative changes by the Kuomintang and White Party, suggesting collusion between these parties and the Chinese government.\n\n2. **Leadership and Lists**: Xi Jinping's Central Committee for Taiwan Affairs has circulated three lists for feedback: new Taiwan independence elements, those to be tried in absentia, and individuals in Taiwan to be protected. These lists include prominent Taiwanese politicians and public figures.\n\n3. **Punishment of Former Defense Ministers**: Xi Jinping has reportedly approved the death penalty for former Defense Minister Li Shangfu, citing severe political and organizational discipline violations. Another former Defense Minister, Wei Fenghe, is also implicated and may face a death sentence with a two-year reprieve.\n\n4. **Strategic Implications**: The article suggests that these actions are part of Xi Jinping's broader strategy to assert control over Taiwan and suppress dissent within the Chinese military. It also highlights the potential for increased military aggression towards Taiwan and the need for international preparedness.\n\n5. **North Korea's Role**: The article links North Korea's involvement in Ukraine to China's strategy, suggesting that China supports Russia to distract the West and weaken its response to potential Chinese actions in Taiwan.\n\nThe article emphasizes the urgency for Taiwan to address internal threats and for the international community to recognize and counter China's expansionist ambitions."

        "body": "刚刚看到一个大新闻：拜登决定退出竞选。\n\n我查了一下，这个消息的源头来自BillOReilly新闻总部的\"独家报道\"，说是拜登经过与家人和关系亲密者的商谈后，决定退出2024总统竞选，云云。\n\n这当然是无稽之谈了，事实恰恰相反，拜登得到了家人和民主党高层的一致支持，他不可能退选。并且我认为，除非在接下来几个月中拜登的健康状况出现了大问题，否则他将赢得这场选举。\n\n原因很简单，美国人民不喜欢拜登，但他们更讨厌川普。\n\n这个事情我说过很多次，最近的一次前两天，在电视辩论之后发的那篇短文：\"拜登：输了辩论又如何？\"。当时我曾经说过，\"这场辩论既无法撼动拜登的铁杆支持者，也难以让中间选民转向川普。就像观察家们所说，辩论会结束后，唯一可以确定的是，厌恶双方的选民都增加了\"。\n\n事实也的确如此。\n\n益普索（全球领先市场研究集团）的最新调查显示，辩论后美国选民对拜登和特朗普的看法几乎没有改变，46.7%的选民准备投票给拜登，而43.9%的选民支持特朗普。\n\n当然，最终拜登仍有可能输掉这场大选，尽管概率比较低。\n\n因为他实在太老，太迟钝了。如果换一个对手，他半点机会都没有，就像《时代周刊》在电视辩论结束后的这个经典的封面暗示的这样。\n\n那么，如果川普当选，会怎么样呢？\n\n首先，对于俄乌战争，我认为他不会让俄罗斯赢 -- -- 注意，是\"不让俄罗斯赢\"，而不是让俄罗斯输，这是他和拜登的区别。\n\n川普在电视辩论中表示，\"他不接受普京提出的结束战争的条件，其中包括俄罗斯保留领土主张和乌克兰放弃加入北约\"。\n\n我不认为这是一句谎言。\n\n但川普显然并不愿意长期支持乌克兰作战，这是一定的。因而他非常可能使用其所擅长的极限施压，让双方各退一步：乌克兰肯定会付出部分领土（虽然不会像普京要求的那样多），俄罗斯则可能不得不接受乌克兰加入北约。\n\n俄罗斯会答应吗？我认为会。\n\n我从不认为\"乌克兰不加入北约\"是普京的底线，挪威、波兰、波三小、芬兰、瑞典，北约早就在俄罗斯的家门口了，只要川普在乌克兰被占领土上给出一个妥协方案，普京完全可能会见好就收。因为他知道，如果特朗普也铁了心支持乌克兰，俄罗斯最后什么也得不到。\n\n那么乌克兰呢？\n\n我只能说泽连斯基和他的团队（民众的反应下次再聊）肯定不会接受，他们会在欧洲的支持下继续战斗。\n\n至于说\"欧洲强硬派会抢在川普上台前出兵乌克兰，造成北约参战的既成事实\"，我认为绝无可能。\n\n不管是杜达还是马克龙，都不可能大手一挥，派兵出乌克兰\"保家卫国\"，因为这样做必定会招到民众的反对。\n\n我知道这样说支持乌克兰的朋友会不高兴，但事实上除了部分理想主义者，没有人会愿意自己的加入这样一场残酷的战争。\n\n没办法，人性就是如此。\n\n人类历史上那些乌托邦的失败，正是由于拒绝承认人性中\"私\"的一面，同样的道理，在俄乌战争这件事情，你也不能只谈道义。\n\n因此，我坚持认为，除非俄军跨过第聂伯河，入侵乌西，对欧洲形成现实的威胁，否则欧洲国家不可能出兵 -- -- 实际上马克龙多次关于出兵的讲话，表达的就是这个意思。\n\n至于东大，无论川普还是拜登，差别只在于战术层面，总的战略不会有什么不同。对东大而言，变量在欧洲。\n\n前些天，乌克兰外交部长库莱巴对东大负责欧洲事务的特别代表表示，\"应从双边角度和从乌克兰未来加入欧洲联盟的角度战略性地看待两国关系的重要性\"，正是直击了这一要害。。。",

However, this claim is baseless. In reality, Biden has the full support of his family and Democratic Party leaders and is unlikely to withdraw unless significant health issues arise. Polls show Biden slightly leading over Trump, with 46.7% of voters supporting Biden and 43.9% supporting Trump.\n\nThe article also speculates on the potential outcomes if Trump were to win the election, particularly regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It suggests that Trump would not allow Russia to win but would likely push for a compromise, potentially involving Ukraine ceding some territory while joining NATO. The article doubts that European countries would intervene militarily in Ukraine unless there is a direct threat to Europe.\n\nIn summary, the article debunks the rumor of Biden's withdrawal, highlights the current electoral landscape, and discusses potential geopolitical implications of a Trump presidency."

        "body": "6月27日，美国两党推定总统候选人拜登和川普（特朗普）进行了大选前的首场辩论，引发各方的评头论足。不少华人应该颇有感触，事关中国老百姓生活的政策何时也能公开辩论呢？号称领导中国的中共高层也敢这般公开亮相吗？中南海一直在梦想着美国式的强大，怎奈实在学不来，而这也正是中共政权衰败的必然。中国人越来越看清了这一点。\n\n民意决定谁能做世界上最有权势的人\n\n拜登和川普都想通过此次辩论，争取更大的民意支持。美国总统常常被称为世界上最有权势的人，不过要赢取这一职位，必须得到美国选民的认可。候选人必须关注选民真正在意的话题，拿出有效的政策，否则选民不会买账。\n\n在中国大陆，中共以谎言、暴力拼命要维系一党专政，中共高层真正关心的只是如何压制民意，如何在内斗中千方百计地置政敌于死地，从而确保自己手中的权力和利益。因此，中共从上到下的官员们都不在乎民生、民意，他们不相信\"水能载舟亦能覆舟\"，当然更不相信天意。\n\n中共大小官员们很愿意找\"高人指点\"，但不是为了顺天意、民意行事；相反，他们为了能继续升官发财，往往还会逆天意而行，任意残害百姓、鱼肉百姓。\n\n美国大选辩论，各国都在关注，中南海也在关注，但中共高层绝对不会模仿，他们假意称\"为人民服务\"，甚至号称权力是\"人民给的\"；但他们始终都极力防止把权力交还给人民。\n\n中共官员们绝不敢把自己的无能展现在公众面前，更不能让老百姓知道他们实际只会念稿；假如也搞类似的辩论，中共高层只会丑态百出、不知所云，恐怕个个都得下台。\n\n中共江河日下，面对内外矛盾重重，中南海仍在试图掩盖自己的无能，千方百计地打压异音。然而，这并不能改变中共政权急速衰败、灭亡的命运；中南海一次次无奈地挣扎，都只会让脖子上的绞索套得更紧而已。\n\n中美老百姓都想过上好日子\n\n美国是世界第一强国，在诸多国际事务上发挥着领导作用，但美国选民首先关心的是自己的日常生活，经济是拜登和川普辩论的一大焦点话题。\n\n通货膨胀导致物价升高，美国人想维持同样的生活标准，不得不支出更多。选民的这种感觉对现任总统拜登不利，川普则在这个问题上采取攻势；但选民也会衡量，川普是否能做得更好。\n\n老百姓想过好日子，而且希望越过越好；很多美国选民现在似乎感觉不到。\n\n中国老百姓恐怕感触更深。近年来，中国没有明显的通货膨胀，往往还被称为通货紧缩，意味着经济活动在萎缩。中国大陆的失业者越来越多，最突出的是年轻人，包括刚刚毕业的大学生，很难找到工作。企业在倒闭、裁员，公务员都被减薪，消费不断降级，中国经济陷入恶性循环。中共高层束手无策，还连出昏招，对内打击民营企业，对外四处树敌，导致供应链加速外移，科技被卡脖子。\n\n如果按照民意，中南海里的人早就该下台了，但他们不愿下台，反而还要保党、保政权、保个人权位，变本加厉地高压维稳。他们表面上还在演戏，但内心越来越惶恐，恐怕也知道时日无多。\n\n经济全球化、民营企业的迅速发展，让中国经济过去几十年大幅增长，中共政权才得以继续存在；但大量财富被中共权贵搜刮，特权阶层不可能主动放弃特权，民营企业举步维艰。中共不可能允许市场经济，否则就失去了控制权，更没有了贪腐的机会。\n\n中共没有办法挽救经济，困境中的中国人在觉醒、在寻找出路，中国的变革已蓄势待发，中共退出历史舞台实属必然。中南海当然不愿面对公众的质疑，更不会搞美国式的辩论，但也改变不了下台的命运。\n\n本国人民需要首先得到关照\n\n拜登和川普辩论的另一大议题是非法移民。辩论之前，拜登出台了限制非法移民入境的措施。显然，拜登也知道非法移民激增会危害本国国民的利益，包括抢夺工作机会、分流有限的社会福利资源、导致社会治安问题等。\n\n川普2016年竞选时，就对非法移民问题进行了猛烈抨击，并获得了很多选民的支持，这也是他成功当选的重要因素之一。他还曾提出了\"美国优先\"，即本国人民需要首先得到关照。\n\n在这一点上，拜登也不敢怠慢，为了对抗中共的倾销，他保留了川普曾全部加征的对华关税，今年还专门针对中共的电动车出口等\"新三样\"加征最高100%的新关税。拜登也推动了《芯片法案》，布局芯片的美国生产线。这些做法都在努力保留美国工作机会，确保供应链安全。\n\n川普和拜登还会继续向选民展示自己关照本国国民的政策。这一点对中南海来说是无法做到的，中共高层不断四处调研，但根本没有在关注民生，只是在作秀。中国南方正持续发生水灾，中共高层与往年一样，至今没人到灾区视察、慰问。\n\n眼看外资撤离、外国人不愿到中国，中共单方面宣布对一系列国家实施免签，指望吸引外国人来华，但多数国家没有对等给中国公民免签。中共的做法可以说是丧权辱国，若是别人这样做，早就会被中共挂上\"崇洋媚外\"的标签。\n\n然而事与愿违，美国人、日本人相继在中国遇刺，中共的把戏不灵；只好用\"偶发事件\"搪塞，照例对内封锁消息，但对外封锁不了。中南海用对内维稳的模式对待涉外事件，但中国以外的人不会认可。中共对本国人民都不在乎，更不会在意中国以外的人。\n\n中共从未真正关照过本国人民，中国老百姓轻则被视为韭菜，重则随时可能被当作活摘器官的供体。这样邪恶的政权倒台只是时间问题，越折腾倒台就越快。\n\n外交能力的高下\n\n拜登和川普都希望证明自己处理国内问题的能力，也想证明自己更擅长处理外部事务。各国关注这场辩论，也正是因为美国有实力影响国际事务的方方面面。\n\n中南海时常标榜参与\"全球治理\"，实际没有多大影响力。中共高层不允许公众讨论外交问题，也不允许大多数官员讨论，更别说辩论了。至少过去5年来，中共外交迅速萎缩，所谓的\"大国外交\"惨不忍睹。\n\n2024年眼看过去一半，中共党魁唯一访问的大国只有法国，G7峰会更是摸不着边。中共与美国、英国、加拿大、日本全面交恶；德国、意大利有意疏远中共；法国总统马克龙当面要求中共党魁承诺不向俄罗斯提供武器，并坚定与美国站在一起。中日韩首脑峰会本是一个改善关系的机会，中共却仅派出不是二号人物的李强参加。\n\n李强随后又访问新西兰、澳大利亚，但他应该只能念稿，还不能接受记者提问。李强在夏季达沃斯论坛上表示，对中国经济不能下猛药，结果被中共党媒封杀。中共总理的头衔显然越发没有份量了。\n\n中共高层执意与美国对抗，不断散布反美宣传，中共官员们几乎都知道反美是死路一条，但没人敢说中共党魁错了。\n\n拜登和川普辩论如何解决俄乌战争；中共为了反美，选择支持俄罗斯继续消耗战，继而与北约、欧洲为敌。美欧提出中共的出口倾销和产能过剩问题，中南海强词夺理，最终换来了美欧的高关税。\n\n中共在外交上一错再错，中共高层还拼命在捂盖子，生怕内部的质疑。中共缺乏对抗美国、西方的本钱，中南海更极度缺乏对外打交道的能力。中共败坏了中国的国际形象，无端造成了中国人民利益的损失，把中国引向了歧途。中共代表不了中国，代表不了中国人民，更没有资格领导中国。\n\n6月28日，中南海再次作秀，在北京人民大会堂举办\"和平共处五项原则\"纪念大会。中共党魁高喊\"和平\"的当日，中共军舰却再度穿越日本岛屿间的狭窄海峡，中共也继续对台湾同胞咬牙切齿。\n\n中共此时对外喊话\"和平共处\"，实际深感内外危机难解，既怕内部再次生乱，又怕外部的持续打击。中共党魁的讲话仍然称\"反对搞阵营对抗\"和各种\"小圈子\"，反对\"强迫别国选边站队\"。\n\n中共实际在对美国和西方喊话，但拉来捧场的外国政要却仅有少数几个国家的前总统、前总理。西方各国已经再难与中共\"和平共处\"，中共的\"大国外交\"如今只剩下了喊话外交。\n\n结语\n\n美国为什么能成为世界第一强国？关注美国总统选举辩论的华人应该都多少知道了一些答案。美国总统、联邦众议员、参议员、各州州长和议会的产生，都要经过类似公开透明的竞选；美国经济活动更是充满市场竞争、创新不断；美国的各项职业体育赛事，同样因为竞争激烈而精彩纷呈，一直吸引着庞大的体育迷。\n\n中共一直高喊\"强国\"，如今越来越多的人也知道了为什么中国难以真正成为强国；因为1949年以来，一帮庸才、蠢才为了特权，始终霸占着中南海。中共治下的一切都是暗箱操作，生活在中国大陆的人很难获得公开、公平的竞争机会。\n\n中南海的精力都用在了如何维系一党专政、如何保住个人的权位；他们不懂治国，也不关心老百姓的生死；他们不能解决问题，却专门解决提出问题的人；甚至没人提出问题，他们若认为谁有问题，照样不会放过。\n\n6月27日，中共政治局开会宣布处理李尚福、魏凤和两任防长。这两个花瓶式人物的倒台，是中共二十大以来又一次招牌式的挫败。当天政治局还在学习\"全面从严治党\"，然而这个党已经没治了。\n\n本文只代表作者的观点和陈述。\n\n（转自大纪元/责任编辑：刘明湘）\n\n本文网址: https://www.ntdtv.com/gb/2024/07/01/a103893729.html",

It criticizes the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for its lack of transparency and public accountability, suggesting that the CCP's reliance on lies and violence to maintain power is leading to its inevitable decline. The article emphasizes that while American leaders must address voters' concerns to gain support, Chinese leaders focus on suppressing dissent and maintaining their own power. It also points out the economic struggles in China, including high unemployment and failing businesses, and criticizes the CCP's ineffective policies. The article concludes that the CCP's inability to genuinely care for its citizens and its poor handling of both domestic and international issues will lead to its downfall."

        "title": "战火硝烟下，我在乌克兰住防空洞的日子",
        "body": "战火硝烟下，我在乌克兰住防空洞的日子\n\n两年多过去了，俄乌战争还在继续。\n\n有很多人回到了乌克兰的首都基辅，据国际移民局2023年5月的统计数据，已有480万乌克兰人返回了故土，基辅的人口已逐渐恢复到了战前的水准。\n\n从社交媒体上看，基辅似乎看起来跟其他的欧洲城市没什么差别，大街上人来人往，有说有笑。\n\n汶奇在2023年8月份重返了基辅，他体会到了基辅的变与不变。每次走在街上，只要不刻意地去想跟战争相关的事情，他就觉得跟平常一样。\n\n但防空警报每天都在响，尤其喜欢在半夜响起，声音就像盘旋在上空的110出警铃声。偶尔，汶奇会听到室外的爆炸声，他形容那种声响像是来自低云层的雷声。\n\n这两个月来，汶奇第一次在基辅经历大规模的停电。俄罗斯的空袭摧毁了基辅最大的发电站，而紧急从邻国\"借\"来的电并不能满足庞大的人口所需。\n\n我们第一次通话是在5月底，当时汶奇住在基辅的学生宿舍，一天有时停电3、4个小时。到了6月初，我们第二次通话时，他住进了本科导师在基辅州乡下的房子，有时一天只有两三个小时有电，且不知道来电的准确时间。\n\n因此，我们没法约定具体的访谈时间。到了约定的日期，基辅时间下午一点多，他终于联系上我。他的原话是，\"现在来电了，但可能半小时左右停电\"。时间远远不够，我只能听天由命。万幸，当天我们聊了两个小时，汶奇才打断我，\"这里快停电了\"。\n\n其他的一些改变是，重返校园后，这里冒出了很多汶奇不认识的新面孔。而大部分他熟悉的面孔，有的上战场，有的出国，一切好像都回不去了。\n\n去乌克兰留学，是汶奇过往的人生中做过最勇敢的一个决定。原本，他应该按父母的期望，在国内念一个大学，毕业后就进体制内单位的。可战争将他一切的计划都打断了，他被迫回国，甚至还休学了一年。\n\n2023年8月，我准备从上海出发回基辅，继续我中断的本科学业。\n\n我是上大二那年，这边开始打仗的。之后，虽然所有课程都转到了线上，但像我们学大提琴的，上网课很不方便，也没啥效果。很快，我就跟另一个同学一起休了学。\n\n我原本计划着先在国内等，战争一结束就回基辅继续上学。可我休学了一年后，战争还是没结束，我不想再这样耗下去。当时，我身边也有一些留学生回到了基辅，当地的情况似乎还是比较乐观的。最终，我下定决心要回去上学。\n\n出发当天，我是从上海先飞土耳其的伊斯坦布尔，第二程再飞摩尔多瓦，最后从摩尔多瓦坐大巴入境乌克兰。战争期间，乌克兰是没有制空权的，没有哪个航空公司敢进到这里的领空。因此，都得从邻国坐火车或大巴进乌克兰。\n\n从摩尔多瓦入境乌克兰基辅的大巴车\n\n除了摩尔多瓦，还有不少跟乌克兰接壤的国家，比如波兰、罗马尼亚等。但这些都是欧盟国家，签证审查比较严，不如摩尔多瓦的好办。2022年俄乌战争爆发那次，我是从波兰回的国。当时，波兰政府就给了我一个过境签。\n\n上海飞的航班是晚上的，到摩尔多瓦是第二天中午左右。我当时纠结要不要在当地住一晚？\n\n我当时心里很忐忑，听说很多朋友都被海关给劝返回国了。于是我四处打听，问朋友他们是怎么走的，怎么弄，去哪儿订大巴？最终，一位乌克兰本地的朋友直接给我订了大巴票，我咬咬牙当天就出发了。\n\n出发的大巴车上，只有两个外国人，除了我，还有一个\"印度老表\"。其他的，要么是乌克兰人，要么是摩尔多瓦人。我听说摩尔多瓦有一些亲戚在乌克兰，他们之间可能会相互拜访。\n\n整辆车，也只有我俩是青壮年男性，其余的要么是老年人，要么就是妇女。在乌克兰，征兵年龄段以内的男性，是出不了境的。除非是货运司机，或者你能拿出其他的证明文件。\n\n过摩尔多瓦海关是第一关，我身边很多朋友都是好不容易从摩尔多瓦坐大巴到边境，结果却被海关遣返回国了。\n\n遣返的理由有很多，战争期间，没有正当理由海关是不会放行的。就算是来念书的，还需要乌克兰的学校给这边的海关发邮件或打电话，说明学校的哪个同学需要回来。\n\n可即便学校打了电话、发了邮件，具体还得看当地海关放不放你进。对那些准备在乌克兰入学的新生来说，只有学校的邀请函或签证，没有当地的居留证，拒签率几乎是100%。我还听说，有学校老师直接开车去海关，想接学生进，都接不进来。\n\n我是战前就在乌克兰，也办了当地的居留证，因而幸运地被摩尔多瓦海关放行了。过乌克兰海关是第二关，我还记得凌晨两点左右，我已经睡着了。有一个拿着手电筒，扛着枪的女军警走上车，拍了拍我说，收护照。\n\n等我的护照被拿回来时，司机大哥顺口问，这是哪个国家的护照。他们得知我是中国人后，都很意外，觉得中国人怎么会在这个时间点来呢？在此之前，他们都以为我是印度人，我当时的肤色也很\"印度\"。我是云南的，当时被晒得黢黑，搞得\"印度老表\"一上车就热情地问我是印度哪个城市的？\n\n车里只有我们两个外国人，过海关时，司机很怕我俩的证件出问题，耽误事。当时，我想下车去上厕所，可厕所只有乌克兰海关里有。必须得等上一个人回来，下一个人才能接着去上，有点像小学上课（要上厕所）一样。\n\n我刚想下车，司机就嘱咐我，\"你别上了，你如果上完赶不上车怎么办？护照检查没事就赶紧走吧\"。\n\n我们的大巴车是从西边入境乌克兰的，到基辅时，天已经亮了。\n\n大巴车经过的第一个点就是我第一次来乌克兰住的地方，接着，我又路过了第二个住过的公寓，第三个住过的房子，一直到终点站。\n\n我的鼻腔有点发酸，感觉关于战争的一切就像一场梦，梦醒了，基辅的一切都没有变，时间也停留在了那个最美好的时候。\n\n我盯着那些房子看得发呆，房子还是那个房子，但房子里的人呢？朋友们在社交媒体上发布的照片提醒我，他们已经上战场了。我跟他们的聊天记录大多停留在战前。这一切都不是梦，已经回不去了。\n\n战争的蛛丝马迹\n\n我每次走在基辅的街上，只要不刻意去想战争的话，就觉得跟平常一样。这大概是因为，在基辅，路面的修缮一直在进行。哪怕可能一炸就没了，但该有的还是要有。\n\n除了偶尔会在街上看到那种拦截坦克的\"捷克刺猬\" -- -- 这是战争留下来的，平时会放置在马路旁边，我的思绪才会被拉回到战时。\n\n防空警报基本每天都会响，尤其是在夜里。在夜里，我通常会刻意不让自己睡得太死，但实在太困我也控制不住。理论上，只要防空警报一响，就需要跑去防空洞。\n\n在基辅市区，拍下的防空导弹轨迹图\n\n但我一般都是防空警报一响，第一时间看群里的新闻。如果新闻里说的是\"无人机轰炸\"，那么我就接着睡。对付无人机，基辅的防空系统还是绰绰有余。\n\n如果新闻里说\"轰炸机来袭\"，那么我就要让自己清醒起来，有可能会去防空洞。可如果新闻里说\"战斗机或导弹已经发射了\"，那么我就会毫不犹豫跑去防空洞。\n\n不同的导弹，留给我们的逃生时间还不一样。比如\"高超音速导弹\"，逃生时间就只有10～15分钟。如果是\"巡航导弹\"，逃生时间就会有半个小时。所有的这些信息，实时新闻里都会写明。\n\n重回基辅的第一天，本地同学就给我手机装了好几个防空警报的软件。一旦有空袭，它们就会来轰炸我的耳朵，就跟那些老人机似的。\n\n回想战争刚爆发，第一次响防空警报时，我还毫无感觉。当时，我连觉都没睡醒，就被我室友摇起来说，打仗了。我以为我在做梦呢？\n\n很快，我觉得好像空气里都有股火药味。我第一次有那种未知的恐惧，觉得一旦暴露在外，可能瞬间我这人就没了。不知道什么时候来颗导弹，我人就挂了。\n\n打仗的第一天，大家就老老实实待在防空洞里。因为不知道外面什么情况，我们只能在手机上看新闻，过一会儿就越看越毛 -- -- 一开始说只是导弹轰炸，到后面就说什么地面部队已经向基辅进发了。\n\n战争爆发时，躲在防空洞的汶奇与他的同学们\n\n到了第二天、第三天，大家就慢慢松懈下来，就觉得这个事既然已经发生了，那也没办法，然后就开始该做饭做饭。\n\n那几天，中国留学生天天聚在一起做饭，我最记得北方的同学在那包饺子，南方的就在那炒菜。平时，大家都是几个土豆胡乱了事。一打仗，大家是能吃多好吃多好，弄得热火朝天，就跟过年了似的。\n\n管你防空警报响不响，我们就在宿舍上面做我们的饭。搞得乌克兰人都很诧异，都什么时候了，这些中国人还有心情做饭？\n\n事后回想，啼笑皆非。我觉得这也跟我们这些人从没经历过战争，觉得战争只在电影、电视剧或游戏里存在一样有关。\n\n反观我的乌克兰同学，本地学生能走的都走了，不能走的，他们也是一响防空警报，立马去防空洞。他们做饭要么是在防空洞里做，要么就在宿舍做好了，然后端到防空洞吃。不像我们，只有听到外面爆炸了，才吓得赶紧去防空洞躲一躲。\n\n汶奇拍下的刚开战时的基辅vs第二次回来时的基辅\n\n当时，本地学生的心情也跟我们不太一样。我记得，战争的第一天，几乎所有的乌克兰人都在哭。而我们哭，都是因为看到当地人的遭遇。\n\n就这样，我终于回了国，学业被打断、一切计划也被打乱。当时，我连吃饭的家伙 -- -- 大提琴都没带走，它被放在学校的防空洞里。这也是我想重回学校的一个原因。\n\n这次重回学校，大提琴是找到了，可我的那口\"贵锅\" -- -- 那是我在战前，稀里糊涂花1000多人民币买的，却没了。我经常拿这件事调侃，我在乌克兰念了快五年书（预科一年、本科四年），混得连口锅都没有。\n\n我现在也不想重新买锅，就跟隔壁宿舍的共用一口锅。锅铲我也是借的，谱架也是，能凑合就凑合着用。战前，我买一个东西时会考虑\"这个东西会用比较久，我要买好一点的\"。但现在，我是越简单越好，（再好的东西）说不准哪天就没了，什么都没了。\n\n所有的东西都可以转瞬即逝，生命也是。\n\n大规模停电的基辅\n\n回基辅快一年，停电是这两个月才开始的。\n\n5月份，我住在基辅的学生宿舍，当时还是按区域轮流停电。比如，同一个时间段，有可能这条街有电，那条街就没电。我们装了一款手机软件，里面可以查停电的时间段。\n\n当时，每天都可能停电，有时候停一次，有时停两次，一天通常停3、4个小时。但到6月初，我住进本科导师在基辅州乡下的房子时，一天就只来一次或两次电，一次一两个小时。停电越来越严重，那款手机软件也越来越不准时，有时候上面说什么时候来电，结果又没来。\n\n跟基辅市区比，乡下的电力情况还要好一点，之前基本都不停电，除了这次。\n\n我在国内也经历过停电，停了电还能用4G网。但在这边不可能，基辅一停电，可能是把移动网络的基站都给关了。在基辅市区，一停电，网络就会很卡。而到乡下，只要一停电，我连手机的短信都收不到，一点信号都没有。\n\n在乡下，一停电，导师家的抽水机也罢工，水也停了。对现代社会来说，停水停电简直是要命。我也是生平第一次经历这样的事，哪怕2022年打仗时，都没停过电。\n\n住在基辅高层公寓的人更惨，比如我导师在基辅的公寓是14楼，一停电，电梯也不动了。我导师八十多岁了，左腿还出过车祸，基本走不动了。我导师住的公寓只能用电磁炉炒菜，一停电，菜也炒不了，楼也下不了，很难办。\n\n也因此，我导师一有空就会往他在乡下的房子跑，一是乡下可以用瓦斯炒菜。二是他可以住一楼。乌克兰这边正常是60岁退休，但我导师非常热爱他的工作，就一直干。他属于是乌克兰的功勋艺术家，在国家最厉害的乐团干了二三十年首席。\n\n在基辅，一些新修的公寓或写字楼，会在电梯里放一个急救包 -- -- 里面有水、巧克力啥的，还有尿布，以防电梯的人在停电后出不来。不过，这样的急救包一般很难用到。\n\n更难熬的是没有电的冬天，基辅的冬天最冷可以到零下十几度，一停电，暖气也用不了。记得有一年冬天，我当时在国内，听我基辅当地的朋友说停电很严重。\n\n朋友还告诉我，政府在很多社区建了\"无敌点\"，就是临时的庇护所，里面有电、有暖气，有热水，还有些食物啥的。大家就这么硬撑着过了几个月，后面情况就好转了。\n\n停电的夜晚，我一般会先用户外灯撑一撑，等到户外灯没电时，我就会点起蜡烛。在宿舍的很多个夜晚，我都会边点蜡烛边练琴，这很常见。而到了乡下，蜡烛也变得越来越稀缺。天一黑，我就摸黑拉琴。\n\n很多人家里会自备发电机，这在乡下更常见。在基辅市区，一些商场、超市或药店等，也会备发电机。一停电，就可以用发电机顶上。\n\n但我导师家没有发电机，一停电，网也没，水也没，感觉自己真是\"一觉回到了解放前\"（捂脸哭）。我只能安慰自己，这里适合闭关练琴，正好现在快期末考了。\n\n涨薪的速度追不上物价\n\n这次电力短缺之后，现在在外面租公寓，都要付双倍电费。\n\n我战前租过的公寓，当时夏天吹空调的话，一个月一个人的水电花费等 -- -- 这边叫公用事务费用，会将水、电等费用统计到一个账单，就要500块人民币左右，很贵。更别提现在，我连公寓的电费都付不起。\n\n支付双倍电费，也是因为基辅最大的发电站被炸了，而基辅又是这边人口最多、用电量最大的城市，发电站一时半会儿修不好，就只能从其他国家\"借电\"过来，就很贵。\n\n基辅的公寓一般分成两种，一种就像国内的赫鲁晓夫楼，这种是没有保安的，只有一个单元门。我记得战前，找一个这样的老公寓，交通便利点的，也要一千五六每月。另一种新的公寓楼，有门卫，类似国内的小区，但价格很贵很贵，战前就要三四千一个月。\n\n跟国内一样，这边租公寓也要付中介费跟押金，这样一来就更贵了。打仗之后，现在最划不来的就是租房子。因为你不知道后面会发生什么事儿，哪怕之后你人撤走了，但还有一些东西留在房子里，房东一样会让你付房租。\n\n在基辅市区，其他物价也都在涨，几乎每个超市里的所有东西，每个月都在换价格。我记得之前去学校附近最高档的超市，随便买点东西，差不多也就是一百多两百一个人。现在就连我们宿舍旁边那个超市，我进去随便买个鸡蛋，再买点啥，都得人民币一百多。\n\n我经常去吃的那家煎饼店，它每次出新价格就拿胶布粘上去，老的（价签）也不撕。短短一两个月，它那个胶布厚得不知道有多离谱。按当地币格里夫纳算，涨了估计得有二十。\n\n这边在外面吃非常贵，最便宜的就是这个煎饼，一个煎饼现在也要人民币十五六块了。我老说，如果这边有国内那种十多块钱的盒饭，我肯定是第一个去办年卡的。\n\n物价飞涨，最近看新闻，当地的平均薪资涨了一些。基辅的工资真的不高，拿我导师来说，他在国家最厉害的乐团干首席，已经干到头了，一个月的退休金加工资也就1000美金（约7250人民币）。\n\n但在基辅，现在一个月哪怕都自己做饭，生活费也至少要两三千人民币。很多人还要租房，战前最便宜的公寓也要一千五百多人民币，现在租金也涨了很多。所以，普通人不涨工资真是活不下去。\n\n再说了，薪资再涨，也赶不上当地币贬值的速度。我记得19年刚来基辅时，美金兑当地币格里夫纳的汇率（以下简称汇率）是，1美元换当地币24或25，最高时28。打仗的前两天，汇率又到了1:30或31。打仗之后，汇率一路飙到了1:40。\n\n如果当地币再这么跌下去，那跟废纸还有什么区别？最后政府要求强制封盘，汇率跌到40之后，就不能再往下了。可这次大规模停电之后，估计汇率怕是跌破了40。\n\n我在基辅一般都用美元，我轻易不会换当地币，除非我知道自己要用多少，当天就把它花掉，不会存在手里等着它贬值。\n\n看汇率，也成了我的生活日常，每次上街我都会去看。现在，正常的汇率是1:36到38区间。如果汇率跌破了38，那可能就意味着最近会有轰炸，或是其他不好的事情。汇率的变化，一般会比实际发生轰炸等事件，要早个一两天。\n\n一旦汇率异常，我会第一时间把自己的大提琴拿去防空洞，这样防空警报一响，我就能跑得更快。\n\n回乡下的基辅人\n\n跟基辅市区比，我现在住的乡下，虽然停电停水，却也算是不愁吃喝。\n\n我住在导师家的阁楼，一下楼就是他家的院子，他们平常休息就在前院，是一大片草坪，旁边还长了些迷迭香之类的香料。\n\n后院需要我拐个弯才能到，很大一块地方，种满了各种果树，有苹果树、梨树、李子树，还种了草莓、小瓜，塑料大棚里还种了番茄和黄瓜。当然，这些农作物基本都是我导师托邻居帮忙打理的。\n\n如果有自家菜园还没有长好的，我导师又很想吃的，就可以去镇上买。镇上每天都可以买到新鲜的蔬果，比如刚从地里拿出来的黄瓜、土豆。\n\n我导师家的房子很大，家里的设施也很齐全，壁炉、烧烤的地方都有。不过，一出家门，我现在住的这个村子，村里的路基本是那种石头路，有些路段还有那种老土路。村里路灯也有，但也要看路段。\n\n由于这边都是私人土地，即便只是在村子里建一个路灯，也需要这段路的所有居民都同意，大家都出这个钱，才能建得起来。也因此，这边乡下的基础设施参差不齐，有些村子的村民有钱，就把路弄得好一点。有些村子大家都不愿意盖，就是那种老土路。总的来说，这边乡下整体的基础设施比不上国内那种政府帮建的\"最美乡村\"。\n\n到了周末，排队出基辅市区的人，非常多。像我导师一样乡下跟市区都有房的人，到了周末，都恨不得往乡下跑吧。\n\n住在乡下的另一个好处是，听不到防空警报。相比基辅市区，村子里相对更安全。因为这里没什么军事设施、也没什么能源设施，他炸了也没用。而且一颗导弹就价值几千万美金，也不太会拿它来炸村子。\n\n除非地面部队进来占领土地，才会波及到村子，否则他们是不会轻易来轰炸村子的。村子里也没有防空洞，但这边会有地窖，有点像国内北方的村子，他们会把秋天吃不完的东西存在地窖里。地窖，就类似村子里的防空洞。\n\n住在村子里的这段时间，我因此也睡得更香甜，无所谓什么防不防空警报。\n\n我算是同学中唯一一个住进导师乡下家里的学生，他就在家里给我上\"小课\"。这是导师主动提出来的，因为他有一次跟着乐团去日本巡演，好几个月没能给我上课，他就想着给我补课。有过第一次后，这好像就变成了一个\"传统\"，我每个学期都要来。\n\n不过，说是说\"小课\"，但我导师一分钱都不收我的。我还想着不收钱，那就买点菜、买点米，他也不收，还让我在那吃、在那住。\n\n我们处得很好，跟俩爷孙一样。我经常开玩笑跟他说，他这个级别的艺术家，放在国内，上一节\"小课\"都得好几千一小时。他就回我，\"那好，我要去中国当百万富翁\"。\n\n事实上，自从打仗后，我导师一步都没离开过基辅。最严重的时候，军队都已经打到基辅外围了，我当时在回国路上，一直打电话劝他出国躲一躲。他不在征兵的年龄段，是可以出国的。他还有很多欧洲的亲戚和朋友，也都劝他。\n\n住回基辅市区后，一有休息，我基本就会去听音乐会。打仗之后，这边有非常多的音乐会，街边、音乐厅、博物馆，到处都是。我感觉现在的音乐会比战前还多。\n\n基辅战后的音乐会，大多与战争有关\n\n对音乐专业的学生来说，这是好事，我们能得到的表演机会变多了。以前挤破脑袋才能争取到的表演机会，现在变得非常多。\n\n我见过的大部分音乐会都是募捐性质的，比如给前线士兵买物资。也有一些实践性质的音乐会，就是演奏一些新的音乐作品，这些作品多是战争期间创作的，以学生创作的为主。\n\n我印象最深的一场音乐会，就属于实践一类的音乐会。它开在基辅的一个小剧场 -- -- 它也是咖啡厅，平时会做一些小型的放映。当晚，音乐人在台上演奏，背景播放的是她在前线城市走访拍的纪录片。纪录片拍到了这些城市的街景、废墟，更多的是讲述老百姓的故事。\n\n我记得，片子中间讲了个小女孩的故事，她在战争中失去了自己的爸爸妈妈，几乎一夜之间家里面的人都没了，家也变成了废墟......\n\n拍纪录片的是位乌克兰女生，她应该是属于志愿兵。我身边的当地朋友，也有女生去参军的，大部分我玩得好的男生朋友，都在部队。\n\n现在，基辅市区的音乐会多了很多，但我们学校却变得越来越冷清。\n\n下：汶奇（最右）与其他音乐人得到的演出机会在变多\n\n每次经过学校的大教室，我都会回忆起战前，几乎每天晚上，这里都会有各种专业的学生一起玩，一起搞音乐会。管你是学古典乐的，还是玩爵士的，都可以一起玩。弹贝斯的跟拉大提琴的一起，吹萨克斯的也跟小提琴的凑一块儿。\n\n可现在，学校里也多了很多我不认识的新生。那些我认识的朋友，有的上战场，有的出国，恐怕再也回不到当时了。\n\n再过一年，我也将完成学业离开乌克兰，我永远不会忘记我的朋友们，和这段留学经历。\n\n注：以上照片均由受访者汶奇提供。",

Despite the semblance of normalcy in Kyiv, with bustling streets and social activities, the city is still under the constant threat of air raids, leading to frequent air raid sirens and occasional explosions.\n\nWenqi describes the challenges of living in Kyiv, including significant power outages caused by Russian airstrikes on the city's largest power plant. These outages have disrupted daily life, making it difficult to maintain a consistent schedule and forcing residents to adapt to unpredictable electricity availability.\n\nWenqi's return to Kyiv was driven by his desire to resume his interrupted studies, despite the ongoing conflict. He details his arduous journey back to Ukraine, involving multiple flights and a bus ride from Moldova, due to the lack of air travel into Ukraine.\n\nThe article also highlights the economic hardships faced by Kyiv residents, with rising living costs and inflation outpacing wage increases. Wenqi notes the significant increase in prices for basic goods and services, making daily life increasingly expensive.\n\nDespite the war, cultural activities like music concerts have proliferated in Kyiv, often serving as fundraisers for the war effort. Wenqi finds solace in these events, which provide performance opportunities for music students and foster a sense of community.\n\nOverall, the article paints a picture of resilience and adaptation in the face of ongoing conflict, as residents of Kyiv navigate the challenges of war while striving to maintain a semblance of normal life."

        "title": "聚焦台海 - 台海冲突可避免？  法国学者：中国会用经济压制台湾",
        "body": "中华民国总统赖清德在中国眼中是个台独份子，尽管自他上任以来试图对中国释出善意，但是北京政府始终充耳不闻。研究当代中国的法国学者蓝可（Emmanuel Lincot）指出，中国官方语言一向轻忽赖清德，但又自相矛盾的，在赖清德上任初期，便举行具重大威胁性的大规模军演，对他施展不成比例的武力。在台海情势压力未降低之时，蓝可指出，中国目前不会武力攻打台湾。他甚至认为，中国最终不会选择武力，而是运用经济手段压制台湾。\n\n蓝可说：「我认为中国目前不会真正动用武力攻打台湾。我们可从不同面向观察，例如现在透过Google，就能轻易得知福建、广东是否有军舰聚集，我们并未见到解放军有登陆的准备。我也认为，中国最终不打算使用武力，而会运用经济手段压制台湾。依我看，这是比较明智的作法，成本也较低。如果中国攻打台湾，那会演变成世界大战，对中国丝毫没有好处，道理就是这么简单。」\n\n蓝可观察赖清德上任一个多月来，延续蔡英文政策。仅管理性看来，中国和台湾之间眼前不会爆发冲突。但他表示，永远不要低估中国领导人的非理性。中国和俄国一样，面对明确的目标，都提出论述合理化他们的行动，例如北京宣称台湾自古就属于中国的一部分。他们展现出理性的一面，但其中有矛盾，西方人很难理解。以俄乌战争为例，法国总统马克龙直到俄国军队进入乌克兰领土的当天，都还以为他可以和普丁如常的沟通。蓝可说，依西方民主体制的标准来看，普丁不是正常人，习近平也不是。在西方人眼中，武力战争是自杀式的作法。台海冲突不只对世界会是灾难，对中国也是。\n\n「战争要付出代价，我不确定中国是否可长期支撑武力冲突。中国势必面对禁运制裁，显露自身的脆弱性。大家很快想到科技层面，但不只这个面向，我认为，最重要的是粮食安全问题。中国高度依赖粮食进口，如遭到制裁，那会是灾难。」蓝可说。\n\n虽然中国不断秀武力，展露威吓，但事实上，中国无法自外于世界。战争对中国人民会产生灾难性后果，连带影响中共政权。蓝可表示，尽管外界看中国一直存在有好战的民意声浪，但必须正视一点：中国经济正陷入困境。官方数字显示，城市失业率高达20％，而自去年6月以后便不再公布失业数据，令人想像失业率继续攀升。过去几年来，疫情重创民众的生活，有数十万维持平日生活运转的商家倒闭，在缺乏失业补助、和社福系统支持下，导致许多人的生活不稳定，在社会间营造焦虑气氛。\n\n蓝可又说，习近平在俄乌战争中支持普丁，并未在中国内部获得全面支持。中国因支持俄国，与美国对立，如果另再加上台湾因素，那真的是雪上加霜，中国民意没有准备好要面对这样的情况。\n\n尽管种种迹象指出，挑起武力冲突对中国不利。但是蓝可另外提到一个令人忧心的因素，中国目前的处境类似二次世界大战前、1930年代的日本，在世界上越来越遭到孤立，他们自认受威胁，或者想像受到来自西方世界的威胁，于是选择开战。蓝可说，美国今年大选结果不明，法国及欧盟没有意愿、也没有资源关注台海局势，无论情势如何演变，台湾只能倚赖自身实力捍卫生存权。",

Lincot argues that while China has shown military aggression towards Taiwan, it is unlikely to engage in a full-scale military invasion. Instead, China is expected to use economic measures to pressure Taiwan, which Lincot believes is a more cost-effective and rational approach.\n\nKey points include:\n- Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te is seen by China as a pro-independence figure, despite his attempts to show goodwill.\n- China has conducted large-scale military exercises as a show of force but is not preparing for an invasion.\n- Lincot suggests that economic pressure is a more likely strategy for China, given the high costs and global repercussions of a military conflict.\n- He highlights the economic challenges within China, such as high urban unemployment and dependency on food imports, which would be exacerbated by war and sanctions.\n- Lincot also notes the internal and external political dynamics, including China's support for Russia in the Ukraine conflict and the potential isolation similar to pre-World War II Japan.\n- The article concludes that Taiwan must rely on its own strength for survival, as international support may be limited.\n\nOverall, the article emphasizes the complexities and potential consequences of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, suggesting that economic strategies are more probable than military action."

        "summary": "Germany's arms exports are set to reach a new record this year, with the first half of 2024 already achieving 60% of last year's total. The German Ministry of Economic Affairs reported a 30% year-on-year increase in arms exports, totaling at least €7.48 billion from January 1 to June 18, 2024. Nearly two-thirds of these exports, amounting to €4.88 billion, were sent to Ukraine, marking a historic high. Despite the ruling coalition's initial promise to limit arms deliveries, especially to non-EU and non-NATO countries, the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to a surge in exports. Germany is now Ukraine's second-largest arms supplier after the U.S. Other significant recipients include Singapore, India, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. The data was released at the request of Sevim Dagdelen from the newly formed BSW party, who criticized the government for increasing arms exports to conflict zones, warning it could lead to a European war."

        "body": "今天是俄乌战争第859天，根据乌总参公布的最新数据，在过去24小时里全线发生了117次战斗，俄罗斯军队共损失1110人，坦克19辆，装甲车26辆，火炮66门......\n\n目前,俄乌战线的整体局势已在潜移默化中发生改变，这一变化既符合美西方援助到来后的路线图，也是军事辩证法通过不断消耗敌人战争资源战改变双方力量对比的规律论。\n\n战况方面\n\n在哈尔科夫以北的沃夫昌斯克，继29日夜乌军对俄军发动月夜攻势后昨日又向俄罗斯人又发起了一次大的进攻，迫使俄军主力不断的向两国边界撤退。\n\n目前在哈尔科夫以北，沃夫昌斯克战场的俄军已开始败退，利普奇战场还在激战，但乌军已完全占据了优势，俄军面临的困难越来越多......首先是补给问题，由于乌克兰军队不断地打击俄本土边境地区的俄军兵力集结、军事装备以及补给线，导致了俄军的后勤被严重削弱。\n\n其次是士气问题，人海冲锋与人肉进攻造成的巨大伤亡让俄军的溃逃与投降已成为了普遍性现象，在乌军昨日的进攻中，出现了大量有关车臣督战队与被督战俄军一起拒绝作战的报到。\n\n军事博主伊里奇洛夫称：\"乌克兰军队已加快了对沃夫昌斯克进攻，试图通过包围来获得胜利，这样的战术结果难度就大。乌军将俄军第2次赶出哈尔科夫或许能够做到，打歼灭战却不容易，因为该地区位于边境，俄军随时随地可以撤回国内......\"我们认为这种认知是客观的。\n\n战线南下\n\n在东线克雷明纳，我们昨日报道了乌军第12特战旅、第95空突旅及13猎兵旅联手将色雷不良斯基森林地区俄军赶出了阵地......昨日下午，乌军第46旅又在克雷明纳西边的特尔尼与南面的扬波力夫卡发起了反击，从俄罗斯人手里夺回6.4平方公里领土。\n\n以下绿色地区为俄军色雷不良斯基森林阵地，箭头为收复地区\n\n在巴赫穆特的卡索夫亚尔，乌克兰军队昨日击败了俄军425突击营后继续反推，在运河以西和南部种植园方向均取得了进展，从而让恰索夫亚尔防线固若金汤。\n\n该战场此前一直是乌军压力最大的地方，俄国防部给该地区俄军下达的命令是5月9日前攻克恰索夫亚尔......攻坚的俄近卫第76空降师、风暴Z部队等战斗单元在滑翔炸弹加持下一直疯狂进攻......经过长时间消耗后俄罗斯人的进攻动能如今越来越弱。\n\n战场之外\n\n尽管俄罗斯6月13日和6月25日连续两次抛出和谈意向，但均被乌克兰拒绝，因为普京的和谈基础是乌军撤出乌东四州以及不得加入北约。毫无诚意的和谈条件乌克兰显然不会接受，不仅乌克兰无法接受，就连俄罗斯本国国民也觉得是天方夜谭。俄罗斯网友谢尔盖.亚克称：\"这不是和谈，是继续战争的宣言\"；科兹洛夫吐槽称\"眼看特别军事行动前景越来越渺茫，这样的条件有什么建设性价值呢？\"\n\n俄罗斯电报群今日消息：克里米亚大桥疑遭到导弹袭击，巨大爆炸声震惊居民，多辆救护车紧急赶往现场......有消息称这是乌克兰F-16的首次战果，该消息虽未得到证实，但克里米亚大桥关键部位受损的消息已在莫斯科传遍，电报群中的悲痛或许就是最好证明。\n\n基辅邮报30日消息，匈牙利总理欧尔班表示下周将访问乌克兰，改善两国关系。一直以来匈牙利身在欧盟和北约，却始终与俄罗斯眉来眼去，不仅拒绝援助乌克兰，还在援乌问题上屡屡行使否决权，让欧盟其他国家大为恼火，受到成员国共同抵制以及欧盟的惩罚后这个骑墙派近来已有所收敛，开始支持乌克兰加入欧盟谈判。\n\n盖洛普民意调查最新结果显示，普京在俄罗斯年轻人中的支持率已从曾经的85%跌到如今的15%。全俄舆论中心发布了普京的信用评级仅剩下31%的报告。与此同时，4个邻国的俄族人对普京的支持率也出现了大幅度下跌，亚美尼亚俄族人对普京的支持率从45%跌为26%，哈萨克斯俄族人对普京支持率从55%下跌到29%，亚美尼亚从45%下跌到了32%，吉尔吉斯坦也跌了15个百分点......百度AI对于普京支持率下跌到15%给出的答案是：\n\n俄罗斯媒体消息，俄罗斯大邻居的一架运20a军用运输机昨日降落在了莫斯科，去干什么谁也不知道，但总让人忐忑不安，多事之秋......\n\n与此同时，俄罗斯和印度联合军工企向菲律宾交付的第1套布拉莫斯反舰导弹。制造商亚历山大.马克西切夫在回复向马尼拉交付导弹问题上称：我们完成了3个作战单位供应，并对菲方人员进行了培训，这只是交易的初始阶段，我们还将继续向菲方交付更多的导弹......俄罗斯高等经济学院高级研究员瓦西里卡申采访时表示：\"布拉莫斯是在印度生产的，属于俄罗斯玛瑙反舰导弹的许可版，这是一种高超音速导弹，射程300公里，将确保菲律宾能够击沉敌人的水面舰艇，在一定程度上加强菲律宾海上防御力量，威慑个别国家......\"\n\n从俄朝签订盟友关系条约到帮助越南发展核技术，再到向菲律宾交付高超音速反舰导弹，克里姆林宫做这一切究竟是为对付谁不言而喻......庆父不死，鲁难不已，一个风雨飘摇的没落政府直到如今还要兴风作浪，看来，除恶务尽完全有必要！祝福乌克兰，也坚信乌克兰将士一定会越战越勇，蜇龙腾空，飞剑斩长鲸！",

        "body": "今日内容\n\n乌成功局部反击 苦战无果 3万俄军被困\n\nF-16或已首战乌克兰 何时能完全掌握制空权？\n\n更多俄高级官员被通缉 以色列要援8套爱国者\n\n聚焦战场动态，剖析地缘争端，欢迎收看新冷战情室，我是远山。\n\n今天是2024年7月1日，俄乌战争进入第859天。6月30日，乌克兰对克里米亚的占科伊、塞瓦斯托波尔和辛菲罗波尔发起导弹和无人机袭击。同时，俄罗斯六个州遭到数十架无人机的袭击，这种情况在俄罗斯已经成为常态。据俄媒报导，俄罗斯防空系统击落了36架乌克兰无人机。\n\n与此同时，乌克兰持续打击俄军的防空系统、雷达、炼油厂、油库和补给线，从源头上摧毁俄罗斯的能源经济，削弱其战争投入。\n\n乌成功局部反击 3万俄军被困\n\n在战场上，乌克兰继续清除俄军的有生力量和装备，现在俄军已经将二战时期的摩托车维修后投入战场，装备损失严重程度，可想而知。乌克兰的持续消耗战正在让俄罗斯陷入进退两难的境地，这种压力或许很快就会达到临界点。\n\n哈尔科夫地区，乌军向利博克（Hlyboke）和斯塔里齐亚（Starytsia）、沃夫昌斯克发动反击。战争研究所报告称，哈尔科夫北部的局势已经稳定。\n\n俄军多个旅崩溃后，继续向哈尔科夫增派援军，试图巩固微小的战果，但现实很残酷，俄军难以维系这里的战斗。\n\n据《福布斯》报导，俄军曾试图占领沃夫昌斯克，但经过一番苦战后，大约有3万名俄军被困在这里，报导称，俄军估计已经失去了一个整旅的力量。\n\n另外，乌军还在沃夫昌斯克击败了俄军的精锐第83空降旅，值得注意的是，这里的许多俄军士兵拒绝继续战斗。此外还有一个战果，那就是自俄乌全面开战以来，如果加上最新击落的一架Su-25,乌克兰击落的俄罗斯各类战机和直升机数量加起来达到了惊人的686架之多。\n\n最新的地理位置录像显示，乌克兰军队正在沿着赫罗伊夫·霍尔诺比利亚大街前进。俄罗斯媒体声称，俄军第83旅的残余部队正在逃离。现在就看乌军第82旅能不能把他们拦截了。\n\n扎波罗热地区，29日，距离前线50公里处，一枚伊斯坎德尔-M导弹击中了当地的一列乌军纵队。乌军这次损失不小。俄罗斯消息来源声称，他们摧毁了乌军的M113、BUK-M1、BMP-1和卡车。目前尚不清楚俄军使用什么系统进行的攻击。\n\n阿夫迪夫卡前线，俄罗斯几乎控制了整个索基尔（Sokil），并且继续沿新奥列克桑德里夫卡-索基尔-乌曼斯克推进，试图拉平战线，但速度不如今年早些时候。\n\n6月30日，乌克兰发布数据，俄军人员、装备损失继续走高，但相比之前的强度有所下降。\n\n外界还关注到，最近半年，由于缺乏防空导弹，乌克兰人被迫采用各种方式保卫天空，启用并改进40年前的螺旋桨老飞机Yak-52就是一个很好的例子，这款飞机最近还有所斩获。\n\n6月29日，网传一架Yak-52飞机在空中和一架俄罗斯侦察无人机对峙，最后近距离用霰弹枪将无人机击落。虽然螺旋桨飞机的速度不如喷气式飞机，但比无人机快，所以Yak-52能追上这架俄罗斯Zala无人机。\n\nF-16或已首战乌克兰 何时能完全掌握制空权？\n\n6月29日，乌克兰前空军飞行员兼防空顾问泽维尔·泰特曼在社交媒体上宣布，与国际军团确认消息，首批F-16战机已经抵达乌克兰并进行了首次攻击。\n\n丹麦皇家空军司令扬达姆少将近日也表示，向乌克兰交付F-16战斗机的计划预计将如期完成。不过他强调：出于行动安全的考虑，不能透露具体的日期。但希望能按计划交付。当战斗机在乌克兰准备就绪时，会通知大家。\n\n此前，丹麦、比利时、挪威和荷兰都表示，将在6月或夏季向乌克兰交付F-16。鉴于最近克里米亚的俄罗斯防空系统，包括S-500系统，接连被摧毁，以及俄罗斯本土别尔哥罗德州频繁遭到乌军使用美制精确制导炸弹的轰炸，外界认为，或许有理由相信F-16已经投入战斗。\n\n当然，乌克兰接收的首批F-16战机数量不会太多，预计为4至6架，这与乌克兰的后勤维护能力有关系。\n\n由于这场战争实际上是整个西方与俄罗斯的对抗，虽然俄罗斯的武器性能并不像其公布的数据那样强大，但因为核武器的存在，西方在援助乌克兰时一直设有自我约束的红线。因此，西方援助的F-16数量确实有限，只能逐步改善乌克兰的防空能力。\n\n许多人设想，F-16一到战场形势就会立刻改变，这样的情况可能并不会出现，因为乌克兰接收的首批F-16数量不足以形成压倒性的军事优势。\n\n扬达姆少将还表示，即使乌克兰得到了F-16战斗机，仍无法完全控制自己的领空。他指出：\"乌克兰要获得制空权，还有许多工作要做。他们需要更有效的空军和地面防空力量。\"\n\n也就是说，虽然F-16能够帮助乌克兰赢得部分制空权，并拦截俄罗斯的导弹和无人机，但乌克兰仍需进一步清除俄军的防空系统，并利用爱国者等防空系统保护F-16的驻扎基地。目前，乌克兰正通过海马斯发射ATACMS导弹来进行这类工作。\n\n估计收到F-16后，乌克兰会先尽量清理前线和克里米亚的防空系统，通过远距离发射精确滑翔制导炸弹，并使用空空导弹拦截俄军导弹。\n\n此外，目前，飞行员数量有限且培训进度较慢，也是乌克兰要面对的挑战。还有地勤人员的短缺同样是个问题，却鲜为人知。实际上，培训成熟且有经验的地勤人员所需的时间远比飞行员要长。当然也不排除西方可能会提供相应的支持服务来弥补这一短板。\n\n有分析认为，首批驾驶乌克兰F-16战机的飞行员可能不是西方培训的乌克兰飞行员，很可能是国际军团中的F-16飞行员。此前就有不少前美国F-16飞行员表示，愿意为乌克兰驾驶F-16参战。\n\n关于F-16的防御能力，扬达姆少将表示：\"如果F-16被击落，对俄罗斯来说将是巨大的战略胜利。我们正在尽最大努力确保乌克兰飞行员熟练操作F-16，以将风险降到最低。但我不能保证任何事情。当然，如果其中一些被击落，我会感到非常遗憾。\"\n\n确实，任何武器一旦上战场，包括F-35在内，都有被击落的风险，更何况是F-16。当前乌克兰只能通过前期工作，降低F-16被击落的风险。\n\n更为关键的是，F-16只是一个作战平台，其威力取决于拜登政府为乌克兰的F-16提供的武器配置。此外，F-16要真正发挥巨大威力，还需要瑞典提供的预警机到位。\n\nF-16战机虽然不是万能的，但对局势发展起着至关重要的作用。F-16战机配合爱国者防空系统，将有效改变俄军投掷FAB炸弹的局面。如果确认F-16战机参加首次战斗，将进一步加深人们对目前局势有利于乌克兰的印象。\n\n更多俄高级官员被通缉 以色列要援8套爱国者\n\n最新的消息显示，英国《金融时报》援引消息称，美国、以色列和乌克兰正在讨论，以色列计划向乌克兰提供多达8套爱国者防空系统，以帮助其抵御俄罗斯的进攻。这一援助需要拜登政府的支持或者向以色列提供相当的军事援助来进行交换。\n\n这些在海湾战争期间部署的M901 PAC-2系统比乌克兰目前使用的爱国者PAC-3老旧，不过，PAC-2的优势在于射程更远，就像乌克兰的S-200之于S-300一样，对发射滑翔制导炸弹的俄军苏-34威胁更大。最重要的是，这些爱国者可以发射目前美国提供给乌克兰的那些拦截导弹。\n\n俄罗斯的麻烦还不止于此，海牙国际刑事法院上周已经发出了逮捕令，针对俄罗斯前国防部长谢尔盖·绍伊古和俄罗斯陆军总司令瓦列里·格拉西莫夫，指控他们在入侵乌克兰期间犯下战争罪和反人类罪。这两位高级官员被指控参与了包括轰炸乌克兰民用能源基础设施在内的多项罪行。此举标志着国际刑事法院对俄罗斯高级官员的进一步法律追责，包括与俄罗斯总统普京一起领导入侵行动的其他关键人物。尽管俄罗斯不是国际刑事法院的成员国，但这些指控可能会在国际社会引起强烈反响，包括对被指控人员的国际旅行限制和其他制裁措施。\n\n好的，今天的新冷战情室就到这儿了，关注我们，聚焦战场动态，剖析地缘争端，精彩尽在新冷战情室！\n\n=====================\n\n大家好，我是《新冷战情室》主持人。\n\n喜欢我们的频道，欢迎点赞，订阅，评论，并开启小铃铛🔔就可在第一时间观看精彩内容哦〜\n\n●干净世界《新冷战情室》订阅频道\n\nhttps://www.ganjing.com/zh-TW/channel/1f0pfr9iea8dLmIA3dw0Nuyyd12m0c\n\n●《新冷战情室》订阅频道\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCfjd8aOsJHdpgj6FD9L1w (文章仅代表作者个人立场和观点)\n\n焦点\"乌克兰危机\n\n来源:新冷战情室 --版权所有，任何形式转载需看中国授权许可。严禁建立镜像网站.\n\n本文短网址：\n\n相似文章： 換一批\n\n換一批\n\n读者推荐： 換一批\n\n換一批\n\n读者喜欢： 換一批\n\n換一批\n\n1\n\n新一期特刊已经发表\n\n请荣誉会员登陆下载\n\n会员\n\n1\n\n新一期特刊已经发表\n\n请荣誉会员登陆下载\n\n【诚征荣誉会员】溪流能够汇成大海，小善可以成就大爱。我们向全球华人诚意征集万名荣誉会员：每位荣誉会员每年只需支付一份订阅费用，成为《看中国》网站的荣誉会员，就可以助力我们突破审查与封锁，向至少10000位中国大陆同胞奉上独立真实的关键资讯，在危难时刻向他们发出预警，救他们于大瘟疫与其它社会危难之中。\n\n欢迎给您喜欢的作者捐助。您的爱心鼓励就是对我们媒体的耕耘。\n\n来源:新冷战情室\n\n关键字搜索： 俄乌战争 普京 俄军 乌军 俄罗斯 乌克兰",

        "title": "赛轮集团跻身2024全球轮胎20强",
        "body": "导读：《Tyrepress》根据各企业2023年销售额发布最新全球轮胎20强榜单。\n\n近日，英国媒体《Tyrepress》根据各企业2023年的销售额，发布了最新的全球轮胎20强榜单。2023年，国外轮胎市场受供应链挑战、通货膨胀、地缘局势紧张等多重因素影响，轮胎行业发展受阻。然而，国内轮胎市场却呈现出截然不同的景象，受市场需求恢复性提升、中国新能源汽车快速增长以及出口市场火爆等多重利好因素的推动，轮胎厂商过去一年的经营状况普遍利好。接下来，我们将一起探讨过去一年中，全球轮胎20强的排名发生了哪些变化。\n\n在最新榜单中，全球轮胎第一梯队的米其林、普利司通、固特异、大陆集团依然稳居前列，排名没有发生变化。第二梯队中，倍耐力成功取代住友橡胶，成为全球第五；韩泰、优科豪马的排名同样保持稳定。而在第三梯队中，中策橡胶依然位居全球第9；尤为引人注目的是，赛轮集团排名连升2位，成功取代东洋轮胎，首次跻身全球前十。\n\n赛轮集团的飞速发展得益于其前瞻性的战略布局和全球化经营策略。据数据显示，赛轮集团2023年全年营业收入约259.78亿元，同比增加18.61%，是榜单中增速最快的企业之一。今年一季度，赛轮集团继续保持高速增长态势，实现营业收入72.96亿元，同比增长35.84%。\n\n赛轮集团的全球化布局是其快速发展的重要支撑。近年来，赛轮轮胎加速\"出海\"，不断拓展国际市场。其在越南、柬埔寨、墨西哥等地的投资项目相继落地，进一步提升了公司的全球产能和市场占有率。特别是今年，赛轮集团的投资动作频繁，拟在印尼建设年产300万条半钢子午线轮胎、60万条全钢子午线轮胎及3.7万吨非公路轮胎项目，并与墨西哥Tire Direct合资建设年产600万条半钢子午线轮胎项目，标志着公司在北美市场的布局迈出了坚实的一步。\n\n赛轮集团的成功不仅在于其全球化布局，更在于其持续的技术创新和市场拓展。公司注重产品研发和品质提升，不断推出符合市场需求的高性能轮胎产品。同时，赛轮集团积极开拓国内外市场，与多家知名车企建立合作关系，进一步提升了品牌影响力和市场竞争力。在新能源汽车领域，赛轮集团也展现出了强大的实力，成功推出了多款新能源汽车专用轮胎产品，赢得了市场的广泛认可。\n\n米其林和普利司通：全球轮胎霸主\n\n在全球轮胎市场中，米其林和普利司通无疑是霸主地位，只有这两家企业的销售额超过200亿欧元。固特异和马牌紧跟其后，销售额也远超100亿欧元。\n\n在前十名中，销售额差距最小的是倍耐力、住友和韩泰。这三家企业2023年的销售额分别增长了0.5%、7.1%和6.5%。尽管住友橡胶的销售额增速高于倍耐力，但由于日元贬值等因素的影响，其排名却被倍耐力反超。\n\n值得一提的是，优科豪马在去年5月成功收购了特瑞堡，然而合并业绩尚未完全体现。该公司曾预计，收购后每年可为公司带来约10亿欧元的销售额，或将在明年带动其排名上升。\n\n11-20强：排名翻天覆地\n\n相较于十强排名的稳定，11-20强的排名变化可谓翻天覆地。其中，诺记轮胎因俄乌战争等因素经营每况愈下，最终跌出榜单，取而代之的是印度JK轮胎。\n\n东洋和正新轮胎的排名也各下降一位，这两家企业经营虽较为稳定，但面对赛轮等企业的快速发展，其竞争压力也显而易见。\n\n锦湖轮胎则表现亮眼，排名超过佳通，位居全球第14。佳通也是整个榜单中，排名下滑最多的企业，尽管只下滑了2位。2023年锦湖营收突破4万亿韩元，同比增长13.5%；营业利润更是大幅增长了1677%，创下历史新高。今年一季度，锦湖轮胎的销售额也进一步提升。5月，锦湖还发布了新能源汽车专用的EnnoV系列轮胎，旨在进一步扩大公司竞争力。锦湖能否重返全球排名前十的巅峰？让我们拭目以待。\n\n耐克森的全球排名也提升了2位，欧洲市场的强劲表现带动了公司业绩的稳步提升。随着捷克工厂二期扩建工程的完成，并于2024年开始生产，耐克森预计到2025年，捷克的年产能将达到1100万条轮胎，总产能将达到每年5200万条。\n\n美国泰坦国际的排名虽有下滑，但该公司于今年宣布以2.96亿美元的现金和股票，收购美国知名特种轮胎制造商Carlstar Group LLC。这一收购预计将带动泰坦的业绩增长。\n\n综合来看，榜单中第11位和第20位的销售额差距仅有16亿欧元左右，这表明在这一区间内的企业竞争更为激烈，排名也更容易出现变化。\n\n2024年，在地缘政治局势紧张、通货膨胀加剧等多重因素影响下，欧美轮胎行业迎来了减产、裁员、关厂潮。与此同时，全球轮胎市场的供需关系也在飞速变化，中国轮胎企业加速出海，以性价比优势开启\"全球替代\"的新篇章。\n\n固特异今年一季度销售额下降了8.2%，净亏损5700万美元，已连续亏损6个季度。面对困境，公司进行了一系列大刀阔斧的改革措施，包括关闭多家工厂和出售部分资产。\n\n诺记轮胎也面临困境，今年一季度净亏损2620万欧元，相比去年一季度亏损额进一步扩大。红海危机和芬兰的罢工导致生产损失、运输延误和物流费用上涨，严重影响了公司利润。为了应对困境，诺记轮胎不得不采取暂时解雇员工等紧急措施。\n\n普利司通也宣布了解雇其美国得梅因工厂100多名员工的决定，理由是\"农业轮胎行业的需求限制\"。这是该工厂自1990年以来的首次裁员。此外，普利司通还关闭了在中国沈阳的卡客车轮胎工厂，以进一步优化成本结构和业务模式。\n\n米其林今年一季度的销售额也下降了2.7%，轮胎总销量下降了4.1%。为了应对市场变化，米其林计划将中国沈阳工厂和波兰Olsztyn工厂转为乘用车轮胎生产，并关闭中国上海工厂的金属骨架材料业务。这些调整将导致米其林在全球的卡车轮胎产能减少15%。\n\n住友橡胶的土耳其工厂也因劳资纠纷问题而发生了罢工活动。罢工期间，工厂预计减产约16万条轮胎，这对住友橡胶的生产和供应链无疑是一次严峻的考验。\n\n反观国内轮胎市场，却呈现出截然不同的景象。从A股各家轮胎公布的业绩来看，中国轮胎企业的盈利能力和规模实力进一步扩大。各种扩产、技改、新建项目纷纷上马，展现出中国轮胎行业的蓬勃生机。\n\n2024年5月份，中国国内生产的橡胶轮胎外胎数量为9340.0万条，同比增长了9.5%，环比4月上涨了4.4%。1月至5月期间，中国累计生产的橡胶轮胎外胎数量达到43212.9万条，同比增长了11.1%。这些数据充分证明了中国轮胎市场的强劲增长势头。\n\n在出口方面，2024年前5个月中国橡胶轮胎出口量达363万吨，同比增长4.6%；出口金额为642亿元，同比增长6.1%。这些数据表明中国轮胎在国际市场上的竞争力正在不断增强。\n\n然而，我们也需警惕当前国内轮胎市场两极分化越来越严重的问题。虽然半钢胎市场在海内外消费降级及中国汽车销量的带动下越来越春风得意，但全钢胎市场受到全球及国内基建工程的放缓而需求收缩。面对这一挑战，中国轮胎企业需要继续加强技术创新和市场拓展，提升产品品质和品牌影响力，以在全球轮胎市场的竞争中保持领先地位。",

2024年乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩连任欧盟委员会主席之路并非一帆风顺。今年欧洲议会选举中，传统三大党团欧洲人民党、社会党和复兴欧洲党席位减少但仍占多数，维持主流党团地位。与此同时，极右翼党团在法国、德国、意大利取得显著进展，影响力增强。冯德莱恩为顺利连任对右翼的示好，导致社会党不满，引发了内部谈判困难。\n\n2. 其他的欧盟领导人如意大利总理梅洛尼、波兰总理图斯克都希望参与欧盟职位分配，以确保自身阵营在新一届欧盟权力中枢中获得话语权，增加了冯德莱恩的压力。平衡内部矛盾势必成为冯德莱恩未来在任期间绕不开的问题。\n\n3. \"稳中向右、更加保守\"已成为欧洲政坛发展的趋势。尽管在反移民政策，右翼阵营与主流党团态度一致强硬，但在经济财政、气候政策、俄乌冲突、欧盟扩军等问题上双方有所不同。至于中欧关系上，欧盟对华经贸政策将更为保守，而极右翼人物在处理对俄或对华关系时将更加实用主义，不那么基于意识形态。\n\n文丨 国际政治专栏作家、中国翻译协会会员 胡毓堃\n\n▎

未来的欧盟要想团结一致应对地区安全等内外挑战，冯德莱恩的压力有增无减。\n\n若要理解冯德莱恩寻求欧盟掌门人何以出现悬念，首先要知道刚刚结束的欧洲议会大选（选出全部720个议席）及各大政党党团席位版图：\n\n欧洲人民党 党团 （189席，增加2席），欧盟历史最悠久、1999年至今第一大党团，汇聚了欧盟多国中右翼、自由保守主义、基督教保守派主要政党，立场亲欧；欧委会主席冯德莱恩、波兰总理图斯克、希腊总理米佐塔基斯等政要均属于这一党团；\n\n社会党 党团（136席，减少12席），欧洲历史第二悠久、欧洲议会第二大党团，成员为欧盟多国中左翼、社民主义主要政党，立场亲欧；德国总理朔尔茨、西班牙首相桑切斯、葡萄牙前总理科斯塔等欧盟国家领导人来自这一阵营；\n\n复兴欧洲 党团（74席，减少23席），欧洲中间自由派党团，持亲欧主义立场；法国总统马克龙、欧洲理事会主席米歇尔、荷兰首相吕特、爱沙尼亚总理卡娅·卡拉斯等欧洲领导人属于该党团；\n\n（由于都秉持中间、亲欧主义意识形态，并占据了欧洲议会过半多数席位，欧洲人民党、社会党、复兴欧洲被视为欧洲议会\"老三大\"和稳定格局的基石）\n\n保守与改革党团 （83席，增加21席），本次欧洲议会选举最大赢家，涵盖右翼到极右翼政党，持民族保守主义和自由保守主义意识形态，立场为温和疑欧主义（不反对欧盟的存在，但反对欧盟侵蚀各国独立主权）；意大利总理梅洛尼来自该党团；\n\n此外，进入本届欧洲议会的还有极右翼的认同与民主党团（成员包括另一大赢家 -- -- 勒庞领导的法国国民联盟），左翼的绿党/欧洲自由联盟党团、欧洲议会左翼党团，以及没有加入任何党团的无所属议员（包括极右翼德国选择党、匈牙利右翼总理欧尔班及其领导的青民盟）。\n\n▎ 欧洲议会选举结果统计。图源： POLITICO\n\n概括而言，选后欧洲议会形成的政治格局具有以下特点：\n\n就单纯的议席数量来说，\"老三大\"欧洲人民党、社会党、复兴欧洲的版图虽然再度缩水，但至少守住了欧洲议会的绝对多数（尽管欧洲人民党和社会党连续两届无法通过两方合作实现\"多数共治\"），维系了传统主流党团的统治地位而不至于\"变天\"；\n\n就成员国情况分析，极右翼党团的崛起不是体现在议席总数显著增加，而是在欧盟核心三大国法国、德国、意大利\"质的飞跃\" -- -- 德国选择党跃升第二、超越执政联盟\"红绿灯\"三党，勒庞的法国国民联盟和梅洛尼的意大利兄弟党更是成为本国在欧洲议会第一大党。\n\n凭借总体多数，欧盟现行建制派领导人连任自然是最具可行性的选择；可极右翼占据欧盟核心国家的主流中央舞台，又决定了冯德莱恩们不能不要其支持。 这便是欧盟领导人选悬念的背景源头。\n\n由此看来，冯德莱恩要想连任且不被极右翼势力绑架，只需要一如既往由\"老三大\"谈判达成一致，便可推出欧盟领导层候选人 ，并在欧洲议会顺利通过任命。 尤其是2014年开始沿用的\"领衔候选人\"制度下，最大党团欧洲人民党可直接提名冯德莱恩为欧委会主席，连任阻碍更小。\n\n▎ \"领衔候选人\"制度即欧盟委员会主席职位将由议会选举中得票率最高的政党担任。\n\n当然，既然要三大党团合作，那么欧盟领导职位安排离不开兼顾平衡。 以选前欧盟三大机构为例，欧洲理事会（相当于欧盟\"集体元首\"）主席为复兴欧洲的米歇尔（比利时），欧盟委员会主席（相当于\"欧盟总理\"）为欧洲人民党的冯德莱恩（德国），欧洲议会议长为欧洲人民党的梅措拉（马耳他）。\n\n重要性不亚于三大机构一把手的欧盟外交与安全政策高级代表（\"欧盟外长\"，自动兼任欧委会副主席、欧盟外交事务委员会主席），则由社会党的博雷利（西班牙）出任。\n\n基于党团、国家、地域甚至性别平衡的类似逻辑， 此次提名的新一届领导集体做出了如下安排：社会党的葡萄牙前总理科斯塔担任欧洲理事会主席，欧洲人民党的冯德莱恩和梅措拉分别连任欧委会主席和欧洲议会议长；而\"欧盟外长\"的职务，则提名东欧国家、\"抗俄前线\"的爱沙尼亚总理卡娅·卡拉斯（复兴欧洲）。\n\n按理说，如此安排既确保了中右翼阵营的主导地位、兼顾了三大党团、排除了极右翼势力，还在俄乌冲突的大背景下以卡拉斯的任命表明欧盟外交的主要关切。更不用说冯德莱恩与科斯塔关系甚好，领导集体的延续性、稳定性和团结程度必强于上一届。\n\n▎ 6月17日欧盟领导人就最高职位候选人的谈判破裂，无果而终。图源：美联社\n\n然而令人惊讶的是，就是这样一份理想名单，在6月17日的欧盟领导人非正式峰会上功亏一篑、未能通过。究其原因，不是因为外部阵营的干扰，而是因为欧洲人民党\"贪婪和傲慢的行为\"，差点毁了原本主动的\"大好形势\"。\n\n或许因为是\"老三大\"中唯一在欧洲议会扩大议席版图的党团，欧洲人民党觉得自己有更多谈判资本，比五年前提出了更多要求 ：不仅要在四大领导职位中延续已有的两大要职，还要和社会党平分\"元首\"职务任期 -- -- 不同于欧委会主席（五年），欧洲理事会主席任期为2.5年，但按照惯例会让同一党团人员连任、履职五年。\n\n这就是说，欧洲人民党要在四个大位中占据2.5个，反过来作为议会第二大党团，社会党在欧盟领导层的席位甚至还不如复兴欧洲（选举最大输家）。是可忍孰不可忍，社会党再怎么说也有德国、西班牙两个欧盟大国领导人坐镇，当然不会退让。\n\n此外，出于对选票支持率不够的担忧，冯德莱恩在大选前向右翼的保守与改革党团示好，本就令社会党相当不满。 现在需要拉拢社会党阵营，却拿不出分享权力的诚意，结果便是双方无法在6月17日晚上达成一致。\n\n值得注意的是，一位欧盟官员在批评欧洲人民党\"傲慢狂妄\"时，还直言在任欧洲理事会主席米歇尔没有为促成协议做出任何努力，而是\"不断地提出其他事宜\"。 这些年米歇尔与冯德莱恩关系紧张乃众所周知，二人多次在不同场合\"互相拆台\"。看着冯德莱恩\"玩脱了\"，米歇尔只会找机会\"使绊子\"，甚至把前者\"拉下马\"。\n\n堡垒容易从内部攻破，再加上其他诸侯的争夺，便会让相对简单的问题复杂化。 尽管\"欧盟掌门\"的名分归属是大家的共识，但权力资源的争夺要远远复杂得多。为了实现各自的争权目的，借欧盟领导人任命一事发难，不失为一种手段。\n\n今年最大的挑战者、意大利极右翼总理梅洛尼便是典型代表。 作为今年欧洲议会选举唯一一位取得大胜的欧盟大国领导人，她上来就对其他欧盟领导人将自己排除在外、秘密\"内定\"欧盟领导集体。用她的话说，欧盟领导人开会应该先讨论如何面对欧洲议会选举结果体现的新信号，然后由此讨论职务分配，而不是颠倒顺序。\n\n此话言外之意足够明显：安排新一届欧盟权力中枢，得让她所属的右翼阵营（保守与改革党团）分享胜利果实。\n\n事实上，梅洛尼本人还未开口，外界传言已经满天飞：她想安插意大利欧洲事务部长拉法埃莱·菲托担任欧委会（执行）副主席，力推资深外交官、意大利信息安全局局长伊丽莎白·贝洛尼负责欧盟的防务与外交事务......\n\n梅洛尼本人不会与冯德莱恩争夺大位，其阵营成员进入欧盟领导集体同样不太现实（毕竟得确保东欧国家政要至少得到一个领导职务），但她想要掌握主导权或话语权的领域如今可谓\"世人皆知\" ：经济领域的货币、贸易或竞争专员，新设立的防务专员（意大利拥有全球前十、欧洲第四大国防产业，武器生产与贸易是该国工业界的重要生意）......\n\n诚然，就算冯德莱恩无视梅洛尼，也不阻碍她获得多数欧盟成员国的支持 -- -- 按照欧洲理事会的\"合格多数\"标准，55%以上（15个）成员国支持，且支持的国家人口占欧盟总人口65%即可，但意大利毕竟是G7国家、欧盟第三大经济体和老牌大国，无人敢想象新任欧委会主席在没有意大利总理支持的情况下就职。\n\n在\"老三大\"阵营内部，也有人不想让冯德莱恩轻松过关。 在东西欧摩擦不断的情况下，欧盟总是要考虑如何让东欧成员国满意。这一次，欧盟资深大佬、波兰总理图斯克（欧洲理事会和欧洲人民党双料前主席）便成了内部发难的带头人。\n\n在欧盟大环境下，波兰的实力本就是东欧国家领头羊，特别是俄乌冲突以来东欧国家的分量显著增长。图斯克是欧洲人民党内仅有的欧盟大国领导人，而且在欧洲议会选举中扩大了实力，显然自视有足够的\"讨价还价\"资本。\n\n不同于梅洛尼阵营，图斯克手下的波兰外长西科尔斯基对防务专员一职无甚兴趣，因为在他看来这个类似于\"国防工业协调员\"的职务并没有\"防长\"实权。相比之下，图斯克乃至东欧阵营更想要的，则是欧盟扩军、交通等专员职务：前者与东欧的地缘利益息息相关，后者直接影响东欧与其他欧盟国家的贸易体量。\n\n欧洲理事会卸任主席米歇尔看到冯德莱恩\"出师不利\"，也不忘试探将后者拉下马的机会。 欧洲媒体已经传出，米歇尔心中早有关于欧盟领导集体的另选方案，即由希腊总理米佐塔基斯当欧委会主席，丹麦首相弗雷泽里克森（社会党团）当欧洲理事会主席。\n\n无论如何，新一轮\"三方会谈\"结果显示，冯德莱恩在欧盟获得的连任支持足够稳妥： 代表欧洲人民党团的图斯克和米佐塔基斯，代表社会党团的朔尔茨和桑切斯，代表复兴欧洲的马克龙和吕特通过视频会议确认了对冯德莱恩及新一届领导集体人选的认可。\n\n▎ 2024年6月27日，欧盟领导人在布鲁塞尔举行的欧盟峰会上合影留念。图源：美联社\n\n简言之，经过一番\"讨价还价\"的努力，波兰、希腊、德国、西班牙、法国、荷兰六国领导人已经确定支持冯德莱恩（囊括了意大利之外的欧盟五大国）。 这为欧盟领导人第二次会议奠定了基础。\n\n要说可能的节外生枝，或许会是下个月中旬的欧洲议会投票环节 ：由于冯德莱恩此前的言行伤害了社会党人的感情，可能有10%的强硬社会党团议员拒绝投票支持她，彻底斩断其连任之路 -- -- 按照欧盟制度，候选人一旦未能在欧洲议会获得多数支持，将不会有第二次机会，而是另行提名其他人选走流程。\n\n排除这一极端情况，冯德莱恩顺利再任后，面对的将是与此前五年明显不同的政治版图。 右翼和极右翼政党议席扩大是肉眼可见的事实，欧洲议会各党团之间又是松散灵活的合作关系，右翼党团随时可以在特定议题上从\"老三大\"内部挖墙脚、拉拢政党议员。为了确保法案通过，主流的\"老三大\"势必不得不在某些方面迎合极右翼的诉求。\n\n▎ 欧盟的极右党派分布，统计时间截止于2024年5月23日。图源：POLITICO\n\n由此造成的结果，便是一个稳中向右、更加保守的欧洲政坛，乃至影响未来欧盟多项内外政策的方向：\n\n反移民 是碎片化的右翼阵营难得的最大共识，并已经影响到主流党团的移民问题态度（趋于强硬）。\n\n在经济与财政问题上， 右翼阵营更强调本国经济主权和利益至上，导致不同国家的右翼政党因国情和诉求不同，难以就欧盟的财政与债务应对政策达成共识（例如德国选择党强调财政纪律，而意大利兄弟党则需要放松限制、举债经营），直接威胁欧盟财政政策的稳定性。\n\n气候政策方面， 保守与改革党团强烈反对2040年碳减排90%的提议，要求为采矿活动\"松绑\"，不同意为了恢复自然生态而影响农业生产；由于右翼政党和左翼绿党此消彼长，环保事业走\"回头路\"的可能性在增大。\n\n对于俄乌冲突， 欧盟的主流声音无疑是援乌反俄 ，但战争久拖不决，以匈牙利总理欧尔班为代表的\"选举赢家\"将继续质疑制裁俄罗斯的有效性，这种质疑的声音随着右翼势力的扩大而得到更多响应，例如斯洛伐克总理菲佐、荷兰极右翼政客维尔德斯。\n\n欧盟扩军 这一长期工程也面临着更多不确定性，本来随着俄乌冲突发酵，乌克兰入盟一事被提上议程，但对此最不支持的匈牙利、斯洛伐克、法国、奥地利都见证了本国极右翼影响力做大、成为欧洲议会赢家；加上这些极右翼领导人相对\"友俄\"的态度，意味着欧盟很难期待在未来五年扩军、纳入乌克兰。\n\n至于始终敏感的中欧关系，则可能呈现多元复杂甚至看似矛盾的走向。一方面，基于\"去风险化\"、\"降低依赖\"、贸易保护主义的逻辑，欧盟在对华经贸政策上会有更多保守色彩。另一方面，极右翼人物更偏向持实用主义，处理对俄或对华关系时，不那么强烈地基于意识形态色彩。\n\n法国《世界报》指出，代表勒庞阵营的若尔丹·巴尔代拉唯一一次在欧洲议会投票针对中国，是因为他认为后者对欧洲关键基础设施建设的影响过大。至于欧盟建制派关注的所谓\"人权\"等议题，他从来不予介入，为此还招致《世界报》等欧洲主流媒体的批评。\n\n美国政治新闻网站Politico认为，面对俄乌战争的威胁和特朗普在美国卷土重来的可能，欧盟各国都希望保持领导集体和政策的稳定性。不过冯德莱恩连任背后的故事表明，如何平衡各路诸侯的胃口，维系必要的稳定性和团结，显然是比连任更难的使命。",

        "summary": "The article discusses the challenges Ursula von der Leyen faces in her bid for re-election as President of the European Commission in 2024. Key points include:\n\n1. **Election Dynamics**: The recent European Parliament elections saw traditional parties (European People's Party, Socialists, and Renew Europe) lose seats but maintain a majority. Meanwhile, far-right parties gained significant ground in France, Germany, and Italy, complicating von der Leyen's re-election efforts and causing internal negotiations to be difficult.\n\n2. **Leadership and Power Distribution**: Leaders from Italy, Poland, and other EU countries are vying for influence in the new EU leadership, adding pressure on von der Leyen. Balancing these internal conflicts will be a significant challenge during her potential second term.\n\n3. **Political Shifts**: The European political landscape is shifting towards conservatism. While there is consensus on strict anti-immigration policies, there are differences on economic, climate, and foreign policies, including relations with Russia and China.\n\n4. **Negotiation Outcomes**: Despite the rise of the far-right, von der Leyen's re-election is supported by key EU leaders from Germany, Spain, France, and the Netherlands. However, internal party dynamics and the need to appease various factions, including the far-right, complicate the process.\n\n5. **Future Challenges**: If re-elected, von der Leyen will face a more fragmented and conservative European Parliament. This will impact EU policies on immigration, economic governance, climate change, and defense, as well as relations with Russia and China.\n\nThe article underscores the complexity of maintaining stability and unity within the EU amidst rising far-right influence and internal power struggles."

        "body": "几年后美国人会不会抱怨\"都怪俄乌战争\"？\n\n本周，美国两个重要的战略级项目传出坏消息，一个是\"哨兵\"洲际导弹项目负责人被解职，同时项目因超支受到国会严厉审查。另一个是美国空军对\"下一代绝对空优\"（NGAD）项目，也就是大家通常说的六代机项目的态度出现逆转，据称可能正在\"重新考虑\"项目前途。\n\n此外还有一个小小的附带消息，那就是美国批准了对台出售无人机，然而区区几百架小型无人机的售价竟达到几亿美元之巨，令人震惊。几年后美国人会不会抱怨\"都怪俄乌战争\"？\n\n综合上述信息，给人一种感觉，似乎美国的国防工业，尤其是新质战斗力、新技术发展领域出了大问题，那么我们该如何客观看待呢？本期军评咱们来盘一盘这几件事。\n\n\"哨兵\"洲际导弹是美国空军新一代陆基洲际导弹项目。尽管美国的核威慑自冷战结束后的大头就是\"俄亥俄\"级核潜艇上面的\"三叉戟\"导弹，但陆基导弹仍有着重要地位，陆基洲际导弹在核大战条件下承担的任务一是作为先发制人的打击手段，二是作为吸引敌人核攻击的\"诱饵\"。\n\n哨兵导弹到现在也只有这个图稍稍有点意义，就是它比\"民兵3\"要大，但是比\"和平卫士\"要小\n\n虽然地位重要，但冷战结束后，美国空军在陆基洲际导弹方面的投入并不多，马放南山了。\n\n迄今，这些导弹仍使用着上世纪70年代开发的机械式陀螺仪惯性导航组件。至于它们的指挥控制系统就更是老旧，一件被广为报道的事情是，其计算机系统直到几年前才换掉了5寸软盘，改成了现代的固态硬盘。\n\n在新一代LGM-35\"哨兵\"导弹 -- -- 此前叫GBSD（陆基战略威慑）项目的论证阶段，共和党强烈支持开发新导弹，民主党则不太喜欢，一直要求研究能否延寿民兵3对付过去算了。作为妥协，就是新的\"哨兵\"导弹要沿用民兵3的发射井，以降低成本，这才终于开始竞标。\n\n外界普遍认为，对于美国来说开发新型的陆基洲际导弹不会是难事。毕竟洛克希德·马丁公司的\"三叉戟\"海基导弹技术水平可以说达到世界洲际导弹领域的高峰，甚至海军已经规划将这种导弹延寿改装后装在新一代\"哥伦比亚\"级核潜艇上，要一直用到2084年。那把\"三叉戟\"相关技术拿来开发一个陆基版\"三叉戟\"，有什么困难吗？既然俄罗斯能把\"亚尔斯\"导弹直径改大，长度缩短，装进核潜艇里变成\"圆锤\"，对于美国来说，把三叉戟导弹直径改小，长度加大，塞进陆基发射井里，应该也没什么难的吧？\n\n也许技术上确实不是不行，但人家洛马压根不接这个茬，只表示作为子承包商可以承接部分子系统的研制生产。毕竟三叉戟人家吃的好好的，没必要再增加成本来搞GBSD。\n\n就这样一直拖到2020年，项目才算落实到了诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司身上，波音公司在早项目竞标阶段就骂骂咧咧退出了。因为诺斯罗普收购了\"轨道ATK\"公司，这家公司同时也为波音提供大型固体火箭发动机。换言之，即使波音中标，他们也得求着诺格为他们开发火箭发动机。\n\n诺斯罗普已经开始进行LGM-35A导弹的部分测试工作，图为准备进行测试的第二级火箭发动机\n\n诺格虽然拿到了项目，但其推进速度还是大大落后，原因也很简单，就是他们已经很多年没有开发过这种高性能固体大火箭了。虽然三叉戟导弹的火箭推进器也是他们开发，但那也是好几十年前的事儿了。此间轨道ATK公司（如今是\"诺斯罗普·格鲁曼创新部门\"）干的最多的事情，是翻新老导弹以及在老导弹基础上改改凑个新火箭或导弹，比如用侏儒小型洲际导弹技术开发GBI反导拦截弹，但这种修修补补、排列组合与全新开发一种新导弹完全是两回事。\n\n经过几十年马放南山，结果那可不就是一切要从头开始吗？\n\n所以2023年，美国空军部长弗兰克·肯德尔就表示目前对于GBSD项目来说最难的是\"我们不知道我们不知道什么\"(unkown unkowns)，以及\"重新制定标准\"。\n\n而到了今年，又爆出新问题，即发现民兵3导弹的发射井就地作为新导弹的发射井还不行，那都是上世纪七十年代的发射井了，别的不说，光是老化问题就很头痛。\n\n目前提出的解决方案是发射井重新浇筑混凝土，重新布线 -- -- 其实就是就地重建；但就地重建还得算\"拆旧\"费，发射井这种连核弹攻击都能扛的东西，要\"拆旧\"的难度可不是开玩笑，也得花大钱。甚至据报道称，现在这个项目还涉及将当年老旧的连接各个发射井和控制系统的电缆换成光纤的问题，而这些深埋的电缆系统要挖出来重新铺光缆，涉及到征地，光这一项成本就非常惊人。\n\n里外里一算，所谓\"沿用\"老民兵的发射井最后比另择地点新建发射井贵多了。\n\n但也没办法，国会老爷说了要沿用老井就得沿用。前面说了，这是政治问题，已经没人管最初决定沿用老井是为了省钱......结果可不就是严重超支和项目拖延嘛！2015年糊弄国会老爷的时候说只要600亿美元，到了2024年的现在，已经上涨到1300亿美元。\n\n老发射井改造计划，白色部分是改建新增设施，灰色为沿用老井设施\n\n不过\"哨兵\"项目的反对声音很有意思，由几位参议员提出，他们要求对\"哨兵\"项目\"是否对美国国家安全至关重要\"进行\"公平、诚实的审查\" -- -- 其实看一下这几位仁兄的背景就会发现 -- -- 说白了这是波音公司和民主党的反攻倒算啊。\n\n因为\"民兵3\"导弹是波音的，如果取消\"哨兵\"项目，就只能选择\"民兵3\"再延寿；波音公司早在退出\"哨兵\"项目时就向国会提交了抗议，其中附上了民兵3延寿项目方案：陀螺仪换成三叉戟同款的激光陀螺仪，全弹电子系统全面更新，固体燃料挖掉重新浇注，发动机也换掉，增加射程，解决不能带3弹头覆盖中俄全境的问题。至于指挥控制系统的电缆就干脆摆烂，不换了，只换计算机，发射井也就不必重建了，修缮一下就行......你看我波音的B-52轰炸机，空军要用一百年，想来也不差这400多枚民兵3了吧？\n\n当初大家都觉得波音提出这个方案也就是挽尊，只要诺格这边哨兵导弹开发顺利，波音就不大可能真正获得逆袭的机会，但你看，给你机会你不中用啊！\n\n\"民兵3\"导弹过于老旧，在1998-2009年间不得不进行了翻新以确保能用到2030年，不过没做多少技术修改\n\n至于NGAD项目，前几年大家看美国人折腾的也很热闹，提出\"新世代百式战机\"计划，要开发一系列快速迭代的概念验证机来推进项目进展，并且还通过各种\"泄密\"渠道明里暗里宣称其中的一些概念验证机已经开始试飞，今天给你看个CG渲染图，明天给你一个PPT，后天在网上发个模糊照片，总之那叫一个热闹。\n\n但问题是NGAD项目的参与方不让人省心，目前的竞标方还是上面洲际导弹项目中提到的老面孔，洛克希德和波音......\n\n怎么说呢？垄断资本主义国家是这样的。\n\n最近美国空军部长肯德尔（对，还是他）在接受《航空周刊》杂志和\"防务一号\"网站等媒体采访的时候表示，\"虽说目前我们还没有作出决定，但是我们正在考虑做出一些十分艰难的选择\"。\n\n本来呢，按计划NGAD项目今年就要决定花落谁家，选哪家都不存在\"十分艰难\"的问题；这十分艰难的选择，无非是还有第三种选项，就是项目黄了。\n\n此前波音一直都非常热心推进NGAD项目，尤其是之前他们还和海军一起搞了FA-XX项目，后来海空军几经谈判才同意先集中力量搞NGAD，之后再说海军战斗机。\n\n据\"防务一号\"的报道称，目前对于NGAD项目，波音的问题在于，美国空军现在不大敢相信波音，毕竟现在美国空军最头疼的就是波音的问题，你客机名声扫地也就罢了，你F-15EX能交得出几架？KC-46加油机问题解决了吗？T-7教练机搞定了吗？\n\n反正按照美国空军官员的话来说：\"迄今为止，波音公司未能替换他们有史以来最糟糕的高级管理层，即使公司其实已经决定了必须换掉他们......\"\n\n这话听起来很搞笑，但这居然是事实......\n\n也就是说美国空军现在对于让波音干NGAD这件事是很不放心的。\n\n波音现在，总让人有些不放心\n\n波音你信不过，那洛克希德如何呢？\n\n\"洛克希德没兴趣\"......\n\n好吧，你是不是觉得这句话在关于哨兵的情况里听到过？\n\n\"因为洛克希德在F-35上投入了巨大的成本，所以每次和他们提起NGAD，洛马就告诉你他们的F-35 BLOCK 4会有多少新的强大功能\"......\n\n说真的，以前看历史书的时候，对于英国一战后的海军发展特别不能理解，你说你堂堂世界第一海军，怎么主力还是一大票第一次世界大战时期的老船呢？你的\"前卫\"级怎么还用那破14寸主炮呢？为什么航母还用双翼\"箭鱼\"呢？\n\n现在看来，美国空军遇到的问题和当年英国皇家海军还真的是......历史重演啊。\n\n洛克希德：\"F-35block4就是六代机\"\n\n所以就目前情况来看，NGAD项目可能会取消。至于为什么取消，美国空军可能会找个技术原因。毕竟人家已经开始找台阶下了。\n\n\"防务一号\"网站的报道是这样说的：\"前瞻国际\"公司的航空分析师表示，虽然现在讨论NGAD项目是否真的会取消还为时过早，但美国空军领导层最近的信号是一个突然的转变，原因可能是经费，也可能是技术，因为目前来看，很多新技术发展，比如最近的俄乌冲突，可能让美国重新考虑是否还需要一种有人战斗机，从最近俄乌战争来看，有很多新技术可能取代有人战斗机，比如CCA（就是忠诚僚机的新缩写）、B-21、以及新型的制导弹药。\"\n\n怎么说呢，这转折是不是太突兀了点？这也能赖俄乌战争？\n\n你想不到的俄乌战训：能对付小摩托就行了，要什么六代机？\n\n说到这儿我突然有种预感，几年后，等到对美国而言真正的重大军事失败降临的时候，他们或许会和这两年抱怨\"一切都赖治安战，都是治安战带偏了美军的发展方向\"一样，转而大谈\"一切都怪俄乌战争，俄罗斯和乌克兰两个菜鸡互啄带歪了美军发展方向！\"\n\n治安战也好，俄乌也好，说到底都是借口，事情的本质还是美国本身在技术和工业实力上相对其他国家绝对优势的衰落。\n\n当然，具体到NGAD和GBSD，我们还可以很明显的看到\"一切都是体制的错啊\"，\"太伟大了，哈耶克！\"\n\n无限制的\"自由竞争\"带来的结果就是垄断，其实上面战斗机和导弹开发中波音、洛马、诺斯罗普的摆烂现状简直都是从马列主义经典著作中直接搬出来的案例。这就是典型的利用垄断地位，不再追求产品技术上的改良，而是赤裸裸地使用老旧甚至不合格产品赚取超额利润。\n\n最近美国批准的对台军售无人机也是一个典型案例。\n\n目前，美国批准对台出售的无人机有两种，价格总计6.6亿美元。但美国人批准的这两种无人机机型及其价格让人十分无语。\n\n第一种无人机是在乌克兰被批评为\"电子垃圾\"的\"弹簧刀300\"，这种无人机大家早就耳熟能详了，小螺旋桨无人机，数据链控制，全重2.5公斤，能携带相当于一个手榴弹的载荷。\n\n这种电子垃圾要3.6万美元一发，你敢信？\n\n这玩意美国人提供给乌克兰700架，基本上是转眼没，也没什么值得一提的卓越战果。毕竟这玩意灵活性不如四轴FPV，战斗部也不比它大，价格据称6000美元一架，还有价值3万美元的控制系统，也远比乌克兰自己用民用四轴无人机手搓贵得多，那玩意最多几百美元，然后你这\"弹簧刀\"数量还很有限。目前俄乌冲突中双方基本上一天就有几百架无人机互相对轰，700枚是糊弄谁呢？\n\n没办法，\"弹簧刀\"无人机诞生于2010年，正好是当代无人机技术爆炸的前夜，典型的\"时代的眼泪\"。\n\n当时几千美元能把一个手榴弹用无人机发射出去10公里，还能做到类似FPV的第一人称控制，确实很厉害。但2024年，这玩意就是妥妥的\"电子垃圾\"了。\n\n而美国人居然还能用这玩意赚大钱，这是我们想到的。\n\n因为这次批准的对台出售的\"弹簧刀300\"总共720架无人机和101套控制系统，打包价6300万美元......按照上面提到的，6000美元一架无人机、3万美元一套控制系统的价格算一下，总共不到1000万美元的东西，现在要卖6300万。\n\n不过话说回来，我们之前就说过，美国对台出售武器，只要是价格在国际通常价格10倍以下，就算是良心价......哦，这么看来\"弹簧刀300\"的价格只翻了6倍，\"你人还怪好的咧\"。\n\n另一种无人机，是\"阿特斯600MV\"，291架，3亿美元，这才是真正的杀猪刀啊！\n\n这玩意一百万美元一发！更过分！\n\n这玩意看起来是个大号\"弹簧刀\"，却是2020年才开始测试的新一代产品，属于美国新一代战术侦察无人机，航程444千米，重量9-12公斤，续航4小时，能携带1-3公斤的光电载荷，当然如果少带光电载荷，就可以带个一两公斤的战斗部了。尺寸规格同航天科技的CH-901类似，技术上，这玩意确实是有点东西的，同样是电动无人机，在同等载荷和高度、速度下，其航程和留空时间可以达到CH-901的两倍。当然，造价就远不止两倍了。\n\n这个无人机是在\"空射无人机\"项目下开发出来的，因此在2020年进行了从UH-60、C-130、AC-130炮艇机、P-3巡逻机等机型上发射的试验，后来还从MQ-1C、XQ-58A等无人机上进行了发射试验。美军的设想是未来可以由作战飞机和无人机携带这种小型无人机进行大量投放，形成蜂群，进行战术侦察任务。\n\n虽然载荷小了点，但一定要说的话，这种不算光电载荷可能也就万把美元的无人机，拿去当巡飞弹，美国人也是能承受的。比如美国向乌克兰提供的阿特斯600，就是作为\"巡飞弹\"援助的。只不过和俄军使用的\"小摩托\"比较一下的话，弹头还是太小了点，而且美国人给的数量也不算多，在战场上没闹出什么动静来。\n\n当然对台湾来说，\"阿特斯\"600最大的威力是价格，300架3亿美元。9公斤的无人机售价达到近百万美元，比它理论价格翻了近百倍，这可比\"弹簧刀\"的售价黑太多了 -- -- 今日纽约金价7.485万美元/公斤，9公斤也才67.365万美元啊。真是高贵的美国武器，厉害厉害，为你鼓掌。\n\n以如此高昂的价格购买这些电子垃圾水平的无人机，台湾当局的脑子是进了水吗？恐怕除了其中必然会有的贪腐问题，更重要的是继续\"装样子\"吧，给那些\"台独\"分子提供吹牛的理由：\"美国无人机！在乌克兰炸烂了俄国坦克！厉害不厉害！\"。\n\n此前美国说要让台湾成为\"刺猬岛\"，台湾就买了400枚标枪，2000枚毒刺，后来又买400枚鱼叉，这些数量远远达不到\"刺猬\"水平。因为对于台湾这样一个未来将面临远超俄乌水平的高烈度军事行动的地区来说，几百枚，小几千枚导弹，都是完全不够用的，基本上也就是一天两天内就要打光的程度。\n\n所以台军现在的状态就是\"装死\"，反正美国人都摆烂了，台军装装死混过去也没问题嘛。假装重视美国的各种建议，花大价钱象征性买点破烂，美国人和台湾政客都高兴就完了。反正仗打起来之前，那些\"台独\"分子只要有点因头能自己嗨起来。\n\n说起来也挺没劲的，在技术优势破产后，美军正在一路\"滑坡\"，现在已经到了要把这些\"廉价\"无人机当灵丹妙药的程度了，还张嘴就说\"俄乌\"。前几年刚刚起步的几个\"面向同等战略对手\"的战略级项目都弄得一塌糊涂，只顾着乐呵呵地到处去卖\"天价廉价无人机\"......\n\n廉价无人机最大的威力就是廉价啊，只要很低的价格就能出几千几万，所以不怕损失，拿无人机当炮弹打就是了。但你把廉价无人机卖出天价，虽然从赚钱角度说确实是大赚特赚，但真\"当那一天来临\"的时候，代价或许就是美帝国信用的彻底破产，到底是赚是赔，现在美国人似乎也已经无力做出正常判断了。\n\n美国人真正要面对的问题难道不是\"同等战略对手\"的\"对等技术\"武装起来的真正高科技大军么？俄乌到底哪里可以和未来的海峡相提并论了？美军现在也只能继续滑坡，反正到时两手一拍：\"哎呀，都是乌克兰害了我们啊！\"\n\n其实前几年治安战的时候美军难道不知道治安战就是个坑，\"斯特瑞克\"旅根本应付不了俄罗斯坦克吗？当然人家是知道的，但是造斯特瑞克、造防雷车能赚钱啊，美国传统汽车产业的最后辉煌就是造这些防不了反坦克地雷的防雷车，至于从阿富汗撤军之后直接扔给巴基斯坦多少，你管呢。\n\n这几年念叨\"都是治安战害了美军\"，那过几年就得念叨\"都怪俄乌战争打的太拉了\"\n\n无人机的道理也是一样的，美军不知道小型无人机未来战场上必须靠茫茫多的数量吗？美军不知道陆基洲际导弹需要更新吗？美军不知道他们的F-35打不过歼-20吗？那恐怕你太小看美军了。问题是你大头兵的命重要，还是垄断资本家赚钱重要？事情就很容易解释了吧。\n\n对于台湾当局，到是无所谓了，毕竟连他们的最高级政治人物都已经纷纷开始安排后路，现在的军购也无非是最后捞一笔的狂欢了，所以价超黄金的廉价无人机，这算得了什么？\n\n说了这么多，美国军事力量就那么拉胯吗？美国军事工业就真的完蛋了吗？\n\n那还是得说瘦死的骆驼比马大的道理。苏联解体都四十年了，今天还能从故纸堆里时不时翻出一些高价值的东西来，美国难道比苏联还不如吗？这也是太不重视对手了。\n\n与其关心小型无人机，不如多想想怎么对付远程火箭炮，毕竟美国人自己的火箭炮好像挺好使的\n\n其实和相关行业的朋友聊天经常能听到很多\"强美\"故事，比如同样的炮弹，美国人的炮弹装药比我们多，反过来说它的制造工艺也会更复杂，造价更昂贵，最后每年产量还远不如我们，但这不改变它确实在技术上比我们先进。至于其他水声电子、航空发动机、先进材料技术、芯片等很多其他领域，美国积累的技术都是让我们非常眼红的。\n\n所以制造能力衰落和技术领先这事儿并不矛盾，可能听起来挺抽象的，但事实如此。\n\n最后的落点还是老话，虽然今天的强敌看起来已是日影西斜，还拿着我们明确已经知道没什么意思的俄乌\"战训\"当\"滑坡\"的\"理论依据\"，确实有其可笑之处；但我们还是要看到，即使在乌克兰战况发展到如今这种状况，美国在西太平洋地区仍保留了相当实力。尽管近期又出现了\"航母空窗\"，但终究不是常态。\n\n所以不论如何，我们还是做好充足准备，才能在那一天到来的时候，雷霆万钧，一击制敌，毕竟趋势归趋势，历史总是存在偶然因素的，战场打不赢，一切等于零啊。",

        "summary": "This news article discusses recent setbacks in two major U.S. defense projects and speculates on whether Americans might blame the Russia-Ukraine war for these issues in the future. The key points are:\n\n1. **Sentinel ICBM Project**: The project leader was dismissed, and the project is under severe scrutiny by Congress due to cost overruns. The Sentinel missile is intended to replace the aging Minuteman III missiles, but the project has faced numerous delays and technical challenges, including the need to refurbish old missile silos, which has proven more costly than anticipated.\n\n2. **Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Project**: The U.S. Air Force is reconsidering the future of this sixth-generation fighter jet project. There are concerns about the project's feasibility and cost, with potential cancellation being considered. The article suggests that the defense industry, particularly companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, is struggling with innovation and efficiency.\n\n3. **U.S. Arms Sales to Taiwan**: The U.S. approved the sale of drones to Taiwan at exorbitant prices, raising questions about the value and effectiveness of these purchases. The article criticizes the high costs and suggests that these sales are more about political posturing than practical defense.\n\n4. **Broader Implications**: The article argues that these issues reflect deeper problems in the U.S. defense industry and military strategy, exacerbated by monopolistic practices and a decline in technological and industrial superiority. It suggests that future military failures might be blamed on the Russia-Ukraine war, similar to how past failures were attributed to counterinsurgency operations.\n\nOverall, the article paints a picture of a U.S. defense sector facing significant challenges and inefficiencies, with potential long-term implications for national security."
