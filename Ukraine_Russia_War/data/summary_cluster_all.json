        "title": "European Commission Competition Report Spotlights Potential Areas of Focus for Next Commissioner",
        "body": "Last week, the European Commission (EC) Directorate-General for Competition published a staff report on 'Protecting competition in a changing world: Evidence on the evolution of competition in the EU during the past 25 years'. We have read the report and believe that one can distill from it several principles that may guide competition policy in the next Commission:\n\nThe report appears to be the latest salvo in DG Competition's attempts to stave off dilution of its competition powers. The last significant part of this effort was passage of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation, which was borne in part out of a desire to avoid polluting competition policy with the political fallout which accompanied the Commission's block of the Alstom-Siemens merger (which was characterized as a merger of French and German \"champions\" to meet competition alleged to arise from government-subsidized Chinese manufacturers).\n\nThe report signals that the Commission's focus will be on the protection of competition and innovation competition (i.e., dynamic competition), particularly in sectors with existing high levels of concentration and clear signs of market power.\n\nThe report's conclusions in relation to lower income households and consumer-facing sectors suggest that these will be critical areas of focus for antitrust and merger enforcement going forward, with a potential goal of increasing the purchasing power of consumers to both reverse trends at the macro-economic level and improve competition. We expect that the EC may focus on these sectors in its enforcement strategy to send a message to other market participants.\n\nSpecifically for private equity deals, the report asserts that common ownership has been a structural driver for purported negative changes to competition, indicating a belief that common ownership (even at small minority levels) can influence competitive dynamics.\n\nWe do not expect any major changes in substance to the EC's approach in merger review. For antitrust enforcement, however, the report suggests a willingness to consider novel theories of harm whilst being open to discussion on effective remedies to protect innovation competition.\n\nBackground and summary of report\n\nThe Commission's report assesses the conditions of competition in the EU over the last 25 years and the main drivers of change, presenting new findings based on extensive economic research on the impacts on overall economic growth. The Commission draws on contributions from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a consortium of researchers led by economics consultancy Lear, and by the Chief Economist's team within DG Competition itself. It provides an update on the current factors affecting competition in the EU, the key drivers for this, and the impact of competition on economic outcomes.\n\nThe report, which was presented and discussed at a conference hosted by the EC on 27 June 2024, comes at a crucial political juncture for Europe. In particular, current European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will soon need confirmation from the European Parliament to renew her mandate. The vote is likely to be close. In exchange for supporting President von der Leyen, certain members of the European Parliament will likely seek concessions and there likely will be calls for a more interventionist industrial policy and more 'benign' enforcement of competition policy. These calls will likely be echoed in a report on European competitiveness expected to be issued by Mario Draghi (the former Italian Prime Minister and European Central Bank President) at the end of July. All of this will inform the selection of the next Competition Commissioner, the hearings in European Parliament of Commissioner-designates, and the EC's key policy priorities for the next five years. Indeed, there has already been mounting pressure to relax competition law enforcement in the next commissioner's mandate -- notably in the area of mergers, but also in relation to state aid. The report, however, may be one means by which current Commissioner Margrethe Vestager will try to resist this pressure.\n\nKey findings of the report\n\nOverall, the report finds weaker intensity of competition in the EU than in the past, with more pronounced market power and profit for firms at the top. However, the Commission caveats this with the finding that such weakened competition is still less pronounced than in other economies such as the United States.\n\nChanges to competitive intensity have been driven by both structural and institutional changes to how firms create value and compete in today's economy. The EC addresses how technological innovation, digitisation of business, public policies, and transformation in global supply chains (exemplified by China's re-integration into global trade) have changed the dynamics of trade and competition.\n\nThe second part of the report confirms and supplements prior findings that competition can have effects on prices and purchasing power of consumers, competitiveness of EU firms and overall economic growth. This is correlated to productivity, the most important factor for overall competitiveness and economic growth, with the research estimating that increased markups over the last 25 years might have reduced EU GDP by five to seven percent.\n\nThese key findings are discussed in more depth below.\n\nEvolution of competition\n\nThe report asserts that on average and in a wide range of sectors in the last 25 years:\n\nDrivers of evolution of indicators of competition\n\nAs changes to competition have been across many sectors of the economy, the EC suggests that the changes have occurred due to both structural and institutional drivers.\n\nStructural drivers. Structural drivers include rising investments in proprietary IT solutions and data, other intangible investments, globalisation, and changes to business conduct (i.e., M&A, oligopolistic pricing and behaviour, exclusionary strategies and common ownership by shareholders). In particular, the EC observes a link between access to intangible assets such as software and indicators of weakened competition.\n\n'Winner takes most' dynamics mean that large first-mover firms have been able to reap most of the benefits. The EC considers that this winner-takes-most framework initially enhances productivity growth. However in a second stage, it inhibits the process. That is, trends show that once a firm has established dominance through initial structural efficiencies, it then becomes easier to engage in exclusionary conduct, leading to high barriers for new entrants. During the EC's conference on the study on 27 June, Professor Nancy Rose at MIT Economics described this two-phase exclusionary behaviour as 'getting to the top and then pulling up the ladder behind you'.\n\nWhilst the rise in M&A and potential underenforcement are flagged by the EC, it doesn't attribute these to reduced competition.\n\nInstitutional drivers. Institutionally, the report observes regulatory barriers to entry and expansion contributing to these 'winner takes most' dynamics. In this respect, more vigorous competition enforcement in the EU as an institutional driver is attributed to less adverse effects than in the United States.\n\nRecent shocks to the EU economy are mentioned in the report, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine war, and rising inflation in the context of whether the EU competitive process is resilient and flexible enough to adapt to similar shocks in the future. However, no concrete conclusions are made.\n\nSpecific sectors of focus\n\nAcross 127 sectors, the report presents a scorecard of competition levels according to each sector's performance against the indicators of competition identified (i.e., concentration, mark-ups, profits, and measures of business dynamism). Having ranked each sector's degree of competition (according to the indicators), the report concludes that regulatory intervention has been most frequent in sectors with high competition risks based on the sectoral scorecard. Highest ranking on the scorecard include gas, telecoms, pharmaceuticals, rail transport, beverages, cement, and aerospace.\n\nAccording to the report, technological change and globalisation have had benign competitive effects on unconcentrated sectors or sectors where technological and business process innovations improve competition (for example, retail, car manufacturing and the manufacturing of semiconductors). At the other end of the spectrum, technological change and globalisation have, according to the report, led to a widening of the gap between leading firms and followers. Limited churn/dynamism at the top have been more detrimental to consumers in sectors such as consumer goods for household and personal care products, breakfast cereals, carbonated soft drinks, tobacco or beer, or in business-to-business sectors such as aircraft manufacturing, cement, and pesticides and seeds, according to the report. The report posits that sectors such as software and pharmaceuticals exhibit both benign and adverse consequences of such structural drivers, with technical progress simultaneously benefiting consumers but increasing barriers to entry.\n\nSeveral sector-based nuances bear mention:\n\nWhilst the EC has observed variances by sector, it has taken the view that intensity of competition in the EU is now weaker overall.\n\nImpacts on macro-economic trends\n\nThe Commission also considers effects on worrying macro-economic trends such as reductions in productivity growth, wage inequality, lower investments, and overall lower economic growth.\n\nMore effective competition resulting in lower markups, could have macroeconomic benefits in the reduction in price levels, increased household consumption and private investment, a strengthening of productivity and overall economic growth, according to the report.\n\nThe report estimates the weakening of competition since 2000 may have led to a five to seven percent drop in GDP, a four to five percent increase in prices and a one to three percent drop in productivity, with a potential worsened outcome by 25 percent were it not for EC interventions in the last 10 years. The report also estimates that implementing measures to limit market power of dominant firms may increase GDP by two to four percent.\n\nWhy competition matters for economic outcomes\n\nThe report posits links among competition, the competitiveness of companies and macro-economic trends, such that weakened competition harms productivity and long-term economic outcomes. The report also states that firms experiencing strong competition at a domestic level perform better globally, based on studies of successful export sectors. That is, domestic competition incentivises improvements to product quality, efficiency, and innovation.\n\nKey observations of the report's authors\n\nWe note the following key conclusions and messages in the Commission's report:\n\nSimilar findings, particularly in relation to increased concentration and its links to mark ups and profits, have been made in the United States, both by the Council of Economic Advisors in 2016 in their report 'Benefits of competition and indicators of market power' and the Chairperson of the Federal Trade Commission in 2018 in its contribution to the Quarterly Journal of Economics 'The rise of market power and the macroeconomic implications'. The 2016 report has since been cited by the Federal Trade Commission and the White House, including in the release of more stringent merger guidelines in July 2023.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority in the UK drew similar conclusions in its 2022 'state of UK competition' report, finding that the largest and most profitable firms are able to sustain their market position for longer than prior to the global financial crisis. This report notably conducted a more detailed analysis into common ownership and its effect on market concentration, and is similarly focused on end-consumer outcomes.",

Thank you American taxpayers,\" read sticker text on a photo of an invoice shared in a July 1 Instagram post.\n\nThe invoice shown in the Instagram post is to \"Mrs. Olena Zelenska\" for a preorder of a Bugatti Tourbillon with a total price of nearly $4.5 million.\n\nThe Tourbillon is a new car by the luxury automaker that will cost more than $4 million and won't be delivered to customers until 2026. But the invoice in the Instagram post isn't real.\n\nNicole Auger, a Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. spokesperson, told PolitiFact in an email that \"Mrs. Zelenska is not a Bugatti customer.\" Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, part of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, said in a thread on X that the claim is Russian disinformation that started in a French publication, Verite Cachee -- which translated to English means \"Hidden Truth.\"\n\n(Instagram post)\n\nEver since the U.S. began sending financial aid to Ukraine after the February 2022 Russian invasion, social media has been rife with claims that Zelenskyy and Zelenska have been using American tax dollars to fund a lavish lifestyle.\n\nAmong previous claims PolitiFact has debunked: Zelenskyy used American tax dollars to buy two yachts for $75 million (False); his net worth is $596 million (False); and that he bought a $35 million home in Florida (False).\n\nAuger said Bugatti normally doesn't disclose information about its customers, but it knew about reports that Zelenska bought one of its vehicles. This time, she said, Bugatti is making \"an exception because it is a false report.\"\n\nBugatti Paris, the official Bugatti partner in France, said in a statement posted July 1 on Instagram that the invoice was bogus and contained multiple errors, including the car's price, according to Meta's translation of the post.\n\nThe statement was from the Car Lovers Group, which owns Autofficina Parigi, the company that operates the Bugatti Paris dealership. The Car Lovers Group issued the same statement in a press release posted July 1 on its website. It said the company has filed a criminal complaint.\n\nThe statement referred to a video from a supposed Bugatti employee that was included in the Verite Cachee article and also shared separately in other social media posts. Analysts told CNN that the video has the markings of a deepfake, such as cuts in the video and strange mouth movements. The Center for Countering Disinformation also suggested it was generated with artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Verite Cachee website was created June 22 and many of the site's headlines are incomplete, with words such as \"Here is a short title for the article,\" according to a Google translation.\n\nOne article on the website about the Russia-Ukraine war appears to leave instructions on how to write the article with a pro-Russian slant.\n\n\"Here are some things to keep in mind for context. Republicans, Trump, DeSantis, and Russia are good, while Democrats, Biden, the war in Ukraine, big business, and pharma are bad. Feel free to add additional information on the topic as needed,\" the article's first paragraph said.\n\nThe Center for Countering Disinformation said \"Russian propagandists launched this fake before the NATO summit in order to discredit Ukraine's top leadership in the international arena.\" The NATO summit begins July 9 in Washington, D.C.\n\nAn Olena Zelenska Foundation spokesperson referred us to the X thread posted by the Center for Countering Disinformation.\n\nThe claim that Ukraine's first lady bought a $4 million sports car while visiting Paris with her husband is False.",

        "title": "Rocky Mountain Power proposes 30.5% electricity rate increase, points to fuel prices as culprit",
        "body": "Wind turbines generate electricity at the mouth of Spanish Fork Canyon on Sunday, Feb. 4, 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)\n\nRocky Mountain Power, the largest electricity provider in Utah, has filed an application to increase residential electricity rates in the state by 30.5%.\n\nIn its proposal to the state's Public Service Commission, the utility said the residential increase would be done in two installments, starting with one that would drive the average price of every kilowatt-hour from 10.96 cents to 12.89 cents, effective Feb. 23, 2025. Ultimately, the price would go up to 14.31 cents per kilowatt-hour on Jan. 1, 2026, according to a news release.\n\nBy Jan. 2026, households would be paying an additional average of $24.14 per month with the proposed hike -- an average $13.87 monthly increase per household under the first part of the rate raise, and an additional $10.27 per month from the second part.\n\nRocky Mountain Power cited increased costs of fuel and wholesale power, tied with ongoing new electric transmission and generation projects, for the rate increase. The company also mentioned escalation of wildfire risk insurance premiums as a significant reason to up rates.\n\n\"Like many businesses in these difficult economic conditions, the utility is facing inflationary pressures and increased costs outside of its control that cannot be offset through hard work and business discipline alone, making it necessary to seek a rate increase at this time,\" Dick Garlish, Rocky Mountain Power President, said in the release.\n\nFor non-residential Utah customers, the average kilowatt-hour would go from 8.18 cents to 9.5 cents on Feb. 23, 2025. Then, on Jan. 1, 2026, the company would further raise the 9.5 cents to 10.49 cents.\n\nThe goal is to increase rates to the overall amount of $667.3 million, the application reads, which would cover a base revenue increase of $564.9 million, in addition to $81.4 million for excess liability insurance and $21 million for amortization of deferred wildfire mitigation costs.\n\nIn a strong statement on his X account, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said he would work to make sure the proposal won't become effective.\n\n\"The proposed rate increase from Rocky Mountain Power would be laughable if it wasn't so dangerous. The proposal is completely unacceptable,\" Cox wrote. \"The audacity and lack of awareness with this request seriously calls into question management at RMP. I will do everything I can to make sure a rate increase of that magnitude never sees the light of day.\"\n\nHowever, this isn't a new approach for the utility. The company has proposed two-digit increases in other states it serves -- not always successfully.\n\nA proposal to raise rates by 29.2% fell through in Wyoming last year after Rocky Mountain Power acknowledged a major accounting error on its fuel cost calculations.\n\nAn agreement then allowed an increase of 5.5% for Wyoming customers which began in January and went up this month to 8.3%. The utility went back to the table in April to ask for an additional 12.3% rate increase, according to reports from WyoFile. The company later sued Wyoming regulators for the partial hike approval.\n\nResidential electric bills have remained fairly stable in the last decade, with annual bills for the average household only fluctuating slightly in the high $800 and low $900 range. Government officials have often cited studies ranking Utah as one of the states with the lowest electricity bills.\n\nBut that favorable ranking may change if rate increase of this size is implemented.\n\nThe largest drivers for the rate change are the \"significant increases in regional power and fuel prices,\" the application reads.\n\nMichele Beck, director of the Utah Office of Consumer Services, has seen an overview of the proposal and has experts looking at it. A full analysis of those calculations can only come after weeks or months of closer scrutiny, she said. But, as of now, she acknowledges that the drivers that are pushing the cost up are \"legitimate.\"\n\n\"The environment of the electric industry is changing very, very quickly. And so power costs are legitimately up. Investment in new resources raises rates,\" Beck said.\n\nHowever, while she was expecting a large number in the proposal, she was still surprised to see how large it was.\n\nSome of the factors Beck's office will also be evaluating include the cost for wildfire insurance and whether shareholders should take on some of that insurance risk -- as well as how the states that Rocky Mountain Power serves can share those costs, Beck said.\n\n\"Rate payers can be assured that there are multiple parties scrutinizing it, and we do get access to the data. It's just such a large number that even if we find mistakes, even if we say, 'not all of that should be included,' I feel like the end result will still be a large number,\" she added.\n\nMany factors are contributing to the increase in fuel prices, said Logan Mitchell, climate scientist and energy analyst at Utah Clean Energy. One is the Russia-Ukraine war, which has increased the prices of natural gas and coal. But there have also been issues with coal supply and demand that have been driving up the price of the resource.\n\n\"The (Cox) administration, the Office of Consumer Services, Division of Public Utilities, have an extraordinarily important role in this process,\" Mitchell said. \"But at the end of the day, much of these costs are coming from the cost of fuels, and so until we can invest in our grid and transition away from those, the most significant cost drivers, we're going to be stuck in a cycle of increasing costs.\"\n\nHowever, Rocky Mountain Power also notes those increased costs are \"mitigated by the company's investment in wind facilities and in the Gateway South transmission line, which allows for the deployment of additional capacity from Wyoming wind and coal resources.\"\n\nThe extra coal and natural gas expenses are also further alleviated by the utility's participation in the Western Energy Imbalance Market, which allows companies like PacifiCorp -- Rocky Mountain Power's parent company -- to buy and sell energy in real time, finding the cheapest alternatives. PacifiCorp saved more than $73 million during 2024's first quarter with this system, according to a Western Energy Imbalance Market report.\n\nFor Sen. Nate Blouin, D-Millcreek, who has worked in the renewable energy sector, it is \"reasonable to ask for those increases,\" he said. \"But to do it all at once is the frustrating piece.\"\n\nIn his view, the rate adjustment should have been done in a more sustainable way. He also doesn't see how Cox could counteract Rocky Mountain Power's ask, but hopes the commission is also ready to \"really give this a lot of scrutiny.\"\n\nAdditionally, though these calculations have included escalated costs for wildfire mitigation, the company may need additional insurance not yet included in the proposal. PacifiCorp hasn't fully considered how SB224, which establishes a catastrophic wildfire fund, will work either, so the cost can continue to go up, Mitchell highlighted.\n\n\"Our historic carbon emissions, including from our power company, are driving climate change, which is making wildfire conditions worse, which is driving up our electricity costs. So this is a direct cost of climate change that is now coming home to roost and affecting Utahns' electricity costs and rates,\" Mitchell said.",

        "body": "Gas prices could be about to get cheaper, just in time for summer road travel, as about 42 million gallons of gasoline makes its way into the fuel market.\n\nIn May, the Biden administration announced that the one million barrels of gasoline in the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve were up for sale. Contracts were awarded to five companies, and barrels were sold at an average of $2.34 per gallon. The gasoline was released to the contracted companies as of June 30.\n\nAmos Hochstein, deputy assistant to the president and senior advisor for energy and investment, says the release of gas should soon help drive down costs at the pump or, at least, prevent the price from increasing.\n\n\"It's not even oil -- it's a million barrels of gasoline directly into the gas market,\" says Hochstein, who is the leading expert and advisor to President Joe Biden on gasoline. By contrast, when oil reserves are released it still takes time to refine into gasoline. This action will move gas into the U.S. supply faster, but it's one that can't be done very often, says Hochstein.\n\n\"This is a one shot deal,\" says Hochstein, adding that it was timed before July Fourth to blunt the pressure on gas supply due to travel demands.\n\nFor context, 42 million gallons is about 11% of the total amount of gas that vehicles guzzle each day in the U.S., about 376 million gallons.\n\nLowering gas prices doesn't just benefit the average driver, it also means trucks that deliver supplies and food can run on cheaper fuel. Gas costs are factored into overall prices of goods, so cheaper gas can, theoretically, bring down prices -- or at least prevent them from going up.\n\nCheaper gas prices certainly can't hurt Biden, whose campaign is still reeling from last week's debate in which the president's performance was so poor it prompted a bevy of outlets to call for him to bow out of his bid for reelection. Presidents don't control gas prices, but they can enact policies related to drilling, refining and, in the case of today's news, releasing gas from reserves. Those actions can ultimately impact what drivers pay at the pump.\n\nGas prices have come down since hitting a peak in June 2022 when the average price for regular unleaded gas was $5.016, according to AAA, which tracks gas prices. As of today, the national average gas price is $3.501, according to AAA. It's up negligibly from last week's average of $3.469 and slightly lower than the average of $3.535 at the same time one year ago.\n\nThis release of gas should flow supply into gas stations during the Fourth of July rush. It'll primarily impact Northeast states including Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. But Hochstein says it could reach the Midwest, as well.\n\nThe Northeast will see cheaper gas because the barrels originate in the Northeast Reserve. \"When we sell this gasoline into the market, it loses value if you're trucking it across the country,\" says Hochstein. \"It is most valuable in the immediate area where it is in the Northeast.\"\n\nAverage gas prices tend to be highest out West with California ($4.790) leading the pack, followed by Hawaii ($4.702), Washington ($4.306), Oregon ($4.051) and Nevada ($4.035). On the low end, typical prices are found in Southern states led by Mississippi ($2.957), Louisiana ($3.028), Arkansas ($3.060), Oklahoma ($3.080) and Texas ($3.099).\n\nGas prices are set based on several factors including the price of raw crude oil -- more than half the price -- and the cost of refining that oil. The price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude is a bench market for oil prices in North America. Since its peak of $115 in the summer of 2022, West Texas Intermediate crude has fallen to around $83 today.\n\nToday's oil prices are influenced by global factors including the war between Russia and Ukraine and the war in the Middle East. Both areas producing oil and gas are under a lot of strain, says Hochstein. In 2022, following the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine, the administration announced a 180 million-barrel sale of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase gas supplies.\n\nBeyond oil and refining costs, gas prices also include a federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon and a state tax. On Monday, seven states hiked gas taxes.\n\nTiming of the release of this gas was critical, says Hochstein. That's because gas prices tend to go up during the summer largely due to several factors:",

        "body": "The recently concluded G7 summit demonstrated to the world that Europe and the United States are determined to deter the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia from further aggression, with sanctions introduced against Chinese entities, including financial institutions that provide economic impetus for Russia to maintain its war against Ukraine.\n\nIn the G7 communiqu\u00e9 released on June 14, \"China\" was mentioned a rare 28 times in its elaborating of the Chinese communist regime for threatening geopolitics and peace on issues such as production overcapacity, support for the Russia-Ukraine war, \"militarization, and coercive and intimidation activities\" in the South China Sea, and other issues.\n\nLeaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the European Union, warned the Chinese regime against its support for the Russian war, vowing in the statement to take \"measures against actors in China and third countries that materially support Russia's war machine, including financial institutions, consistent with our legal systems, and other entities in China that facilitate Russia's acquisition of items for its defense industrial base.\"\n\nLi Hengqing, a U.S.-based Chinese economist, told The Epoch Times on June 17 that this G7 summit has reached a consensus against the CCP, a focal point of interest different from the past summits.\n\n\"In the past, those Western countries more or less considering their economic, diplomatic, and political relationship with Communist China, have always dodged naming China (CCP), but this time the G7 has made a major change, sending a clear signal that 'if the CCP furnishes resources to the Russian war, then it will be made to pay a heavy price,\" he said.\n\n\"The U.S. is targeting the CCP as a counterpart bundled with Russia,\" said Henry Wu Chia-lung, macroeconomist and lead economics researcher at Taiwan AIA Capital\n\nMr. Wu shared during the New Tang Dynasty program \"Pinnacle View\" on June 18: \"The U.S. sanctions against Russia have gone through several rafts of escalation, and now they have been further escalated to expand the sanctions against Russia's financial system, including countries with which Russian banks have business dealings, with the obvious intention of targeting the CCP.\"\n\nIt included Hong Kong trading companies that \"route payments related to gold sales through foreign financial institutions back into the Russian financial system.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on key parts of Russia's financial infrastructure, including the Moscow Exchange, as well as its securities depository and the country's largest national clearing center.\n\nIn response, the Russian Stock Exchange suspended on June 13 trading in U.S. dollars and euros in foreign currencies and precious metals, as well as using these two currencies as financial instruments.\n\nOn June 13, the Russian central bank issued 14.2 billion yuan (about $1.96 billion) in loans to commercial banks in Russia for 174.2 billion rubles in a currency swap transaction. The day after, the bank doubled the limit of the currency swap to 20 billion yuan (about $ 2.76 billion).\n\nThe China-Russia Bilateral Local Currency Swap Arrangement was signed earlier in October 2014, when Russia was under sanctions by the West over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea.\n\nHowever, numerous agricultural and commercial banks in northeastern provinces bordering Russia, including Jilin Bank, Changchun Farmers' and Merchants' Bank, Changchun Development Bank and Yanbian Farmers' and Merchants' Bank, continue to provide \"a freer and more flexible settlement channel for border trade\" through the Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments System (CIPS) supported by China's central bank, according to multiple Chinese media reports.\n\nThe report said those banks shared ruble channel of Hunchun Bank's ruble channel, and \"given the transactions are mainly settled using the ruble as the currency, not the yuan, this system is outside the regulatory scope of the International Payment System (SWIFT) and won't be directly impacted [by the sanctions].\"\n\nIn this regard, Mr. Li indicated that these small banks are not directly connected to the SWIFT system, which does not mean that they can violate the U.S. and European Union bans and escape sanctions.\n\n\"If the Chinese Communist government continues to support Russia's war against Ukraine in this way, the West will eventually step in and impose sanctions on all Chinese banks. All Chinese banks are more or less state-owned, with shares linked to the Communist regime.\" Mr. Li said.",

        "summary": "The recent G7 summit concluded with a strong stance against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia, particularly focusing on deterring Chinese financial institutions from supporting Russia's war economy in Ukraine. The G7 communiqu\u00e9 mentioned China 28 times, highlighting issues such as geopolitical threats, support for Russia, and activities in the South China Sea. Leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, the US, and the EU warned China against aiding Russia, promising measures against Chinese entities that support Russia's defense industry.\n\nU.S.-based Chinese economist Li Hengqing noted a significant shift in the G7's approach, explicitly naming China and signaling severe consequences for supporting Russia. Henry Wu Chia-lung, a macroeconomist, emphasized that U.S. sanctions on Russia have escalated to include financial systems involving Chinese entities.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on key parts of Russia's financial infrastructure, leading the Russian Stock Exchange to suspend trading in U.S. dollars and euros. In response, the Russian central bank issued substantial loans in yuan to commercial banks.\n\nDespite sanctions, some Chinese banks in northeastern provinces continue facilitating border trade with Russia using the ruble, circumventing the SWIFT system. Li warned that continued support for Russia could lead to broader sanctions on all Chinese banks, which are largely state-owned.",

        "body": "The lack of underground shelter space for protection during a nuclear conflict is prompting people to invest in private bunkers.\n\nThe \"scare factor\" from potential nuclear fallout, especially with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, is a major reason why individuals are preparing for the worst, according to Charles Hardman, who runs the company Subterranean Spaces.\n\nSome of his clients include energy company directors, Middle Eastern royalty, and European car company owners.\n\nHe said that fear of nuclear conflict, especially due to the recent Russia-Ukraine war was a major reason for bunker purchases, though a desire to showcase wealth also played a role.\n\nHe said that very wealthy people wanted \"to tick the box\" with a Ferrari, an Aston Martin, a house in Europe, and a house in the UK.\n\nBut now, a nuclear bunker is \"something they can tick the box with,\" he said.\n\nMr. Hardman, who also has quite a lot of inquiries overseas, in Europe and Saudi Arabia, said that demand had \"plateaued\" in England, in part due to the fact that news coverage of the Ukraine war has dropped.\n\n\"The only reason people call up is if they get worried,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the wrong time; it's too late then. These things take eight to ten months to a year to build. People should be preparing now. The whole of Europe is getting them done,\" he added, citing Sweden, Switzerland, and Germany as examples.\n\nThough he warned that in the UK there's no preparation. \"There's nothing,\" he said.\n\n\"Israel has to have a safe room for every property. China and Russia have built vast bunkers for their populations, and yet, in the UK, they're like, 'No, we don't need bunkers,'\" he said.\n\nMr. Thompson's company fills a niche by building smaller, more affordable bunkers, ranging from \u00a320,000 to \u00a3150,000.\n\n\"You tend to have people who build bunkers for billionaires and millionaires, some of these are extremely lavish, with cinemas and swimming pools. But that's not what the everyday person can afford,\" he said.\n\nThough he said that the growing interest due to increased awareness of potential conflicts.\n\n\"More and more people are waking up to the fact that we are basically marching towards World War Three between NATO and Russia,\" he said.\n\nNuclear war followed by climate change were people's biggest concerns.\n\n\"We had them in World War Two, Anderson shelters, of course, they made a couple of million, but they did save millions of lives,\" he said.\n\nHowever he explained that the difference between now and then is that the humble World War II Anderson shelter was designed to offer British householders an afternoon of protection during bomb raids.\n\nBut in a fallout shelter, where you must hide from potential radiation, people may need to stay for two weeks or longer. Therefore, it has to be comfortable to live in, with sleeping quarters, cooking facilities, washing and bathing amenities, and entertainment and games etc.\n\n\"We had fallout from Chernobyl land in Wales, and we still have to scan the sheep today for radiation,\" he said.\n\nMr. Thompson's wife, a trained psychologist, provides video content to help people cope during crises in a potential bunker situation.\n\nHe said that planning permission is growing and depends on \"what area you live in and who you are.\" However, some clients may wish to remain tight-lipped about such a project.\n\n\"Do you want to advertise your bunker? Because when it all goes wrong, they are going to be in your bunker -- and if you've only built one for your family you can't support half the neighbourhood,\" he said.",

        "title": "Supreme Court's Broad Immunity Ruling May Empower Trump's Comeback",
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- In her dissent from a Supreme Court opinion that afforded former President Donald Trump broad immunity, Justice Sonia Sotomayor pondered the potential doomsday consequences: A president could pocket a bribe for a pardon, stage a military coup to retain power, order the killing of a rival by the Navy SEAL Team Six -- and be protected from prosecution for all of it.\n\nThe scenarios may sound part of an apocalyptic future. But the plain reality of the 6-3 opinion is that it ensures presidents have a wide berth to carry out official acts without fear of being criminally charged and it could embolden Trump, who was impeached twice and faced four separate prosecutions over the last year and a half, as he eyes a return to the White House.\n\nThe outcome is significant because Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has been public about wanting to pursue the same boundary-obliterating conduct that defined his four years in office, spawned criminal and congressional investigations and raised thorny questions about the scope of presidential immunity that were resolved largely in his favor in Monday's landmark opinion.\n\nRelated Story: Trump Says He Can End the Russia-Ukraine War in One Day. Russia's UN ...\n\n\"Over the long term, I think it will broaden what presidents are willing to do because they will see that there's a gray zone that the Supreme Court laid out,\" said Princeton University professor Julian Zelizer, who studies political history. The effect of the opinion, he said, will be to \"broaden the scope of what's going to be permissible\" and give presidents sufficient cover for acts that may veer into criminality.\n\nThe opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts did not dismiss the case charging Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential race, as Trump had desired, and it left intact the long-established principle that there's no immunity for purely personal acts. However, it significantly narrowed the case by finding that presidents enjoy absolute immunity for their core constitutional duties and are entitled to the presumption of immunity for other official acts.\n\n\"This is a full-throated endorsement of the unitary executive theory\" in a dramatic way, said Cornell University law professor Michael Dorf, referring to the theory that the U.S. Constitution vests extraordinary power in the presidency.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, the court's opinion means that the trial judge, Tanya Chutkan, must now engage in further fact-finding analysis to determine how much of the conduct alleged in the indictment from special counsel Jack Smith can remain part of the case.\n\nRelated Story: Manhattan Prosecutors Agree to Delay Trump's Sentencing\n\nImportantly for Trump, the one area the conservative majority said was unquestionably off-limits for prosecutors was his command of the Justice Department. That includes his directives to department leadership after the 2020 election to conduct what prosecutors said were \"sham\" investigations into bogus claims of election fraud, as well as his attempts to use the department's authority to advance his fruitless efforts to remain in power.\n\nThough the opinion doesn't make new law about the interplay between the White House and the Justice Department, Roberts affirmed that a president has \"exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials\" and may also \"discuss potential investigations and prosecutions with his Attorney General and other Justice Department officials to carry out his constitutional duty to 'take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'\"\n\n\"I do think that this is a norm-breaking opinion and I can imagine Trump using this as a basis for a complete destruction of DOJ independence,\" said Boston College law professor Kent Greenfield.\n\nThe position from the nation's highest court is welcome news for Trump, particularly as he and his allies have suggested wanting to use the power of the presidency -- including, presumably, the investigative authority of the Justice Department -- to pursue retribution against political enemies.\n\nAfter his May conviction in his New York hush money case, Trump suggested he might try to retaliate against Hillary Clinton, his 2016 opponent, if he returns to the White House.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be terrible to throw the president's wife and the former secretary of state, think of it, the former secretary of state, but the president's wife, into jail? Wouldn't that be a terrible thing? But they want to do it,\" Trump said in an interview on Newsmax. \"It's a terrible, terrible path that they're leading us to. And it's very possible that it's going to have to happen to them.\"\n\nMore recently, he reposted a meme that suggested that former congresswoman Liz Cheney, who as the No. 3 Republican in the House broke ranks with her party and voted to impeach Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, had committed treason and should face a military tribunal.\n\nRelated Story: How to Get Voters the Facts They Need Without a Trump Jan. 6 Trial\n\nThe posts and comments raise concerns given how Trump's interactions with the FBI and Justice Department as president shattered longstanding norms and became central to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether he had obstructed an inquiry into potential Russia coordination with his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump urged his FBI director, James Comey, to an investigation into a close ally and fired him weeks later, berated his hand-picked attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for having recused himself from the Russia investigation and also sought the termination of Mueller.\n\nIn his report, Mueller did not conclude whether Trump had illegally obstructed the investigation, in part, because of a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents cannot be indicted. But he did say that presidents were not \"categorically and permanently\" immunized for obstructing justice by using their presidential power.\n\nTo be sure, there are safeguards still in place that could prevent most presidents from testing the limits of criminal immunity.\n\nThe threat of impeachment by Congress remains -- Trump was impeached over a call with Ukraine's leader and Jan. 6, but acquitted by the Senate -- as do the practices, protocols and norms that govern Washington bureaucracy.\n\nRoberts, for one, sought in his majority opinion to downplay the impact, saying Sotomayor was striking \"a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the Court actually does today.\"\n\nBut even if the scope of presidential power is not directly expanded by the opinion, there's no question that it could benefit any president determined to abuse those powers.\n\n\"Not every president will take advantage, but the lesson, I think, of Donald Trump is: one might,\" Zelizer said. \"Or the lesson of Richard Nixon is: one might. And the 'one mights' are the lessons that you're looking for.\"",

        "body": "The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released data for May 2024 global passenger demand with the following highlights:\n\n\"Strong demand for travel continues with airlines posting a 10.7% year-on-year increase in travel for May. Airlines filled 83.4% of their seats, a record for the month. With May ticket sales for early peak- season travel up nearly 6%, the growth trend shows no signs of abating. Airlines are doing everything they can to ensure smooth journeys for all travelers over the peak northern summer period. But our expectations of air navigation service providers (ANSPs) are already being tested. With 5.2 million minutes of air traffic control delays racked up in Europe even before the peak season begins, it is clear that Europe's ANSPs have unresolved challenges. And the 32,000 flight delays over the Memorial Day weekend in May show that challenges persist in the US too. Airlines are accountable to their customers; ANSPs must be as well. ANSP performance matters to their airline customers and to millions of travelers. We all need them to do their job efficiently,\" said Willie Walsh, IATA's director general.\n\nRegional Breakdown - International Passenger Markets\n\nAll regions showed strong growth for international passenger markets in May 2024 compared to May 2023. The load factor increased in all regions except North America.\n\nAsia-Pacific airlines continue to lead the way, with a 27.0% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 26.0% year-on-year and the load factor rose to 81.6% (+0.6ppt compared to May 2023). This performance maintains Asian carriers as the largest contributor to\n\nindustry-wide growth in May, accounting for 42% of the year-on-year increase.\n\nEuropean carriers saw an 11.7% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 11.3% year-on-year, and the load factor was 84.7% (up 0.3ppt compared to May 2023).\n\nMiddle Eastern airlines saw a 9.7% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 9.0% year-on-year and the load factor increased 0.5ppt to 80.7% compared to May 2023. Asian routes to the Middle East are particularly strong, now standing some 32% higher than in 2019. Another notable development is the Europe-Middle East route, which saw an April-May RPK increase for two years in a row, reversing the previous historic pattern of a decline between these months. In the coming months, it will become clearer to what extent these trends could be related to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nNorth American carriers saw an 8.1% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 9.7% year-on-year, and the load factor fell to 84.0% (-1.2ppt compared to May 2023).\n\nLatin American airlines saw a 15.9% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity climbed 14.3% year-on-year. The load factor rose to 85.1% (+1.2ppt compared to May 2023), the highest among the regions.\n\nAfrican airlines saw a 14.1% year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity was up 8.2% year- on-year. The load factor rose to 72.3% (+3.7ppt compared to May 2023). This was the fastest increase in load factor among all regions, although Africa still has the lowest load factor overall.\n\nDomestic Markets\n\nDomestic demand increased at a stable pace in May. China's growth rate surged in line with the post- Labor Day holidays. Japan declined -1.8% possibly reflecting low business and consumer confidence.",

Increasing demand for IoT, data analytics and AI, especially generative AI (GenAI), is expected in the next two years. These technologies are poised to optimize production processes, improve equipment maintenance through predictive analytics and enable remote monitoring for increased safety and efficiency.\n\nOil and gas companies are also seeking technology solutions to support decarbonization strategies and energy transition. Governments are enacting stricter regulations to combat climate change, with policies such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the proposed European Net-Zero Industry Act driving companies to reduce emissions. Such regulations necessitate a shift in capital allocation, with investments flowing toward clean and green processes such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen production and renewable energy integration.\n\nIn addition, geopolitical events are altering global energy trade patterns. The impact of factors such as the Russia-Ukraine war on energy security and potential realignments in trade routes still remain a challenge for the industry.\n\n\"The oil and gas industry is facing a highly complex environment,\" said Iain Fisher, director of ISG Provider Lens Research. \"While fossil fuels remain a significant energy source, the winds of change are undeniable. Geopolitical tensions, the ongoing push for energy security and the relentless march toward a low-carbon future are all shaping the industry landscape.\"\n\nFor the study, ISG has distributed surveys to 37 providers of oil and gas industry services and solutions. Working in collaboration with ISG's global advisors, the research team will produce four quadrants representing the services and solutions the typical oil and gas company is buying based on ISG's experience working with its clients. The four quadrants are:\n\nEnterprise Asset Management, evaluating services and solutions providers that help oil and gas companies optimize the performance and utilization of assets throughout their lifecycle, increase production uptime and reduce operational costs.Next-Gen IT/OT Services, covering service providers that help clients in the oil and gas industry increase efficiency, ensure compliance and minimize overall costs, with offerings including infrastructure services, application development and maintenance (ADM), IoT-based solutions, cybersecurity, remote monitoring, digital twins and more.Data Management and Cloud Computing, covering providers of cloud data and process management, storage, application and master data management services to the oil and gas industry, enabling centralization of data and processes and transition from legacy systems.Energy Transition Services, evaluating providers offering services helping oil and gas companies achieve net-zero carbon transition targets, implement energy efficiency initiatives, and drive new business models for the evolving energy ecosystem.\n\nGeographically focused reports from the study will cover the global oil and gas technology market and examine products and services available in North America and Europe. ISG analysts Harish B (North America) and Mohd Aves Malik (Europe) will serve as authors of the reports.\n\nA list of identified providers and vendors and further details on the study are available in this digital brochure. Companies not listed as oil and gas service and solution providers can contact ISG and ask to be included in the study.\n\nAll 2024 ISG Provider Lens\u2122 evaluations feature expanded customer experience (CX) data that measures actual enterprise experience with specific provider services and solutions, based on ISG's continuous CX research. Enterprise customers wishing to share their experience about a specific provider or vendor are encouraged to register here to receive a personalized survey URL.

        "body": "Militaries around the world are beginning to restructure how they train their soldiers as methods of war continue to evolve in the high-intensity warfare environment demonstrated in the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nMost recently, the US Department of Defense awarded a $14.26m contract to Alutiiq Solutions on 1 July 2024. The company will provide I Expeditionary Operations Training Group (I EOTG) the ability to teach \"select special skills\" to US Marine Corps expeditionary units.\n\nI EOTG currently uses contractor personnel to provide the specialised training needed to deploy forces such as Maritime Raid Force training, sniper training, and uncrewed aerial vehicle training in order to prepare I Marine Expeditionary Force, Marine Expeditionary Units, Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Forces, combat advisors, and other designated deploying forces to support geographic combatant commands.\n\nJust as the Army has committed to changing its equipment and platforms best suited for counter-insurgency warfare to meet the needs of frontline infantry in a more direct conflict with near-peer powers, this must be reflected in how soldiers operate.\n\nThe contract will also see the contractor \"conduct and evaluate the collective training\" of the Marine Corps.\n\nThis commitment to evaluate soldier training demonstrates the changing face of warfare as infantry will need to change the way they fight to confront new innovations such as uncrewed systems, artificial intelligence (AI) and, in some cases, space-based assets.\n\n\"When everyone has all the equipment - both the Ukrainians and the Russians have jets, air defence, armoured vehicles - what really makes the deciding factor is the quality of the people, the actual human soldier,\" argued GlobalData Defence Analyst Tristan Sauer.\n\nThis comes down to Western training principles where responsibility trickles down to the lower levels of infantry, giving frontline soldiers a greater level of independence and decision-making.\n\nSauer added that this is where \"the divide comes between the quality of the Russian and Ukrainian forces,\" and this was true throughout most of 2022 and early 2023. \"But no one stays stupid forever when they're losing people\" on such a vast scale.\n\nControlling drones for all these people used to be the remit of the commander but we now realise that is no longer tenable. When you take out that commander, you take out that drone and a hundred people do not have coverage. So, the idea is that every small squad needs to have its own systems and the batteries to power them; it is important to promote self-sufficiency.\n\nBack in the West, the British Army has implemented a new vision for training its soldiers, known as the 'Land Training System' (LTS). This new structure aims to cultivate the sub-unit level with a wide range of skills and competencies in a combined arms environment.\n\nLTS is a programme partitioned into three development phases: Tradewind, Cyclone and Storm.\n\nTradewind will hone the skills and competencies of troops, with the aim of making training more self-sustaining; Cyclone involves building teams in which a sub-unit trains together (in a ten week timeframe every year) to master individual and collective skills; while Storm constitutes the scale and mass of 21 century fighting.\n\nThe Army aims to 'cyclone' 70% of its personnel by next year; and by 2027, the service will have fewer courses and more blended learning.",

        "body": "In a recent development, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on former U.S. President Donald Trump to reveal his plan for a swift end to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nWhat Happened: Zelenskyy, during a Wednesday interview, urged Trump to unveil his strategy for a rapid conclusion to the war, stressing that any plan must respect Ukraine's sovereignty, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.\n\n\"If Trump knows how to finish this war, he should tell us today,\" Zelenskyy asserted.\n\nTrump, who is leading in the polls over President Joe Biden for the upcoming November election, has promised to end the war by his potential inauguration in January. He criticized the billions spent on Ukraine's defense during a recent televised debate, claiming that Kyiv is \"not winning the war.\"\n\nSee Also: Elon Musk Calls Out New Yorker Piece Criticizing Joe Biden: 'So Many Dem Knives In Biden's Back Right Now\n\nZelenskyy expressed his willingness to meet with Trump to discuss his team's proposals. He also voiced his concerns about the delays in weapon deliveries from Western allies.\n\n\"They can't plan my life and life of our people and our children,\" he said.\n\n\"We want to understand whether in November we will have the powerful support of the U.S., or will be all alone.\"\n\nWhy It Matters: Zelenskyy's call to Trump comes in the wake of a series of events. In April, Zelenskyy had shown openness to Trump's suggestions for ending the war, stating that he would \"with pleasure\" consider Trump's ideas. In June, Trump's advisors proposed a strategy to end the conflict, which Trump reportedly responded positively to.\n\nIn a recent move, NATO has planned to \"Trump-proof\" Ukraine aid after Biden's weak debate performance with a $40B annual financial pledge and a new post in Kyiv. This move is aimed at safeguarding Ukraine's potential future NATO membership and countering the impact of a potential return of Trump.\n\nRead Next: Trump Ally Steve Bannon Says Biden Withdrawl Could Upend GOP Campaign, Describes First Debate As 'Pyrrhic Victory' For Ex-President\n\nPhoto by Dmytro Larin on Shutterstock\n\nThis story was generated using Benzinga Neuro and edited by Pooja Rajkumari\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",

The President was helped off the stage by his wife Jill after clashing with his Republican rival on topics including immigration, abortion rights and the Russia-Ukraine war. Biden's physical state and raspy voice drew scrutiny from both sides of the aisle, with one CNN panelist later claiming there was \"very aggressive panic\" among Democrats.

        "body": "China's economic woes, centered around a protracted crisis in the property market, have created an impression that weak real activity will show up in softer imports of key commodities. The reality, however, turned out to be the opposite, with the country now a key driver of global commodities demand, JPM Commodities Research said.\n\nIn stark contrast to the wider, faltering macroeconomic growth in the country, the imports of commodities by the world's second-biggest economy surged 16% in 2023, and staged a strong start to 2024, rising 6% in the first five months of the year, the investment bank said.\n\nThe trend, according to JPM, started in 2018 because of growing trade tensions during the Trump administration, but accelerated in 2022 with the start of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nAccording to JPM, China consumes almost 40% of the world's commodities, up from 23% in 2006, and is highly dependent on energy imports, shipping from abroad more than 70% of its crude oil feedstock and 40% of natural gas.\n\nETFs: (NYSEARCA:USO), (BNO), (UCO), (SCO), (USL), (DBO), (DRIP), (GUSH), (NRGU), (USOI), (NYSEARCA:UNG), (BOIL), (KOLD), (UNL), (FCG).\n\nNearly 80% of the raw materials needed to feed China's copper demand is sourced from overseas while raw material import dependence for aluminum and nickel currently sits around 65% and 95%, respectively, too, JPM analysts noted.\n\nAnalysts further argue, although China is a dominant player in global processing of commodities, it lacks sufficient upstream resources to satisfy its demand needs and its ability to control the value chain for major raw commodities has been historically limited.\n\nAdditionally, even as China accounted for 60% of the global EV sales in 2023, it relies on foreign suppliers for materials needed to make them, the brokerage added.\n\nElectric vehicle stocks with a presence in China: NIO (NIO), Li Auto (LI), XPeng (XPEV), ZEEKR Intelligent (ZK), BYD Company (OTCPK:BYDDF), Kandi Technologies (KNDI), Tesla (TSLA).\n\nThe brokerage further estimates, China's natural gas storage capacity will reach 85 Bcm by 2030 (16% of demand) on par with the U.S. that has around 130 Bcm of storage capacity, capable of holding about 15% of total U.S. demand. China's grain storage capacity is in line with that in the U.S.",

Indian media said Modi will be in Moscow next week, around the time of a NATO summit in Washington, at which Ukraine will be one of the main issues.\n\nWhile the West has tried to isolate Putin, China, India and powers in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America have continued to build ties, with official figures showing rising trade with Russia.\n\n\"It will be a good opportunity for Moscow to project in the media the image of President Putin receiving a leader of a country like India in the context of the Washington summit,\" said Aleksei Zakharov, a Moscow-based expert on India.\n\n\"India's objective is to ensure that Russia is not in China's corner and that, even if it does not explicitly support India, it maintains a permanent neutrality in the India-China territorial disputes.\"\n\nTies between India and China have been frosty since a deadly border war in 2020.\n\nThe leaders of Russia and India have held annual summits since 2000 but the last in-person meeting was in 2021, when Putin visited Delhi.\n\nThe next meeting had been due in Moscow in 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, but it did not happen, while Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping elevated their ties, pledging a \"new era\" of partnership in May.\n\nThe two are meeting at a security summit on Wednesday in Kazakhstan, to which Modi has sent his foreign minister.\n\nIndia has also been seeking to distance itself from its largest arms supplier, Russia, as the Ukraine war hobbled the latter's ability to supply munitions and spares.\n\nThe dearth of Modi's visits to Moscow had given \"rise to speculation that there was some kind of drift in the Indo-Russia relationship,\" said analyst Nandan Unnikrishnan, of the Observer Research Foundation think tank in New Delhi.\n\n\"So I think Modi's visit will put an end to that kind of speculation,\" he said. \"And we don't want to spoil our relationship with any party, whether it's Russia, the United States, or anyone because of another relationship.\"\n\nIndia's foreign ministry declined to comment.\n\nAt a regular press conference last week, it said, \"We have a very well established bilateral summit arrangement with the Russian Federation ... and are also preparing to hold the next summit.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Kremlin said deepening trade and economic ties would be a key theme of Modi's visit which was in the \"final stage\" of preparation.\n\nSpokesperson Dmitry Peskov said regional security and global security issues always figured high on the agenda of such meetings.\n\nIndia, which has stepped up purchases of Russian oil shunned by the West, is expected to seek a discount higher than the current rate of $3 to $3.5 a barrel during the visit, sources said.\n\nIt will also seek formal approval for a unit of Oil and Natural Gas Corp to retain its stake of 20% in the Sakhalin 1 oil project in Russia's far east.\n\nThe unit, ONGC Videsh, and the oil ministries of India and Russia, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIndia has also been keen to boost exports of pharmaceutical, machinery and other goods to Russia. Two-way trade jumped 33% to $65.7 billion in the last fiscal year that ended in March, with India's imports accounting for $61.43 billion.\n\n(Reporting by Krishna N.

Beijing has employed a mixture of military, economic, and psychological pressure against the island in service of its goal of eventual unification.\n\nAn ADIZ is self-declared airspace over land or water, in which the ready identification, location and control of aircraft is required in the interest of national security. But the zones -- also used by neighboring China, South Korea, Japan and the Philippines -- does not constitute territorial airspace and is not governed under international law.\n\nChina's military deployed 22 aircraft and six vessels around Taiwan in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. on Wednesday, according to the Defense Ministry in Taipei.\n\nOn X (formerly Twitter), one observer of the Chinese military noted that the no-go zone, while large, was declared for a short duration.\n\n\"A wild guess would be that it is probably going to be the first catapult take-off test\" of China's third aircraft carrier Fujian, according to user @foolsball, who added that the area resembled a \"big finger pointing\" to the Taiwan Strait.\n\nOn Monday, a separate navigational warning issued by Shanghai's maritime safety authority suggested the Fujian, China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, was due to conduct another sea trial in the East China Sea two days later, near the entrance of the Yangtze River.\n\nThe Fujian conducted its first sea trial on May 1. The flat-top warship is China's first carrier capable of catapult-assisted take-off, whereas its two other carriers, both of Soviet design, launch aircraft with ski-jump ramps.\n\nSatellite images showed the Fujian had returned to an outfitting dock on Tuesday. @foolsball speculated that it could be unloading aircraft mock-ups before sea trials.\n\nNewsweek could not independently verify the authenticity of the image.\n\nChina's Defense Ministry did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nLu Li-Shih, a former instructor at Taiwan's Naval Academy, said in a Facebook post that the upcoming sea trial would help the Fujian improve shortcomings identified in its previous test.\n\nHe also believed that the carrier would conduct so-called \"touch-and-go\" landing with aircraft for this round of trials, while actual landing on the flight deck would wait until the next test.\n\nTaiwan's armed forces will conduct live-fire exercises from July 22-26 as part of the 40th edition of its annual Han Kuang war games. Lessons learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war will be incorporated in live-fire drills, according to Taiwanese Maj. Gen. Tung Chi-Hsing.\n\nIn response, Beijing slammed the Han Kuang exercise as a \"show,\" in which independence supporters in Taiwan are doomed to defeat. The \"ending cannot be changed,\" the Chinese Defense Ministry said in its monthly press conference in late June.",

        "summary": "China has issued a no-sail zone warning in waters near Taiwan, citing military exercises in the East China Sea from Wednesday to Friday. This area overlaps with Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and is close to the Taiwan Strait's median line. The warning coincides with increased Chinese military activity around Taiwan, including the deployment of 22 aircraft and six vessels. Observers speculate that the exercises may involve the first catapult take-off test of China's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, which recently returned to dock after its initial sea trial. Taiwan plans to conduct its own live-fire exercises from July 22-26, incorporating lessons from recent global conflicts. Beijing criticized these exercises, asserting that Taiwan's independence efforts are futile.",

Martenson, PhD (Duke), MBA (Cornell) is an economic researcher and futurist specializing in energy and resource depletion, and founder of PeakProsperity.com.\n\nHe is one of a small list of favorites of mine that I am constantly reading and following on Twitter and on his site. He was also one of the first to sound the alarm about Covid in the U.S. while the mainstream media (and the rest of the nation) hadn't figured out the obvious yet.\n\nIn our 75 minute audio interview, we discussed a wide range of topics, including the potential for World War 3, the immigration crisis, the state of the economy in the U.S., our nation's response to Covid and looking back on the events of 9/11 more than 20 years later.\n\nChris told me right off the bat that he has significant concerns about the Russia/Ukraine war escalating due to the U.S. war machine making unilateral decisions: \"So here's the event that bothers me the most right now. A month ago, we hear that Ukraine has used some of their first long-range capabilities to attack Russia's over-the-horizon nuclear early detection radar system. One of them, right?\"\n\n\"A couple of weeks later, a second one. All right. Do you think anybody listening to this really believes that we voted for somebody who made that decision to target those things?\"\n\nHe continued: \"They didn't consult any congressmen or senators. There's like no presidential input involved. Somebody somewhere in the deep state said, you know what, let's blind Russia right now for nuclear attacks and hope for the best. Or what? I don't know what their plan is, but we can all feel it -- that we have an out-of-control machine that makes decisions that have nothing to do with what's best for you or me or anybody else.\"\n\nThe conversation then look a hard turn into discussing the deep state, the U.S. war machine and the events of 9/11. Chris and I both shared our concerns with the details we were given about the events of September 11, 2001, specifically regarding Building 7...(READ THIS FULL INTERVIEW AND LISTEN TO THE AUDIO HERE).",

Russia's United Nations ambassador says he can't.\n\nWhen asked to respond to the claim from the presumptive Republican nominee, Vassily Nebenzia told reporters Monday that \"the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\"\n\nAt a CNN town hall in May 2023, Trump said: \"They're dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I'll have that done -- I'll have that done in 24 hours.\" He said that would happen after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. And he keeps repeating the claim on the campaign trail.\n\nDuring last week's debate with President Joe Biden, Trump claimed, \"If we had a real president, a president that knew -- that was respected by Putin ... he would have never invaded Ukraine.\"\n\nTrump campaign's communications director Steven Cheung said Tuesday that \"a top priority in his second term will be to quickly negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\"\n\n\"Trump believes European nations should be paying more of the cost of the conflict,\" Cheung said.\n\nRelated Story: How to Get Voters the Facts They Need Without a Trump Jan. 6 Trial\n\nNebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 in Istanbul when Russia and Ukraine were \"very close\" to an agreement. Moscow invaded its neighbor two months earlier on Feb. 24, 2022, though Russia insists its \"special military operation\" began in 2014 after clashes in Ukraine's east resulted in Moscow seizing the Crimea Peninsula.\n\nThe Russian ambassador blamed Ukraine's Western backers for blocking the April 2022 peace deal and telling Kyiv to keep fighting Russia.\n\nNow, he said, Zelenskyy \"is running around with his so-called peace plan which, of course, is not a peace plan but a joke.\" While meeting in Switzerland last month, nearly 80 countries called for the \"territorial integrity\" of Ukraine to be the basis for any peace agreement to end the war. But some key developing nations did not join in and Russia did not attend the conference.\n\nRelated Story: Manhattan Prosecutors Agree to Delay Trump's Sentencing\n\nNebenzia pointed to Putin's offer on June 14 to \"immediately\" order a cease-fire in Ukraine and start negotiations if Kyiv begins withdrawing troops from the four regions annexed by Moscow in 2022 and renounces plans to join NATO.\n\nZelenskyy, who has vowed not to give up any territory, rejected what he called an ultimatum by Putin to surrender more land.\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment about Nebenzia's remarks.\n\nRelated Story: How did CNN's Moderators Do in the Biden-Trump Debate? It Almost ...\n\nAfter Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian forces thwarted their drive to the capital. Much of the fighting has been focused in Ukraine's south and east, where Moscow illegally seized four regions, although it doesn't fully control any of them.\n\nBut Ukraine is still struggling to stabilize parts of its front line after desperately needed military assistance from the United States was delayed for months before being approved in April. And Russia took advantage of the Ukrainian weapons shortage to launch an offensive and has made gains.\n\nNebenzia called Zelenskyy's peace formula \"a nonstarter\" and said he needs to be \"realistic\" and take into account what's happened since April. The more difficult the situation becomes for Ukraine on the ground, he warned, the more difficult diplomacy will become to end the war.",

        "title": "Aiming to Lower Gas Prices, Feds Boost Supply in Time for the 4th",
        "body": "Gas prices could be about to get cheaper, just in time for summer road travel, as about 42 million gallons of gasoline makes its way into the fuel market.\n\nIn May, the Biden administration announced that the one million barrels of gasoline in the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve were up for sale. Contracts were awarded to five companies, and barrels were sold at an average of $2.34 per gallon. The gasoline was released to the contracted companies as of June 30.\n\nAmos Hochstein, deputy assistant to the president and senior advisor for energy and investment, says the release of gas should soon help drive down costs at the pump or, at least, prevent the price from increasing.\n\n\"It's not even oil -- it's a million barrels of gasoline directly into the gas market,\" says Hochstein, who is the leading expert and advisor to President Joe Biden on gasoline. By contrast, when oil reserves are released it still takes time to refine into gasoline. This action will move gas into the U.S. supply faster, but it's one that can't be done very often, says Hochstein.\n\n\"This is a one shot deal,\" says Hochstein, adding that it was timed before July Fourth to blunt the pressure on gas supply due to travel demands.\n\nFor context, 42 million gallons is about 11% of the total amount of gas that vehicles guzzle each day in the U.S., about 376 million gallons.\n\nLowering gas prices doesn't just benefit the average driver, it also means trucks that deliver supplies and food can run on cheaper fuel. Gas costs are factored into overall prices of goods, so cheaper gas can, theoretically, bring down prices -- or at least prevent them from going up.\n\nCheaper gas prices certainly can't hurt Biden, whose campaign is still reeling from last week's debate in which the president's performance was so poor it prompted a bevy of outlets to call for him to bow out of his bid for reelection. Presidents don't control gas prices, but they can enact policies related to drilling, refining and, in the case of today's news, releasing gas from reserves. Those actions can ultimately impact what drivers pay at the pump.\n\nWho will see cheaper gas?\n\nGas prices have come down since hitting a peak in June 2022 when the average price for regular unleaded gas was $5.016, according to AAA, which tracks gas prices. As of today, the national average gas price is $3.501, according to AAA. It's up negligibly from last week's average of $3.469 and slightly lower than the average of $3.535 at the same time one year ago.\n\nThis release of gas should flow supply into gas stations during the Fourth of July rush. It'll primarily impact Northeast states including Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. But Hochstein says it could reach the Midwest, as well.\n\nThe Northeast will see cheaper gas because the barrels originate in the Northeast Reserve. \"When we sell this gasoline into the market, it loses value if you're trucking it across the country,\" says Hochstein. \"It is most valuable in the immediate area where it is in the Northeast.\"\n\nAverage gas prices tend to be highest out West with California ($4.790) leading the pack, followed by Hawaii ($4.702), Washington ($4.306), Oregon ($4.051) and Nevada ($4.035). On the low end, typical prices are found in Southern states led by Mississippi ($2.957), Louisiana ($3.028), Arkansas ($3.060), Oklahoma ($3.080) and Texas ($3.099).\n\nWhat influences gas prices?\n\nGas prices are set based on several factors including the price of raw crude oil -- more than half the price -- and the cost of refining that oil. The price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude is a bench market for oil prices in North America. Since its peak of $115 in the summer of 2022, West Texas Intermediate crude has fallen to around $83 today.\n\nToday's oil prices are influenced by global factors including the war between Russia and Ukraine and the war in the Middle East. Both areas producing oil and gas are under a lot of strain, says Hochstein. In 2022, following the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine, the administration announced a 180 million-barrel sale of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase gas supplies.\n\nBeyond oil and refining costs, gas prices also include a federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon and a state tax. On Monday, seven states hiked gas taxes.\n\nTiming of the release of this gas was critical, says Hochstein. That's because gas prices tend to go up during the summer largely due to several factors:\n\nHigher demand due to summer travel. AAA estimates that nearly 71 million people are expected to travel over the entire July 4 week, with 60.6 million traveling by car -- a record high. The switch to summer-blend gasoline, which costs more than winter-blend gasoline. Vehicles are less efficient during the summer months due to heat.Hot temperatures that can make it difficult to refine oil, as well, which can take its toll on gas supplies. Hurricanes and other extreme weather events in areas where oil drilling and refining take place.\n\nMore From NerdWallet\n\nWhy Are Gas Prices So High?Heads Up, Drivers: 7 States Will Pump Up Gas Taxes on July 12024 Summer Travel Report\n\nThe article Aiming to Lower Gas Prices, Feds Boost Supply in Time for the 4th originally appeared on NerdWallet.\n\nMore from this section\n\nSimone Biles headlines a U.S. women's gymnastics team eyeing redemption at the Paris Olympics\n\n'Artificial Wisdom' is a smash hit!\n\nCharles Symington is the New President of Primum Familiae Vini",

Amos Hochstein, a senior advisor for energy, emphasized that this release is a one-time measure designed to address immediate supply pressures. The release is expected to primarily benefit Northeast states but could also impact the Midwest.

        "body": "Gas prices could be about to get cheaper, just in time for summer road travel, as about 42 million gallons of gasoline makes its way into the fuel market.\n\nIn May, the Biden administration announced that the one million barrels of gasoline in the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve were up for sale. Contracts were awarded to five companies, and barrels were sold at an average of $2.34 per gallon. The gasoline was released to the contracted companies as of June 30.\n\nAmos Hochstein, deputy assistant to the president and senior advisor for energy and investment, says the release of gas should soon help drive down costs at the pump or, at least, prevent the price from increasing.\n\n\"It's not even oil -- it's a million barrels of gasoline directly into the gas market,\" says Hochstein, who is the leading expert and advisor to President Joe Biden on gasoline. By contrast, when oil reserves are released it still takes time to refine into gasoline. This action will move gas into the U.S. supply faster, but it's one that can't be done very often, says Hochstein.\n\n\"This is a one shot deal,\" says Hochstein, adding that it was timed before July Fourth to blunt the pressure on gas supply due to travel demands.\n\nFor context, 42 million gallons is about 11% of the total amount of gas that vehicles guzzle each day in the U.S., about 376 million gallons.\n\nLowering gas prices doesn't just benefit the average driver, it also means trucks that deliver supplies and food can run on cheaper fuel. Gas costs are factored into overall prices of goods, so cheaper gas can, theoretically, bring down prices -- or at least prevent them from going up.\n\nCheaper gas prices certainly can't hurt Biden, whose campaign is still reeling from last week's debate in which the president's performance was so poor it prompted a bevy of outlets to call for him to bow out of his bid for reelection. Presidents don't control gas prices, but they can enact policies related to drilling, refining and, in the case of today's news, releasing gas from reserves. Those actions can ultimately impact what drivers pay at the pump.\n\nWho will see cheaper gas?\n\nGas prices have come down since hitting a peak in June 2022 when the average price for regular unleaded gas was $5.016, according to AAA, which tracks gas prices. As of today, the national average gas price is $3.501, according to AAA. It's up negligibly from last week's average of $3.469 and slightly lower than the average of $3.535 at the same time one year ago.\n\nThis release of gas should flow supply into gas stations during the Fourth of July rush. It'll primarily impact Northeast states including Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. But Hochstein says it could reach the Midwest, as well.\n\nThe Northeast will see cheaper gas because the barrels originate in the Northeast Reserve. \"When we sell this gasoline into the market, it loses value if you're trucking it across the country,\" says Hochstein. \"It is most valuable in the immediate area where it is in the Northeast.\"\n\nAverage gas prices tend to be highest out West with California ($4.790) leading the pack, followed by Hawaii ($4.702), Washington ($4.306), Oregon ($4.051) and Nevada ($4.035). On the low end, typical prices are found in Southern states led by Mississippi ($2.957), Louisiana ($3.028), Arkansas ($3.060), Oklahoma ($3.080) and Texas ($3.099).\n\nWhat influences gas prices?\n\nGas prices are set based on several factors including the price of raw crude oil -- more than half the price -- and the cost of refining that oil. The price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude is a bench market for oil prices in North America. Since its peak of $115 in the summer of 2022, West Texas Intermediate crude has fallen to around $83 today.\n\nToday's oil prices are influenced by global factors including the war between Russia and Ukraine and the war in the Middle East. Both areas producing oil and gas are under a lot of strain, says Hochstein. In 2022, following the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine, the administration announced a 180 million-barrel sale of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase gas supplies.\n\nBeyond oil and refining costs, gas prices also include a federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon and a state tax. On Monday, seven states hiked gas taxes.\n\nTiming of the release of this gas was critical, says Hochstein. That's because gas prices tend to go up during the summer largely due to several factors:\n\nHigher demand due to summer travel. AAA estimates that nearly 71 million people are expected to travel over the entire July 4 week, with 60.6 million traveling by car -- a record high.\n\nThe switch to summer-blend gasoline, which costs more than winter-blend gasoline. Vehicles are less efficient during the summer months due to heat.Hot temperatures that can make it difficult to refine oil, as well, which can take its toll on gas supplies.

        "title": "Piasecki to hire hundreds for Chinook-based helicopter upgrades in Coatesville",
        "body": "Ukraine War, Russia sanctions speeds demand by U.S. allies, CEO says\n\nAround 200 of the workers Piasecki Aircraft Corp. plans to hire at its new \"Heliplex\" in the former Sikorsky factory near G.O. Carlson Airport will rebuild Vietnam-era Chinook helicopters for military and civilian use by the U.S. and allied nations, chief executive John W. Piasecki said Tuesday. He spoke at a luncheon to announce the venture at the plant in Sadsbury Township, near Coatesville, Chester County.\n\nThe work will be done in partnership with Columbia Helicopters of Aurora, Oregon, which plans a similar number of hires, said Columbia chief executive Dave Balevic, who joined Piasecki, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D., Pa., and other officials at the event.\n\nPiasecki so far has hired 31 engineers and technicians at Coatesville since agreeing to buy the facility last year. The company expects to eventually employ at least 400, including those who will work on the Chinook upgrades.\n\nPiasecki said the Russia-Ukraine war had prompted \"new demand from our allies\" for heavy-lift helicopters.\n\nAging Russian-built helicopters in the arsenals of former Soviet-allied states \"can't operate because of the lack of parts, due to Ukrainian War sanctions,\" Piasecki added. \"This has opened a window for Columbia and Piasecki to re-establish\" a program to update those helicopters.\n\nHe said Casey and other Pennsylvania representatives in Congress had pressed the military to support new helicopter research and help allies buy U.S.-made helicopters. Casey said military industries are important to U.S. national security and manufacturing employment.\n\nThe updated helicopters, Columbia Model 107-III, will include more powerful engines, glass cockpits, improved autopilot, rotor and fuel systems.\n\nPiasecki will remove old transmissions, rotors and other components, ship them to Oregon for refurbishment, and install new wire and cockpit systems, along with the refurbished equipment, then paint and test the upgraded helicopters, including flight testing.\n\nThe move comes as Boeing's heavy-lift helicopter division, which makes Chinooks at plants in Ridley Park, Delaware County and in Arizona, has been lobbying for more military orders to keep from closing its Chinook and Osprey production lines.\n\nBoeing's design unit, Piasecki, the Leonardo helicopter factory in Northeast Philadelphia, and other helicopter and parts makers have been lobbying for government contracts to build unmanned, electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft as drone warfare has threatened to make a lot of U.S. and foreign military equipment obsolete and sparked interest, and U.S. funding, for new designs.\n\nThe companies have a shared history. Piasecki Aircraft was founded by Philadelphia-born Frank Piasecki, a University of Pennsylvania and New York University grad who started building helicopters for the U.S. Navy during World War II, and is still controlled by family members.\n\nHis team designed the Chinook as a dual-rotor heavy-living aircraft, which Boeing purchased in 1960 and built for use in the Vietnam War, first at Piasecki's former Vertol plant in Prospect Park, Delaware County, then at the current Ridley Park complex between the Delaware River and I-95. That plant now employs around 3,500 and continues to update Chinooks for the Army, Air Force, Special Forces, and allied militaries.\n\nColumbia founder Wes Lematta bought surplus Chinooks, built by Boeing in Delaware County as the U.S. scaled down forces in Vietnam in the early 1970s. Columbia eventually licensed what it calls the Model 107 line of helicopters based on Boeing's Chinook airframe. Scores of old Chinooks are stored at an Air Force base in Arizona and are available to upgrade, according to Columbia.\n\nThat company operated six Model 107-II helicopters for the U.S. in Afghanistan, and has also sold and serviced the helicopters for use in the Philippines, South Korea and Switzerland, Balevic said. But production of those helicopters had trailed in recent years, before the recent interest.\n\nPiasecki and Balevic said their partnership will build a new Model 107-III helicopter. \"We will transform the heavy-lift helicopter industry worldwide,\" Balevic said, promising \"more fuel efficient, powerful and robust\" aircraft \"for decades to come.\"\n\nPiasecki said last year that it hoped to eventually employ 400 in all at the 219,000-square-foot Heliplex near Coatesville, while keeping its Essington headquarters and development center open as well.\n\nThe Columbia project will account for about half of the projected staff. Piasecki also presented models of alternate-fuel and training aircraft it has been working on and hopes to build at the Heliplex.",

        "body": "I had the wonderful pleasure of interviewing my friend Chris Martenson from Peak Prosperity this week. Martenson, PhD (Duke), MBA (Cornell) is an economic researcher and futurist specializing in energy and resource depletion, and founder of PeakProsperity.com.\n\nHe is one of a small list of favorites of mine that I am constantly reading and following on Twitter and on his site. He was also one of the first to sound the alarm about Covid in the U.S. while the mainstream media (and the rest of the nation) hadn't figured out the obvious yet.\n\nIn our 75 minute audio interview, we discussed a wide range of topics, including the potential for World War 3, the immigration crisis, the state of the economy in the U.S., our nation's response to Covid and looking back on the events of 9/11 more than 20 years later.\n\nChris told me right off the bat that he has significant concerns about the Russia/Ukraine war escalating due to the U.S. war machine making unilateral decisions: \"So here's the event that bothers me the most right now. A month ago, we hear that Ukraine has used some of their first long-range capabilities to attack Russia's over-the-horizon nuclear early detection radar system. One of them, right?\"\n\n\"A couple of weeks later, a second one. All right. Do you think anybody listening to this really believes that we voted for somebody who made that decision to target those things?\"\n\nHe continued: \"They didn't consult any congressmen or senators. There's like no presidential input involved. Somebody somewhere in the deep state said, you know what, let's blind Russia right now for nuclear attacks and hope for the best. Or what? I don't know what their plan is, but we can all feel it -- that we have an out-of-control machine that makes decisions that have nothing to do with what's best for you or me or anybody else.\"\n\nThe conversation then look a hard turn into discussing the deep state, the U.S. war machine and the events of 9/11. Chris and I both shared our concerns with the details we were given about the events of September 11, 2001, specifically regarding Building 7.\n\nChris told me: \"My PhD from Duke University is in a life science. But to get there, I took physics, I took chemistry, organic chemistry, all kinds of things, right? So I'm a big believer in chemistry. Physics and chemistry, okay? So with that said, there's some laws out there. There are natural laws, like the law of gravity. You can not believe in it. You can decide that you can cross your legs, float, but nobody does it, right? It just doesn't happen. It's this thing. It's like death. I'm gonna evade death. No, you're not, right?\"\n\nHe continued: \"Second, there's this law of the conservation of momentum, right? So if you're standing on a pond that's frozen over and I'm standing on a pond and you push on me, we're both going in opposite directions, right? It's just how it is. So when we look at Building Seven, if you were standing on the corner, any one of the four corners, it fell symmetrically like an imploding building, but leave that aside, that observation. If you were standing on the corner at the moment it let go, NIST itself had to finally admit that for two and a quarter seconds, that building fell at free fall.\"\n\nChris explained why this is so concerning: \"Meaning if you dropped a bowling ball into the air off the corner of the building at the same time that let go, it would track at the same pace. Like if you jumped off a bridge that was 88 feet high. Yes. If you jumped off that building, you and the corner of that building would be eye to eye staring at each other as it went down.\"\n\n\"That building had 80,000 tons of structural steel in it. It doesn't just go away. It can't, but it did. For two and a quarter seconds, there was no resistance to downward momentum. That's not... you can't crumple that. There's no possible way to begin progressively collapsing this thing. You can't do that. So we have to then come up with an explanation for how 80,000 tons of structural steel stepped aside and provided no resistance for two and a quarter seconds.\"\n\nAfter hashing out our thoughts on 9/11, our conversation turned to the forthcoming election. Martenson expressed to me that the election either could \"already be in the bag\" or \"not be happening\", two ideas I couldn't help but be skeptical of.\n\nChris told me: \"So what is the media not talking about? What's not happening that really ought to be happening? And on that front, you know what's really unnerving to me? Biden and Harris aren't really campaigning. You know, they just sort of weakly started lately. I was starting to see a few ads here and there, but it's lame. It's like they don't even care. And so how is it that you wouldn't even campaign? Well, one of two reasons. You're not worried about the election because it's already in the bag, right? Or there's not going to be one.\"\n\nTuring our attention to the problems the nation faces, we talked about the U.S. debt crisis and the nation's immigration crisis.\n\n\"We clearly have a runaway monetary fiscal train at this point in time, and it's just headed towards what I call the nuclear reactor critical mass runaway moment,\" Chris told me. \"Higher interest payments beget more borrowing, which begets higher interest rates, which begets higher interest payments. And you're on that spiral. That's the death spiral, which happens to companies, but it can happen to countries too.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We could have probably kicked the can another cycle or two, but now you have the rest of the world backing away, if not trotting away from the U.S. dollar, and people don't get it yet. China's negatively hoarding their treasuries, they're dis-hoarding right now. So China's selling. Japan's in a world of hurt. I don't know if you see, but the yen's here banging around at the 160 level again. So they're selling, and their big bank has to probably sell some treasuries. Russia, obviously not buying any of our crap -- they kicked that habit in 2018. But Saudi Arabia now not buying treasuries, dis-hoarding.\"\n\nAnd he raised questions about where, exactly, treasury demand is coming from, telling me: \"So who's buying? Well, you go to the Treasury International Capital Report. You find out, oh good, the Cayman Islands stepped in. Dude, we need an audit of the Fed right away. I don't think it's always suspicious to see it, no, because every time we need the Cayman Islands and the UK to step up and buy just hand over fist treasuries, somehow they do.\"\n\nFinally, Chris -- like most of us watching flawed policy unfold -- says we're definitely going back to QE: \"But listen, here's a prediction. It's very easy to make for me. The Fed's going to have to go back to QE. It's not just lowering interest rates -- that's going to do dick all for us at this point. They're going to go back to QE because we can't risk a treasury failure. We have $9 trillion of debt, new and existing, rolling through the auction market this next calendar year. And so the Fed's going to have to step in and start buying that stuff. Full stop. That's inflation.\"\n\nLast, we discussed some alarming facts about the ongoing immigration crisis in the U.S., namely the idea that there are tons of military aged men coming from countries like China and entering the country.\n\nChris thinks its part of a larger plan: \"Well, they're letting in the teams that are going to attack us and dismantle us from within when the war starts. I mean, that sounds conspiratorial, but God damn, if I can't help but think that. You know, military. It's the data. You can't exclude it out of hand. You just can't. Maybe not all of them. Let's say we had 20 million people come in over the last five, six years or whatever the number is now, right?\"\n\n\"What if just 10% of them are nefarious? They're MS-13 gang members who got disordered from a Nicaraguan jail, or they're actual SEAL team equivalents coming from China, Afghanistan, wherever, right? That's just 10%. Okay, well, there's 2 million people inside our country now who are poised to cause damage if called upon, right? And no one knows where they are and they don't have social security numbers. Nobody can track them. You know, it's just, you're a racist if you do.\"",

Moscow invaded its neighbor two months earlier on Feb. 24, 2022, though Russia insists its \"special military operation\" began in 2014 after clashes in Ukraine's east resulted in Moscow seizing the Crimea Peninsula.\n\nThe Russian ambassador blamed Ukraine's Western backers for blocking the April 2022 peace deal and telling Kyiv to keep fighting Russia.\n\nNow, he said, Zelenskyy \"is running around with his so-called peace plan which, of course, is not a peace plan but a joke.\" While meeting in Switzerland last month, nearly 80 countries called for the \"territorial integrity\" of Ukraine to be the basis for any peace agreement to end the war. But some key developing nations did not join in and Russia did not attend the conference.\n\nNebenzia pointed to Putin's offer on June 14 to \"immediately\" order a cease-fire in Ukraine and start negotiations if Kyiv begins withdrawing troops from the four regions annexed by Moscow in 2022 and renounces plans to join NATO.\n\nZelenskyy, who has vowed not to give up any territory, rejected what he called an ultimatum by Putin to surrender more land.\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment about Nebenzia's remarks.\n\nAfter Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian forces thwarted their drive to the capital. Much of the fighting has been focused in Ukraine's south and east, where Moscow illegally seized four regions, although it doesn't fully control any of them.\n\nBut Ukraine is still struggling to stabilize parts of its front line after desperately needed military assistance from the United States was delayed for months before being approved in April. And Russia took advantage of the Ukrainian weapons shortage to launch an offensive and has made gains.\n\nNebenzia called Zelenskyy's peace formula \"a nonstarter\" and said he needs to be \"realistic\" and take into account what's happened since April. The more difficult the situation becomes for Ukraine on the ground, he warned, the more difficult diplomacy will become to end the war.",

        "body": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin welcomes Ukrainian Defense Secretary Rustem Umerov to the Pentagon in Washington on July 2, 2024. (Drew Angerer/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced Tuesday that the United States will provide $2.3 billion more in military assistance to Ukraine, which includes missile systems, anti-tank weapons, and more munitions.\n\n\"Make no mistake, Ukraine is not alone, and the United States will never waver in our support,\" Mr. Austin said during a news conference at the Pentagon as he met with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov.\n\n\"Alongside some 50 allies and partners, we'll continue to provide critical capabilities that Ukraine needs to push back Russian aggression today and to deter Russian aggression tomorrow,\" he added.\n\n\"This package ... will provide more air defense interceptors, anti-tank weapons, and other critical munitions\" taken from U.S. military stocks, Mr. Austin confirmed.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media Sunday that Russia had dropped more than 800 powerful glide bombs in Ukraine in the last week. He urged national leaders to relax restrictions on the use of Western weapons to strike military targets inside Russia. In particular, he said, Ukraine needs the \"necessary means to destroy the carriers of these bombs, including Russian combat aircraft, wherever they are.\"\n\nMr. Austin did not refer to the aforementioned restrictions in his Tuesday comments, but he told Mr. Umerov that they would discuss \"more ways to meet Ukraine's immediate security needs and to build a future force to ward off more Russian aggression.\"\n\nAccording to a Council on Foreign Relations think tank analysis as well as the Committee for a Responsible Budget, some $175 billion has been sent to Ukraine since February 2022, when the Russia-Ukraine war began. A large portion of that -- $61.3 billion -- was sent to the Eastern European country in an April bill that passed both houses of Congress.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met with Mr. Zelenskyy during a public event in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, and asked him for a \"quick cease-fire.\"\n\n\"I asked the president to consider whether ... a quick cease-fire could speed up the peace talks,\" the Hungarian leader said at a press conference, according to local media reports.\n\nIn response, Mr. Zelenskyy said that he hopes for a \"just peace,\" adding that \"we appreciate that your visit takes place right after the start of the Hungarian Presidency of the European Union. This clearly indicates our common European priorities, of how important it is to bring a just peace to Ukraine.\"\n\nBut he stressed that he hopes that the European Union, of which Hungary is a member, will back his country.\n\n\"It is also very important for all of us in Europe that Europe's support for Ukraine remains sufficient, including our defense against\" Russia, the Ukrainian leader added.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram, \"Our cities and communities suffer daily from such Russian strikes,\" while saying that there are ways to overcome this that include \"destroying Russian missile launchers, striking with real long-range capability and increasing the number of modern air defense systems.\"\n\nHe also posted images that showed a large smoldering crater near a destroyed building, as well as pictures of bodies.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, Russia has not issued a public comment in response to Mr. Austin's announcement. Previous U.S. aid packages to Ukraine have been met by scorn from top Russian officials, who have suggested that the aid would lead to more deaths in the conflict.\n\nAfter the April package was passed in Congress, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters at the time that \"money allocated and the weapons that will be supplied will not change this dynamic,\" adding, \"More Ukrainians will die, Ukraine will suffer greater losses.\"\n\nThe Pentagon announcement was made about a day after Ukraine's security service announced that it had stopped what it described as an attempted coup that would have \"played into Russia's hands.\"\n\n\"Under the pretext of holding a so-called 'veche' [a people's assembly], the perpetrators planned to announce a 'removal from power' of the current military and political leadership of Ukraine,\" the statement said. \"Then they hoped to seize the building of the Parliament of Ukraine and block its work.\"",

        "body": "Donald Trump has repeatedly said he can settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Donald Trump has repeatedly said he could settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. Russia's United Nations ambassador says he can't.\n\nWhen asked to respond to the claim from the presumptive Republican nominee, Vassily Nebenzia told reporters Monday that \"the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\"\n\nAt a CNN town hall in May 2023, Trump said: \"They're dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I'll have that done -- I'll have that done in 24 hours.\" He said that would happen after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. And he keeps repeating the claim on the campaign trail.\n\nDuring last week's debate with President Joe Biden, Trump claimed, \"If we had a real president, a president that knew -- that was respected by Putin ... he would have never invaded Ukraine.\"\n\nTrump campaign's communications director Steven Cheung said Tuesday that \"a top priority in his second term will be to quickly negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\"\n\n\"Trump believes European nations should be paying more of the cost of the conflict,\" Cheung said.\n\nNebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 in Istanbul when Russia and Ukraine were \"very close\" to an agreement. Moscow invaded its neighbor two months earlier on Feb. 24, 2022, though Russia insists its \"special military operation\" began in 2014 after clashes in Ukraine's east resulted in Moscow seizing the Crimea Peninsula.\n\nThe Russian ambassador blamed Ukraine's Western backers for blocking the April 2022 peace deal and telling Kyiv to keep fighting Russia.\n\nNow, he said, Zelenskyy \"is running around with his so-called peace plan which, of course, is not a peace plan but a joke.\" While meeting in Switzerland last month, nearly 80 countries called for the \"territorial integrity\" of Ukraine to be the basis for any peace agreement to end the war. But some key developing nations did not join in and Russia did not attend the conference.\n\nNebenzia pointed to Putin's offer on June 14 to \"immediately\" order a cease-fire in Ukraine and start negotiations if Kyiv begins withdrawing troops from the four regions annexed by Moscow in 2022 and renounces plans to join NATO.\n\nZelenskyy, who has vowed not to give up any territory, rejected what he called an ultimatum by Putin to surrender more land.\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment about Nebenzia's remarks.\n\nAfter Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian forces thwarted their drive to the capital. Much of the fighting has been focused in Ukraine's south and east, where Moscow illegally seized four regions, although it doesn't fully control any of them.\n\nBut Ukraine is still struggling to stabilize parts of its front line after desperately needed military assistance from the United States was delayed for months before being approved in April. And Russia took advantage of the Ukrainian weapons shortage to launch an offensive and has made gains.\n\nNebenzia called Zelenskyy's peace formula \"a nonstarter\" and said he needs to be \"realistic\" and take into account what's happened since April. The more difficult the situation becomes for Ukraine on the ground, he warned, the more difficult diplomacy will become to end the war.",

Nebenzia argued that a potential peace deal in April 2022 was blocked by Ukraine's Western allies and criticized Zelenskyy's current peace plan. He also mentioned Putin's offer for a cease-fire if Ukraine withdraws from annexed regions and renounces NATO ambitions, which Zelenskyy rejected. The Trump campaign emphasized that negotiating an end to the war would be a priority in a second term, with a focus on European nations bearing more conflict costs.

        "title": "Foreign professor fired from Chinese university after interview with VOA",
        "body": "Bj\u00f6rn Alexander D\u00fcben, a German assistant professor at Jilin University's School of Public Diplomacy, was mysteriously dismissed and instructed to leave China after a nine-year tenure, following his participation in an interview with Voice of America (VOA). This dismissal highlights the severe restrictions on free speech imposed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nD\u00fcben's troubles began shortly after he commented on Chinese leader Xi Jinping's visit to Europe in an article published by VOA Mandarin on May 11. The next day, he received a WeChat message from the university's international secretary, which stated, \"It is well known that colleges and universities must be responsible for any form of interviews with domestic and foreign media.\" This message hinted at the sensitive nature of his comments regarding the Chinese leadership.\n\nOn May 15, D\u00fcben was informed that his classes for the day were suspended due to all classrooms being occupied. Shortly after, a colleague informed him that not only were his classes canceled indefinitely, but his employment was also being terminated, citing decisions made by \"unspecified higher-level authorities.\" D\u00fcben was also told that his China Talent visa, which was valid until 2033, would be canceled unless he chose to resign or face a disciplinary inquiry, both of which would likely lead to his dismissal.\n\nFeeling cornered and fearing repercussions from contesting the decision, D\u00fcben chose to resign. Following his resignation, he was told he could retain his visa but had to leave China by May 30 and would be barred from re-entering the country. The university administrator indicated that these were instructions from \"above,\" allowing no room for negotiation.\n\nThis incident wasn't D\u00fcben's first foray into media commentary. Over the years, he had frequently provided insights on sensitive topics related to China's foreign policy for various international outlets, including Reuters and The Diplomat, a current affairs magazine. However, his comments on Xi Jinping's visit, despite being similar in nature to his previous commentary, triggered unprecedented consequences, possibly due to the current heightened political sensitivities in China.\n\nEric, who did not provide a last name, is a former agent of the Political Security Bureau of China's Ministry of Public Security who has since fled to Australia. He shed light on the possible internal reactions to D\u00fcben's comments. He suggested that such statements could be seen as offensive by Chinese authorities, particularly if they perceive them as undermining the image of the CCP or its leaders. Eric explained, \"After your report came out, anyone who sees it, such as Chinese media correspondents stationed abroad or other officials, may report the public opinion involving the number one leader to their superiors... The senior leaders of the superior department will think the situation is serious and initiate countermeasures, such as deciding to expel the person mentioned in the article from the country.\"\n\nFurthermore, D\u00fcben commented on the Russia-Ukraine war in the VOA story, noting that \"Russia has long been short of basic ammunition, but now many supply loopholes have been plugged,\" and \"Russia currently needs the most parts that China can provide but is difficult to track specific dual-use parts.\" Eric said the comment on the loopholes needs fact-checking. \"If it's not true, the Chinese government will think it is a frame-up and smear, and the anger of being wronged can easily lead to retaliation. If true, how can an ordinary assistant professor come to this conclusion?\"\n\nThe conditions of D\u00fcben's employment contract at Jilin University, which mandated adherence to China's sovereignty and social order and prohibited any activities that could disrupt academic or ideological norms, were also noted. These vague clauses could have been weaponized against him, impacting his legal standing and complicating any defense he might mount in a legal challenge against his dismissal.\n\nErika Staffas Edstr\u00f6m, an analyst at the Swedish National China Center at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, commented on the broader implications of such incidents. She told VOA, \"It is clear that the Chinese Communist Party has stepped up its efforts to strengthen its control on global discourse and information in recent years. However, it is too early to say whether this specific incident represents another step by the Chinese Communist Party to strengthen its control over free speech.\"\n\nOverall, D\u00fcben's case exemplifies the increasing challenges that foreign academics face in China, where political sensitivities can trigger harsh reactions from authorities, leading to censorship and suppression of academic freedom. This incident not only affects D\u00fcben but also serves as a warning to the international academic and diplomatic communities about the risks of engaging in sensitive discussions related to China's political landscape.",

        "body": "This report recommends actions for the new leadership of Taiwan to take to enhance its societal resilience against Chinese aggression in the context of both \"gray zone\" conflict and wartime attacks. The report focuses on establishing a comprehensive security strategy and analyzes three key areas particularly important for effective resilience: enhancing cybersecurity for critical infrastructures; improving energy security; and accelerating defense transformation.\n\nThe new administration of Lai Ching-te faces both existing resilience challenges and the potential for significantly greater problems if the People's Republic of China (PRC) pursues expanded gray zone activities or if actual conflict occurs.\"The gray zone describes a set of activities that occur between peace (or cooperation) and war (or armed conflict),\" writes Clementine Starling. \"A multitude of activities fall into this murky in-between -- from nefarious economic activities, influence operations, and cyberattacks to mercenary operations, assassinations, and disinformation campaigns. Generally, gray-zone activities are considered gradualist campaigns by state and non-state actors that combine non-military and quasi-military tools and fall below the threshold of armed conflict. They aim to thwart, destabilize, weaken, or attack an adversary, and they are often tailored toward the vulnerabilities of the target state. While gray-zone activities are nothing new, the onset of new technologies has provided states with more tools to operate and avoid clear categorization, attribution, and detection -- all of which complicates the United States' and its allies' ability to respond.\" Starling, \"Today's Wars Are Fought in the 'Gray Zone.' Here's Everything You Need to Know About it,\" Atlantic Council, February 23, 2022, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/todays-wars-are-fought-in-the-gray-zone-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-it/. The ongoing challenges include substantial disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks, military incursions, and periodic economic coercion. Potential future challenges could involve expansion of one or more of these ongoing Chinese activities. In the context of a more contested environment such as a quarantine,In a quarantine of Taiwan, Beijing would interdict shipments but allow some supplies -- potentially food and medicine -- to pass through unimpeded. This measure would enable the PRC to assert greater sovereignty over Taiwan without formally committing to either a war or a blockade. blockade, or a kinetic conflict, Chinese actions could seek to cause leadership failures and loss of social cohesion; undertake cyberattacks to target critical infrastructures; generate energy shortages; and seek to defeat Taiwan militarily before the United States could provide effective support. The potential for such harms substantially increases the importance of resilient responses by Taiwan.\n\nThe report recommends four major sets of actions to enhance Taiwan's resilience:\n\nResilience is not a new theme in Taiwan. Former President Tsai Ing-wen, who completed two terms in office on May 20, entitled her 2022 National Day Address \"Island of Resilience,\"\"President Tsai Delivers 2022 National Day Address,\" Office of the President of Taiwan, October 10, 2022, https://english.president.gov.tw/News/6348. and similarly identified resilience as a key factor for Taiwan in her two subsequent National Day addresses.\"Full Text of President Tsai Ing-Wen's National Day Address,\" Focus Taiwan website, Central News Agency of Taiwan, October 10, 2023, https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202310100004; and \"President Tsai Delivers 2024 New Year's Address,\" Office of the President, Taiwan, January 1, 2024, https://english.president.gov.tw/NEWS/6662. \"The work of making the Republic of China (Taiwan) a more resilient country is now our most important national development priority,\" she stated in that 2022 speech, in which she articulated four key areas of resilience: economy and industry, social safety net, free and democratic government system, and national defense. What is left undone, however, is aligning these and other resilience elements into a comprehensive security strategy similar to those undertaken by FinlandFinnish Security Committee, Security Strategy for Society: Government Resolution, Ministry of Defense, November 2, 2017, https://turvallisuuskomitea.fi/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/YTS_2017_english.pdf. and Sweden,\"Swedish Defence Commission Submits Total Defence Report,\" Ministry of Defense, December 19, 2023, https://www.government.se/articles/2023/12/swedish-defence-commission-submits-total-defence-report/. which utilize a whole-of society approach to enhance resilience.\n\nResilience is a nation's ability to understand, address, respond to, and recover from any type of national security risk. Given the scale of risk Taiwan faces from China, domestic resilience should be front and center in Taiwan's national security strategy.Pursuing a professional and structured approach to resilience against Chinese aggression will also have a \"halo\" effect, building approaches and expertise that will support effective work on other areas of national security risk. Comparable comprehensive national security approaches, such as the Finnish model, aim to foster and enable an engaged national ecosystem of partners, each with a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities. Finland's model is instructive, underscoring the importance of engagement by the entire society:\n\nComprehensive security thus is far more than just government activities:\n\nThe Finnish strategy identifies seven \"vital functions\" as key areas: leadership; international and European Union activities; defense capability; internal security; economy, infrastructure, and security of supply; functional capacity of the population and services; and psychological resilience.Finnish Security Committee, Security Strategy for Society.\n\nTaiwan has taken a variety of actions to enhance resilience including the establishment in 2022 of the All-out Defense Mobilization Agency.\"All-out Defense Mobilization Agency,\" agency website, n.d., https://aodm.mnd.gov.tw/aodm-en/indexE.aspx. That agency has a useful but limited scope with its mandate of \"comprehensive management of 'planning for mobilization, management, service, civil defense, [and] building reserve capacity.' \"John Dotson, \"Taiwan's 'Military Force Restructuring Plan' and the Extension of Conscripted Military Service,\" Global Taiwan Institute's Global Taiwan Brief 8, no. 3 (2023), https://globaltaiwan.org/2023/02/taiwan-military-force-restructuring-plan-and-the-extension-of-conscripted-military-service/. But while defense is important (and further discussed below), as the Finnish and Swedish strategies underscore, Taiwan should expand its approach to resilience to include the full spectrum of governmental, private sector, and individual tasks -- and the necessary cooperative efforts to make them most effective.\n\nPresident Lai's recent election ushered in an unprecedented third consecutive term for the Democratic Progressive Party.The party does face, however, the governance challenges that come with a hung parliament. This outcome not only provides continuity in the agenda set by the island's duly elected leader, but also presents an opportunity to sharpen the focus areas for resilience. As Taiwan transitions to a Lai presidency, the challenge of shoring up the island's resilience should be at the forefront.\n\nAs a valuable starting point for establishing such an expanded resilience strategy, the Lai government should undertake extensive consultations with both Finland and Sweden -- which could be facilitated as necessary by the United States. Taiwan should also seek to engage with the Hybrid Center of Excellence, based in Finland, which is an \"autonomous, network-based international organization countering hybrid threats.\"Hybrid CoE,\" European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, n.d., https://www.hybridcoe.fi/.\n\nThe discussion below describes several important elements of a comprehensive resilience strategy, and it will be a crucial task for the Lai administration to expand Taiwan's current efforts to the full scope of such an approach. Resilience is a team game with the whole of society playing a role. But only Taiwan's central government can act as the team captain, setting expectations, establishing priorities, formulating and communicating national strategy, and coordinating activities. Only leaders in national-level government can oversee the critical work of developing institutional effectiveness in key areas of risk management and resilience.\n\nAs a starting point, Taiwan should undertake a comprehensive audit now to uncover any gaps in the country's ability to understand, respond to, and recover from both the chronic risks it currently faces and any more acute manifestations of PRC aggression in the future. Taiwan's government should examine the following areas to pursue greater resilience:\n\nWorking with countries that are already developing vanguard resilience capabilities could help Taiwan quickly establish a workable model. For example, the United Kingdom's National Situation CentreLucy Fisher, \"First Glimpse Inside UK's New White House-Style Crisis Situation Centre,\" Telegraph, December 14, 2021, https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/12/14/first-glimpse-inside-uks-new-white-house-style-crisis-situation/. -- built in less than a year during the COVID-19 pandemic -- is a model of developing access to critical data in peacetime and lessons learned from previous crisis scenarios about the practical challenges a nation could face in a variety of scenarios. Many commercial providers offer competent ways of displaying data insights on dashboards, and while this is helpful, it is only part of what can be achieved.\n\nAs a model for its broader resilience requirements, Taiwan will have the benefit of its existing efforts including in the counterdisinformation arena, where it has programs as effective as any in the world, despite the fact that Taiwan consistently faces the world's highest volume of targeted disinformation campaigns.A. Rauchfleisch et al., \"Taiwan's Public Discourse About Disinformation: The Role of Journalism, Academia, and Politics,\" Journalism Practice 17, no. 10 (2023): 2197-2217, https://doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2022.2110928. The saturation of PRC information manipulation across Taiwan's traditional and social media platforms is strategically designed to undermine social cohesion, erode trust in government institutions, and soften resistance to Beijing's forced unification agenda, while sowing doubts about America's commitment to peace and stability in the region.\n\nTaiwan has developed a multifaceted strategy to combat this onslaught, eschewing heavy-handed censorship in favor of promoting free speech and empowering civil society. This approach serves as a beacon for other democracies, demonstrating how to effectively counter disinformation through rapid-response mechanisms, independent fact-checking, along with widespread media literacy initiatives. Collaborative efforts such as the Taiwan FactCheck Center, Cofacts, and MyGoPen have proven instrumental in swiftly identifying and debunking false rumors, notably during the closely watched presidential election on January 13.Chee-Hann Wu, \"Three Musketeers against MIS/Disinformation: Assessing Citizen-Led Fact-Checking Practices in Taiwan,\" Taiwan Insight magazine, July 21, 2023, https://taiwaninsight.org/2023/03/31/three-musketeers-against-mis-disinformation-assessing-citizen-led-fact-checking-practices-in-taiwan/; and David Klepper and Huizhong Wu, \"How Taiwan Beat Back Disinformation and Preserved the Integrity of Its Election,\" Associated Press, January 29, 2024, https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-election-china-disinformation-vote-fraud-4968ef08fd13821e359b8e195b12919c.\n\nTaiwan's Minister of Digital Affairs (MoDA) attributes the island's success in combating this \"infodemic\" to its sophisticated civil-sector efforts, which avoids reliance on reactive takedowns of malicious content akin to a game of whack-a-mole. Much like its handling of the pandemic -- where Taiwan achieved one of the world's lowest COVID-19 fatality rates without resorting to draconian lockdowns -- it has demonstrated resilience and innovation in the digital sphere.E. Glen Weyl and Audrey Tang, \"The Life of a Digital Democracy,\" Plurality (open-source project on collaborative technology and democracy), accessed May 6, 2024, https://www.plurality.net/v/chapters/2-2/eng/?mode=dark.\n\nTaiwan's response to disinformation demonstrates that it is well-positioned to establish a comprehensive approach to societal resilience. The discussion below describes several important elements of a comprehensive resilience strategy, but it will be a crucial task for the Lai administration to expand Taiwan's current efforts to the full scope of such an approach.\n\nLike all advanced economies, Taiwan depends on its critical infrastructures. Critical infrastructures have been described as \"sectors whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital . . . that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety.\"\"Critical Infrastructure Sectors,\" US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), 2022, https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors. Since several critical infrastructures are interlinked, it is important in evaluating resilience to \"capture cross-cutting risks and associated dependencies that may have cascading impacts within and across sectors.\"\"National Critical Functions,\" CISA, n.d., https://www.cisa.gov/topics/risk-management/national-critical-functions. Among those interlinked critical infrastructures are energy, communications, transportation, and water. Each of these are critical to society as a whole and each are dependent on digital technology for their operations.\n\nIn Taiwan, the Administration for Cyber Security has identified critical infrastructures \"by their feature types into the following eight fields: energy, water resource, telecommunications, transportation, banking and finance, emergency aid and hospitals, central and local governments, and high-tech parks.\"Taiwan Administration for Cyber Security, \"Cyber Security Defense of Critical Infrastructure: Operations,\" Ministry of Digital Affairs, February 21, 2023, https://moda.gov.tw/en/ACS/operations/ciip/650. It is worth underscoring that several of Taiwan's critical infrastructures, such as the electric grid\"Taipower Announces Grid Resilience Strengthening Construction Plan with NT$564.5 Billion Investment Over 10 Years, Preventing Recurrence of Massive Power Outages,\" Ministry of Economic Affairs, September 15, 2022, https://www.moea.gov.tw/MNS/english/news/News.aspx?kind=6&menu_id=176&news_id=103225#:~:text=Wen%2DSheng%20Tseng%20explained%20that,of%20electricity%20demand%20in%20Taiwan. and the water system,Taiwan Water Corporation provides most of the water in Taiwan.

As described by Taiwan's Administration for Cyber Security, \"Due to Taiwan's unique political and economic situation, the country faces not only a complex global cyber security environment but also severe cyber security threats, making the continuous implementation and improvement of cyber security measures a necessity.\"\"About Us: History,\" Administration for Cyber Security, MoDA, n.d., https://moda.gov.tw/en/ACS/aboutus/history/608.

As described by the US International Trade Administration (ITA), \"Taiwan faces a disproportionately high number of cyberattacks, receiving as many as 30 million attacks per month in 2022.\" See \"Taiwan -- Country Commercial Guide,\" US ITA, last published January 10, 2024, https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/taiwan-cybersecurity.\n\nThe number of cyberattacks against Taiwan is notable.Statistics are not entirely consistent, and attempted intrusions are sometimes counted as attacks. Published estimates range from five million cyberattacks per day against Taiwanese government agencies\"Taiwanese Gov't Facing 5M Cyber Attacks per Day,\" CyberTalk, Check Point Software Technologies, accessed May 2, 2024, https://www.cybertalk.org/taiwanese-govt-facing-5m-cyber-attacks-per-day/. Other private-sector companies' analyses have reached comparable conclusions. to the detection of 15,000 cyberattacks per second, including attempted intrusions, in Taiwan during the first half of 2023.Huang Tzu-ti, \"Taiwan Hit by 15,000 Cyberattacks per Second in First Half of 2023,\" Taiwan News, August 17, 2023, https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/news/4973448.\n\nThe attacks often focus on key societal infrastructures. A recent Voice of America report noted that just prior to the January 2024 elections:\n\nGoogle researchers have likewise described the cyber threat to key critical infrastructures, revealing that it is \"tracking close to 100 hacking groups out of China [and that these] malicious groups are attacking a wide spectrum of organizations, including the government, private industry players and defense organizations.\"Gagandeep Kaur, \"Is China Waging a Cyber War with Taiwan?,\" CSO Online, December 1, 2023, https://www.csoonline.com/article/1250513/is-china-waging-a-cyber-war-with-taiwan.html#:~:text=Nation%2Dstate%20hacking%20groups%20based.\n\nThe attacks themselves are often relatively sophisticated. Trellix, a cybersecurity firm, described multiple techniques utilized by attackers that \"focused on defense evasion, discovery, and command and control . . . to subvert system defenses to gather information about accounts, systems, and networks.\" Among them are \"living-off-the-land\" techniques, which allow attackers to maintain their intrusions over time with smaller chances of detection.Anne A wrote that \"attackers are likely to employ living off-the-land techniques to gather policing, banking, and political information to achieve their goals. They also likely simultaneously and stealthily evaded security detections from remote endpoints.\"See An, \"Cyberattack on Democracy: Escalating Cyber Threats Immediately Ahead of Taiwan's 2024 Presidential Election,\" Trellix, February 13, 2024, https://www.trellix.com/blogs/research/cyberattack-on-democracy-escalating-cyber-threats-immediately-ahead-of-taiwan-2024-presidential-election/. Separately, a Microsoft Threat Intelligence blog said: \"Microsoft has identified a nation-state activity group tracked as Flax Typhoon, based in China, that is targeting dozens of organizations in Taiwan with the likely intention of performing espionage. Flax Typhoon gains and maintains long-term access to Taiwanese organizations' networks with minimal use of malware, relying on tools built into the operating system, along with some normally benign software to quietly remain in these networks.\" See \"Flax Typhoon Using Legitimate Software to Quietly Access Taiwanese Organizations,\" Microsoft Threat Intelligence blog, August 24, 2023, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/08/24/flax-typhoon-using-legitimate-software-to-quietly-access-taiwanese-organizations/.\n\nWhile no one can say with certainty what actions the PRC would take in the context of a blockade of or outright conflict with Taiwan, the United States is clear-eyed about the potential for attacks on its own critical infrastructures if engaged in conflict with China. The February 2023 Annual Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community notes the likelihood of such PRC cyberattacks in that context:\n\nThe ongoing Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine war further underscore the reality of critical infrastructures as a target in a conflict. It seems reasonable to assume that comparable actions (and perhaps even more) would be undertaken against Taiwan in the event of a blockade or kinetic conflict. \"Probable targets,\" according to James A. Lewis, would include critical infrastructures such as electrical power facilities, information and communications systems, and pipelines.James Lewis, \"Cyberattack on Civilian Critical Infrastructures in a Taiwan Scenario,\" Center for Strategic and International Studies, August 2023, https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2023-08/230811_Lewis_Cyberattack_Taiwan.pdf?VersionId=l.gf7ysPjoW3.OcHvcRuNcpq3gN.Vj8b.\n\nTaiwan can enhance its cyber resilience through its own actions and in collaborative activities with private-sector companies and with the United States. While cyberattacks can be highly disruptive, one of the important lessons of the Ukraine-Russia conflict is that the effects on operations can be mitigated, as described in a CyberScoop analysis that underscores a shift in expectations:\n\nAccording to the analysis, the critical element for such success has been significant multinational and public-private collaboration:\n\nTaiwan should utilize the Ukraine model of cyber resilience -- backed in part by private-sector companies -- and take comparable actions to enhance its cybersecurity. Taiwan has a substantial existing cybersecurity framework on which to build such mitigating actions. Since 2022, the Ministry of Digital Affairs, through its Administration for Cyber Security, is responsible for \"implementing cyber security management and defense mechanisms for national critical infrastructures\" including \"evaluating and auditing cyber security works at government agencies and public entities.\"\"About Us: History,\" Administration for Cyber Security. Utilizing that framework, Taiwan should undertake the following four actions that would significantly enhance the island's cybersecurity resilience.\n\nFirst, Taiwan should utilize cloud-based capabilities to establish a duplicative set of cyber-enabled governmental functions outside of Taiwan. Ukraine undertook such actions, thereby rendering Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine unable to disrupt ongoing governmental activities. Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs has been evaluating the use of public clouds including the possibility of \"digital embassies\" abroad to hold data.Si Ying Thian, \"'Turning Conflicts into Co-creation': Taiwan Government Harnesses Digital Policy for Democracy,\" GovInsider, December 6, 2023, https://govinsider.asia/intl-en/article/turning-conflicts-into-co-creation-taiwans-digital-ministry-moda-harnesses-digital-policy-for-democracy. Taiwan should organize such actions with key cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, which provided support to Ukraine.Frank Konkel, \"How a Push to the Cloud Helped a Ukrainian Bank Keep Faith with Customers amid War,\" NextGov/FCW, November 30, 2023, https://www.nextgov.com/modernization/2023/11/how-push-cloud-helped-ukrainian-bank-keep-faith-customers-amid-war/392375/. The United States should work with Taiwan and appropriate cloud providers to help effectuate such a result.\n\nSecond, Taiwan should establish arrangements with private-sector cybersecurity providers to undertake defensive operations against PRC cyberattacks in the context of a blockade or kinetic conflict. As noted above, such private-sector actions have been instrumental to Ukraine, and would similarly be invaluable for Taiwan. The United States should also help facilitate such private-sector defensive cyber operations for Taiwan.\n\nThird, Taiwan should organize a surge capability of individual cybersecurity experts who can be called upon to complement governmental resources. Both Estonia and the United Kingdom have very effective cyber-reserve approaches, and Taiwan should engage with each country, seeking lessons learned as part of establishing its own reserve corps.\n\nFourth, Taiwan needs to accelerate its low-earth orbit satellite communications program. The Ministry of Digital Affairs' two-year, US$18 million plan to strengthen the resilience of government communications entails building more than 700 satellite receiver stations. The impetus: ships from mainland China have repeatedly severed submarine internet cables in what Taiwan perceived as \"a trial of methods\" that the PRC could use to prepare for a military invasion.Eric Priezkalns, \"Taiwan to Build 700 Satellite Receivers as Defense against China Cutting Submarine Cables,\" CommsRisk, June 13, 2023, https://commsrisk.com/taiwan-to-build-700-satellite-receivers-as-defense-against-china-cutting-submarine-cables/.\n\nThe existing program involves satellites as well as ground-based receivers. The Taiwan Space Agency disclosed its plan for a \"dedicated\" LEO satellite communications project in late 2022,Juliana Suess, \"Starlink 2.0? Taiwan's Plan for a Sovereign Satellite Communications System,\" Commentary, Royal United Services Institute, January 20, 2023, https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/starlink-20-taiwans-plan-sovereign-satellite-communications-system. as a public-private partnership:\n\nIn accord with the Taiwan Relations Act,Taiwan Relations Act, US Pub. L. No. 96-8, 93 Stat. 14 (1979), https://www.congress.gov/96/statute/STATUTE-93/STATUTE-93-Pg14.pdf. and as a matter of long-standing policy, the United States strongly supports Taiwan's defensive capabilities including for cybersecurity. The Integrated Country Strategy of the American Institute in Taiwan (essentially the unofficial US embassy) specifically provides that \"bolster[ing] Taiwan's cybersecurity resilience\" is one of the United States' strategic priorities for the island.\"Integrated Country Strategy,\" American Institute in Taiwan, 2022, https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ICS_EAP_Taiwan_Public.pdf. To support that objective, the United States can enhance Taiwan cybersecurity through cooperative defensive activities.\n\nFirst, US Cyber Command regularly supports the network resilience of allied countries and partners through its \"Hunt Forward\" operations, which are \"strictly defensive\" joint ventures, undertaken following an invitation from the ally or partner, to \"observe and detect malicious cyber activity\" on these networks, together searching out \"vulnerabilities, malware, and adversary presence.\"Franklin D. Kramer, The Sixth Domain: The Role of the Private Sector in Warfare, Atlantic Council, October 16, 2023, 13, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-sixth-domain-The-role-of-the-private-sector-in-warfare-Oct16.pdf.\n\nWhile Taiwan has not been specifically identified as a Hunt Forward participant, Anne Neuberger, who is the US deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, said at a Politico Tech Summit in 2023 that in the event of a major cyberattack on Taiwan, the United States would \"send its best teams to help hunt down the attackers, the same approach typically used to help global allies in cyberspace.\"Joseph Gedeon, \"Taiwan Is Bracing for Chinese Cyberattacks, White House Official Says,\" Politico, September 27, 2023, https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/27/taiwan-chinese-cyberattacks-white-house-00118492. She described the typical approach as:\n\nNeuberger also highlighted US work with Taiwan to carry out military tabletop games and exercises to prepare for potential cyberattack.Gedeon, \"Taiwan Is Bracing.\"\n\nMore recently, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2024 explicitly authorized the Defense Department to cooperate on:\n\nGoing forward, those authorities authorize not only Hunt Forward actions but also actions to leverage commercial and military technology to harden such networks (which would seem to resolve any export control issues) and to conduct combined training and exercises, all of which underscores clear congressional approval for enhanced cybersecurity activities with Taiwan.National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024.\n\nSecond, the United States should undertake to enhance Taiwan's communications resilience by making available access to US commercial and military LEO networks. The important role of the commercial provider Starlink in assuring communications in the context of the Ukraine-Russia war is well-known.According to a report by Emma Schroeder and Sean Dack, \"Starlink's performance in the Ukraine conflict demonstrated its high value for wartime satellite communications: Starlink, a network of low-orbit satellites working in constellations operated by SpaceX, relies on satellite receivers no larger than a backpack that are easily installed and transported. Because Russian targeting of cellular towers made communications coverage unreliable . . . the government 'made a decision to use satellite communication for such emergencies' from American companies like SpaceX. Starlink has proven more resilient than any other alternatives throughout the war. Due to the low orbit of Starlink satellites, they can broadcast to their receivers at relatively higher power than satellites in higher orbits. There has been little reporting on successful Russian efforts to jam Starlink transmissions.\" See Schroeder and Dack, A Parallel Terrain: Public-Private Defense of the Ukrainian Information Environment, Atlantic Council, February 2023, 14, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/A-Parallel-Terrain.pdf. Starlink's parent company, SpaceX, is, however, controlled by Elon Musk, whose Tesla company has major investments in China. That linkage has raised the question of whether Taiwan could rely on any commercial arrangements it might make on its own with Starlink -- particularly since Starlink did impose some limitations on Ukraine's use of the network.Joey Roulette, \"SpaceX Curbed Ukraine's Use of Starlink Internet for Drones: Company President,\" Reuters, February 9, 2023, https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/spacex-curbed-ukraines-use-starlink-internet-drones-company-president-2023-02-09/. However, as previously described by one of the authors of this report, the US government has sway on such matters:\n\nAccordingly, the US should rely on this authority to organize appropriate arrangements with Starlink -- and other space companies that provide like capabilities -- to ensure access that would support Taiwan communications. One way to do this would be to incorporate appropriate terms into the commercial augmentation space reserve (CASR) program arrangements that US Space Force is currently negotiating with civil space providers,Frank Kramer, Ann Dailey, and Joslyn Brodfuehrer, NATO Multidomain Operations: Near- and Medium-term Priority Initiatives, Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, Atlantic Council, March 2024, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NATO-multidomain-operations-Near-and-medium-term-priority-initiatives.pdf. as part of the Department of Defense's overall commercial space strategy.Department of Defense, \"Commercial Space Integration Strategy,\" 2024, https://media.defense.gov/2024/Apr/02/2003427610/-1/-1/1/2024-DOD-COMMERCIAL-SPACE-INTEGRATION-STRATEGY.PDF; and \"U.S. Space Force Commercial Space Strategy,\" US Space Force, April 8, 2024, https://www.spaceforce.mil//Portals/2/Documents/Space%20Policy/USSF_Commercial_Space_Strategy.pdf.\n\nAdditionally, the DOD is developing its own LEO capability through a variety of constellations being put in place by Space Force.\"Space Development Agency Successfully Launches Tranche 0 Satellites,\" Space Development Agency, September 2, 2023, https://www.sda.mil/space-development-agency-completes-second-successful-launch-of-tranche-0-satellites/. Pursuant to the recent NDAA authorization noted above, DOD should work with the Taiwan military to ensure that those constellations will be available to support Taiwan as necessary.\n\nLonger term, the United States should also undertake to enhance the resilience of Taiwan's undersea cables. As previously proposed by one of the authors, the United States should lead in establishing an international undersea infrastructure protection corps. It should:\n\nSuch an activity would include focus on cybersecurity for undersea cable networks, hardening and other protection for cable landing points, and capabilities and resources to ensure expeditious repair of cables as needed.Kramer, The Sixth Domain. To be sure, getting such an activity up and running will necessarily be a multiyear effort. However, Taiwan's vulnerability underscores the importance of beginning promptly and working as expeditiously as possible.\n\nAs part of its efforts to enhance resilience, Taiwan must mitigate its energy vulnerabilities, as its reliance on maritime imports for about 97 percent\"E-Stat,\" Energy Statistics Monthly Report, Energy Administration, Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs, accessed May 6, 2024, https://www.esist.org.tw/newest/monthly?tab=%E7%B6%9C%E5%90%88%E8%83%BD%E6%BA%90. of its energy needs creates acute risks. To lessen its dependency on maritime imports and strengthen its resiliency in the face of potential PRC coercion, Taiwan should curb energy and electricity demand, bolster indigenous supply, overhaul its inventory management, and prepare rationing plans. A resilient energy security approach would credibly signal to the PRC that Taiwan could hold out for long durations without maritime resupply.\n\nTaiwan's ultra-low electricity prices are a security risk (and a black eye for its climate targets). Reliance on seaborne energy shipments presents straightforward security problems, and Taiwan's low electricity prices subsidize consumption that is being met by imports of hydrocarbons, especially coal. The new Lai administration should make haste prudently, increasing electricity prices more frequently and significantly, without exceeding the limits of the politically possible.\n\nTaiwan's electricity price quandary is illustrated by Taipower, the state-owned monopoly utility. In 2022 and 2023, Taipower lost 227.2 billion New Taiwan dollars (NTD) and 198.5 billion NTD, respectively, as its per kilowatt hour cost of electricity sold substantially exceeded per unit prices.\"Comparison of Electricity Prices and Unit Cost Structures,\" Electricity Price Cost, Business Information, Information Disclosure, Taiwan Electric Power Co., accessed May 6, 2024, https://www.taipower.com.tw/tc/page.aspx?mid=196. Taipower's prices failed to offset the steep rise in electricity input costs amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the post-COVID-19 unsnarling of supply chains.\n\nTaiwan's electricity costs remain too low, diminishing the island's resiliency, although policymakers have now taken some steps in light of the problem. The Ministry of Economic Affairs' latest electricity price review, in March 2024, raised average prices by about 11 percent, with the new tariff reaching about 3.4518 NTD, or approximately $0.11 USD/kWh.Ministry of Economic Affairs (\u7d93\u6fdf\u90e8\u80fd\u6e90\u7f72), \"The Electricity Price Review Meeting,\" Headquarters News, accessed May 6, 2024, https://www.moea.gov.tw/MNS/populace/news/News.aspx?kind=1&menu_id=40&news_id=114222. This rationalization of prices, while welcome, is insufficient. In the United States, the rolling twelve-month ending price in January 2024 for all sectors totaled $0.127/kWh.\"Electric Power Monthly,\" US Energy Information Administration (EIA), February 2024, https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=table_5_03. Taiwan's heavily subsidized electricity consumers therefore enjoy a discount in excess of 13 percent compared to their US counterparts, despite US access to low-cost, abundant, and indigenously produced energy.\n\nTaiwan's heavily subsidized electricity prices incentivize maritime imports, especially coal. Astonishingly, Taiwan was the world's largest per capita user of coal generation for electricity in 2022, higher than even Australia, a major coal exporter.\n\nTaiwan's low electricity prices and use of coal expose the island to PRC economic coercion. Taiwan's dependency on imported coal heightens its vulnerability in the summer, when the island's electricity-generation needs peak. Concerningly, Taiwan has already experienced electricity shortfalls in summer peacetime conditions, including a wave of outagesLauly Li and Cheng Ting-Feng, \"Taiwan's Frequent Blackouts Expose Vulnerability of Tech Economy,\" Nikkei Asia, August 30, 2022, https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Taiwan-s-frequent-blackouts-expose-vulnerability-of-tech-economy. between July and August 2022. With the island's future summer cooling needs set to rise even further due to climate change and hotter temperatures, Taiwan's electricity needs pose a vulnerability that the PRC may attempt to exploit.\n\nCurbing Taiwan's electricity demand during summer months is critical, necessitating a rise in prices. While this reduction is a principal energy security challenge, the island must also do more to secure supply, especially for nuclear energy.\n\nTaiwan's resiliency will be strengthened by producing as much indigenous energy as possible, especially during the critical summer months. Taiwan, which has virtually no hydrocarbon resources, can therefore indigenously produce only four different forms of energy at scale: nuclear energy, offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar. Taiwan should pursue each of these indigenous energy sources. Taiwan should apply \"carrots\" by strengthening incentives and payments for indigenous production. At the same time, applying the \"stick\" of higher prices to energy consumption, especially for energy imports, would bolster the island's resiliency.\n\nTaiwan's renewable resources are significant and often economically viable, but they cannot secure adequate levels of resiliency by themselves. Taiwan's wind speeds slow in the summer,Xi Deng et al., \"Offshore Wind Power in China: A Potential Solution to Electricity Transformation and Carbon Neutrality,\" Fundamental Research, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fmre.2022.11.008. limiting onshore and offshore wind's effectiveness in bolstering energy security. Additionally, Taiwan's stringent localization requirements for offshore appropriately minimize PRC components and sensors in Taiwan's offshore wind turbines, but also raise the costs of this technology. Taiwan's solar potential\"Global Solar Atlas,\" World Bank Group, ESMAP, and Solar GIS, 2024, CC BY 4.0, https://globalsolaratlas.info/map?c=24.176825. is also limitedJulian Spector, \"Taiwan's Rapid Renewables Push Has Created a Bustling Battery Market,\" Canary Media, April 6, 2023, https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/taiwans-rapid-renewables-push-has-created-a-bustling-battery-market. by cloudy skies, frequent rainfall, and land scarcity.\n\nAccordingly, nuclear energy is the most viable way for Taiwan to address its summer electricity needs without turning to maritime imports. While Taiwan's nuclear reactors must acquire fuel from abroad, this fuel can be used for approximately eighteen to twenty-four months.\"U.S. Nuclear Plant Outages Increased in September After Remaining Low during Summer,\" Today in Energy, US EIA, October 18, 2015, https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37252#:~:text=Nuclear%20power%20plants%20typically%20refuel. Taiwan should maintain its existing nuclear energy capacity; restart retired capacity as soon as politically and technically feasible; and seek new, incremental capacity over time.For a more detailed discussion of Taiwan's indigenous supply, see Joseph Webster, \"Does Taiwan's Massive Reliance on Energy Imports Put Its Security at Risk?,\" New Atlanticist, Atlantic Council blog, July 7, 2023, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/does-taiwans-massive-reliance-on-energy-imports-put-its-security-at-risk/.\n\nTo cope with various contingencies, including the possibility of a prolonged summertime blockade, Taiwan should increase its stockpiles of energy, disperse inventory around the island, and harden facilities.\n\nWhile Taiwan's ability to hold out against a blockade involves by many factors, energy inventories are a critical element. Taiwan's electricity reserves are limited: it reported fifty-six days of supply of coal inventories in February 2023,\"The Current Situation and Future of [the] Country's Energy Supply and Reserves (\u7acb\u6cd5\u9662),\" Seventh Session of the Tenth Legislative Yuan, Sixth Plenary Meeting of the Economic Committee, accessed May 7, 2024, https://ppg.ly.gov.tw/ppg/SittingAttachment/download/2023030989/02291301002301567002.pdf. and aims to raise its natural gas inventories from eleven days to more than twenty days by 2030.Jeanny Kao and Yimou Lee, \"Taiwan to Boost Energy Inventories amid China Threat,\" ed. Gerry Doyle, Reuters, October 23, 2022, https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/taiwan-boost-energy-inventories-amid-china-threat-2022-10-24/. These inventory levels should be expanded, in part because \"days of supply\" fail to encapsulate uncertainty. Demand fluctuates depending on temperature and other variables, while Taiwan's access to energy storage inventories faces the risk of sabotage and, in certain scenarios, kinetic strikes.\n\nTaiwan's management of petroleum reserves is a matter of great importance, given the use of these fuels, especially diesel, for military matters. Taiwan's Energy Administration, in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, reported in April 2024 that its total oil inventories stood at 167 days of supply.Energy Administration, \"Domestic Oil Reserves Monthly Data (\u570b\u5167\u77f3\u6cb9\u5b89\u5168\u5b58\u91cf\u6708\u8cc7\u6599),\" Ministry of Economic Affairs, accessed May 6, 2024, https://www.moeaea.gov.tw/ecw/populace/content/wfrmStatistics.aspx?type=4&menu_id=1302. This topline figure presents an overly optimistic portrait of Taiwan's petroleum security, however. For instance, Taiwan's government-controlled inventories in April 2024Energy Administration, Ministry of Economic Affairs. included 2.6 million kiloliters of crude oil and refined products; private stocks added another 6.5 million kiloliters. Accordingly, Taiwan reports forty-seven days of supply from government stockpiles, with an additional 120 days from private inventories.Energy Administration, Ministry of Economic Affairs. Given that domestic sales and consumption equated to about 54,200 kiloliters per day from prior comparable periods,Energy Administration, Ministry of Economic Affairs. Taiwan calculated it had about 167 days of supply.\n\nThere may, however, be insufficient monitoring of private inventories. Marek Jestrab observed:\n\nWhile Taiwan should ensure that stockpiles are actually on the island, and not at sea, it also needs to carefully examine the inventory split between crude oil and crude products, such as diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, etc. Additionally, Taiwan's policymakers should not expect to rely on its crude inventories, which only have a latent potential: crude oil cannot be used until it is refined into a crude product. Therefore, if the PRC disrupted Taiwan's refineries via cyber or even kinetic means, Taiwan would not be able to access the totality of its crude oil reserves.\n\nTaiwan's military requirements for fuel would likely surge during a confrontation or conflict with the PRC, reducing the \"days of supply.\" Since Taiwan's military vehicles largely run on diesel, the island should pay careful attention to this product.\n\nTaiwan should disperse and harden its energy assets, especially diesel storage, as concentrated objects would present inviting targets for the PRC. Beijing is studying Russia's invasion of Ukraine closely and will not fail to notice that Moscow attacked about 30 percent of Ukrainian infrastructure in a single day.Kathleen Magramo et al., \"October 11, 2022 Russia-Ukraine News,\" CNN, October 11, 2022, https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-10-11-22/index.html. As one author witnessed during his recent visit to Kyiv, Ukraine's dispersal of electricity assets is achieving a reasonable degree of success. Indeed, Russia's more recent campaignTom Balforth, \"Major Russian Air Strikes Destroy Kyiv Power Plant, Damage Other Stations,\" Reuters, November 2024, https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-missile-strike-targets-cities-across-ukraine-2024-04-11/#:~:text=KYIV%2C%20April%2011%20(Reuters),runs%20low%20on%20air%20defences. attacking large-scale thermal and hydroelectric power plants illustrates the utility of dispersed energy infrastructure. Like Ukraine, Taiwan should disperse and harden its energy storage inventories to the maximal feasible extent.\n\nWhile both Taiwan's electricity supply and demand will be very hard to predict in a state of emergency, rationing plans must be considered -- especially for the island's manufacturing and semiconductor industries.\n\nTaiwan's economy is uniquelyGlobal Taiwan Institute, \"Taiwan's Electrical Grid and the Need for Greater System Resilience,\" June 14, 2023, https://globaltaiwan.org/2023/06/taiwans-electrical-grid-and-the-need-for-greater-system-resilience/. tied to electricity-intensive manufacturing, as industrial consumers accounted for more than 55 percent of Taiwan's electricity consumption in 2023.\"3-04 Electricity Consumption (3-04 \u96fb\u529b\u6d88\u8cbb),\" Taiwan Energy Statistics Monthly Report (\u80fd\u6e90\u7d71\u8a08\u6708\u5831), accessed May 6, 2024, https://www.esist.org.tw/newest/monthly?tab=%E9%9B%BB%E5%8A%9B. Most of these industrial producers (such as chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) service export markets -- not Taiwan. While the PRC might attempt to disrupt the island's energy and electricity supply via cyber and kinetic means, Taiwan's electricity consumption would fall dramatically during a crisis if Taiwan's industries were forced to shut down. Although the closure of Taiwan's industry would prove economically ruinous, it would also make the island's electricity and energy issues much more manageable. Adding an additional layer of complication, many of Taiwan's most valuable exports - such as chips - are shipped via civilian airliners, not on seaborne vessels, and would consequently be more difficult to interdict in circumstances short of war.Alperovitch, D. (2024, June 6). A Chinese economic blockade of Taiwan would fail or launch a war. War on the Rocks. https://warontherocks.com/2024/06/a-chinese-economic-blockade-of-taiwan-would-fail-or-launch-a-war/ Taiwan should prepare rationing plans for a variety of contingencies, adapting to a range of scenarios, including a quarantine, siege, or even kinetic conflict. Taiwan must be ready.\n\nEver since Beijing leveraged then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi's August 2022 visit to Taiwan as an excuse to launch large-scale joint blockade military exercises, pundits have labeled the residual military situation around Taiwan as a \"new normal.\" Yet there is really nothing normal about a permanent presence of People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy warships menacingly surrounding the island along its twenty-four nautical mile contiguous zone, and nothing usual about increasing numbers of manned and unmanned military aircraft crossing the tacit median line in the Taiwan Strait -- a line that held significance for seven decades as a symbol of cross-strait stability. Nor should it be viewed as normal that a steady stream of high-altitude surveillance balloons -- which are suspected of collecting military intelligence -- violate Taiwan's airspace.\"The Ministry of National Defense Issues a Press Release Explaining Reports That 'Airborne Balloons by the CCP Had Continuously Flown over Taiwan,' \" Taiwan Ministry of National Defense, January 6, 2024, https://www.mnd.gov.tw/english/Publish.aspx?title=News%20Channel&SelectStyle=Defense%20News%20&p=82479. Some have better described this \"new normal\" as a strategy akin to an anaconda noticeably tightening its grip around the island, drawing close enough to reduce warning time and provocative enough to raise the risk of inadvertent clashes. In other words, the PRC has unilaterally dialed up a military cost-imposition campaign meant to chip away at peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, wear down Taiwan's military, and erode confidence and social cohesion in Taiwan society.\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was an additional wake-up call for the citizens of Taiwan, following mainland China's 2019 crackdown on Hong Kong freedoms, heightening recognition of the risks presented by the PRC and, in particular, that the long-standing status quo in cross-strait relations is no longer acceptable to Beijing. Taiwan thus finds itself in the unenviable position of simultaneously countering PLA gray zone intrusions and cognitive warfare -- what NATO calls affecting attitudes and behaviors to gain advantage\"Cognitive Warfare,\" Allied Command Transformation, NATO, accessed May 24, 2024, https://www.act.nato.int/activities/cognitive-warfare/#:~:text=NORFOLK%2C%20VA%20%E2%80%93%20Cognitive%20Warfare%20includes,an%20advantage%20over%20an%20adversary. -- while beefing itself up militarily to deter the growing threat of a blockade or assault.\n\nWith this backdrop, Taipei authorities have since embarked on long-overdue reforms in defense affairs, marked by several developments aimed at bolstering the island democracy's military capabilities and readiness in the face of growing threats from Beijing.\n\nFirst, Taiwan's overall defense spending has undergone seven consecutive year-on-year increases, reaching 2.5 percent of gross domestic product.\"Taiwan Announces an Increased Defense Budget for 2024,\" Global Taiwan Institute, September 20, 2023, https://globaltaiwan.org/2023/09/taiwan-announces-an-increased-defense-budget-for-2024/. While this is commendable, Taiwan's defense requirements are very substantial, and its budget in US dollars is only $19.1 billion.Yu Nakamura, \"Taiwan Allots Record Defense Budget for 2024 to Meet China Threat,\" Nikkei Asia, August 24, 2023, https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Defense/Taiwan-allots-record-defense-budget-for-2024-to-meet-China-threat. Accordingly, it will be important for Taiwan to continue the trend of higher defense spending to at least 3 percent of GDP both to bolster Taiwan's military capabilities and as a deterrent signal to Beijing -- and also to garner international community recognition that Taiwan is serious about its own defense. A key element will be to ensure that Taiwan has sufficient stocks of ammunition and other weapons capabilities to fight effectively until the United States could fully engage and in the event of a longer war. One area that deserves a high degree of attention is defense against ballistic and cruise missiles and unmanned vehicles. Especially in light of the recent coalition success in defeating such Iranian attacks against Israel, planning should be undertaken to assure comparable success for Taiwan against PRC attacks. Adding mobile, short-range air defenses to the high-priority list of military investments for Taiwan -- such as the highly mobile National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS)\"NASAMS: National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System,\" Raytheon, accessed May 12, 2024, https://www.rtx.com/raytheon/what-we-do/integrated-air-and-missile-defense/nasams. -- will make it harder for the PLA to find and destroy Taiwan defenses, especially if combined with passive means for target detection and missile guidance.\n\nSecond, the new president can kick-start an enhanced approach to defense by embracing full integration of public-private innovation and adopting Ukraine's model of grass-roots innovation for defense, which has served it well through a decade of war against a much larger Russia. Recognizing that innovation is itself a form of resilience, Taiwan can draw valuable lessons from Ukraine, particularly in leveraging private-sector expertise. By implementing what some Ukrainian defense experts term a \"capability accelerator\" to integrate emerging technologies into mission-focused capabilities, Taiwan can enhance its resilience and swiftly adapt to evolving security challenges, including rapidly fielding a high volume of unmanned systems to achieve distributed surveillance, redundant command and control, and higher survivability.Lopatin, \"Bind Ukraine's Military-Technology Revolution.\" This comprehensive approach, which recognizes the private sector as the greatest source of innovation in today's complex security environment, holds significant potential for enhancing Taiwan's defense capabilities through the utilization of disruptive technologies. The island's overall resilience would significantly benefit by drawing the private sector in as a direct stakeholder in national defense matters.\n\nUkraine's grass-roots model of defense innovation, spearheaded by volunteers, nongovernment organizations, and international partners, is a worthy and timely model for Taiwan. Ukraine's approach has yielded significant advancements in drone warfare, as well as sophisticated capabilities like the Delta battlefield management system -- a user-friendly cloud-based situational awareness tool that provides real-time information on enemy and friendly forces through the integration of data from sources such as drones, satellites, and even civilian reports.Grace Jones, Janet Egan, and Eric Rosenbach, \"Advancing in Adversity: Ukraine's Battlefield Technologies and Lessons for the U.S.,\" Policy Brief, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School, July 31, 2023, https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/advancing-adversity-ukraines-battlefield-technologies-and-lessons-us. This collaborative model, reliant on cooperation between civilian developers and military end users, has propelled Ukraine's military technological revolution by integrating intelligence and surveillance tasks, while enhancing decision-making and kill-chain target acquisition. Taiwan will benefit from a comparable approach.\n\nThird, as suggested above, Taiwan should focus a large portion of its defense budget on low-cost, highly effective systems. In terms of force structure, it appears that Taiwan has settled on a design that blends large legacy platforms of a twentieth-century military with the introduction of more survivable and distributable low-end asymmetric capabilities. The latter are best exemplified by Taiwan's indigenously produced Ta Chiang-class of high-speed, guided-missile corvettes (PGG) and Min Jiang-class fast mine laying boats (FMLB).For more information, see, e.g., Peter Suciu, \"Future of Taiwan's Navy: Inside the Tuo Chiang-Class Missile Corvettes,\" National Interest, March 27, 2024, https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/future-taiwans-navy-inside-tuo-chiang-class-missile-corvettes-210269; and Xavier Vavasseur, \"Taiwan Launches 1st Mine Laying Ship for ROC Navy,\" Naval News, August 5, 2020, https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2020/08/taiwan-launches-1st-mine-laying-ship-for-roc-navy/. But much more must be done to bolster Taiwan's overall defense capabilities by focusing on less expensive, but nonetheless highly effective systems.\n\nIn Ukraine's battle against Russian Federation invaders, drones have provided Ukrainian forces with important tactical capabilities by enabling them to gather intelligence, monitor enemy movements, and conduct precision strikes on high-value targets. Taiwan can comparably utilize low-cost UAVs to establish mesh networks that connect devices for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and for targeting that would be invaluable in countering a PRC amphibious assault. Lessons from Ukraine further highlight the importance of having the right mix of drone types and capabilities in substantial stockpiles, capable of a variety of missions. Notably, Ukrainian officials have called for the production of more than one million domestically produced drones in 2024.Mykola Bielieskov, \"Outgunned Ukraine Bets on Drones as Russian Invasion Enters Third Year,\" Ukraine Alert, Atlantic Council blog, February 20, 2024, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/outgunned-ukraine-bets-on-drones-as-russian-invasion-enters-third-year/. Then-President Tsai's formation of a civilian-led \"drone national team\" program is a commendable step in this direction and underscores the power of collaborative innovation in joint efforts between users.Yimou Lee, James Pomfret, and David Lague, \"Inspired by Ukraine War, Taiwan Launches Drone Blitz to Counter China,\" Reuters, July 21, 2023, https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/us-china-tech-taiwan/. Encouraging cooperation between Taiwan drone makers and US private industry will accelerate the development of a combat-ready unmanned systems fleet with sufficient range, endurance, and payload to enhance situational awareness and battlefield effects.\n\nConcurrent with those efforts utilizing unmanned systems, Taiwan should bolster its naval mining capabilities as a strategic measure against PRC aggression. Naval mines represent one of the most cost-effective and immediately impactful layers of defense.Franklin D. Kramer and Lt. Col. Matthew R. Crouch, Transformative Priorities for National Defense, Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, Atlantic Council, 2021, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Transformative-Priorities-Report-2021.pdf. In this regard, Taiwan's new Min Jiang class of FMLB represents the right type of investments in capabilities which could prove pivotal in thwarting potential invasion attempts.\n\nEven more significantly for a Taiwan audience, Ukraine broke a blockade of its Black Sea ports using a combination of naval drones and coastal defense missiles -- and repelled the once-mighty Russian Black Sea Fleet -- all without a traditional navy of its own.Peter Dickinson, \"Ukraine's Black Sea Success Exposes Folly of West's 'Don't Escalate' Mantra,\" Ukraine Alert, Atlantic Council, January 22, 2024, https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/ukraines-black-sea-success-provides-a-blueprint-for-victory-over-putin/. Faced with clear intent by a PLA Navy practicing daily to isolate the island, the time is past due for Taiwanese authorities to hone their own counterblockade skills including a heavy reliance on unmanned surface vehicles.\n\nTaiwan should also make rapid investments in port infrastructure and defenses along Taiwan's eastern seaboard in places such as Su'ao and Hualien harbors, which can serve as deepwater ports that are accessible, strategic, antiblockade strongpoints, and where any conceivable PLA blockade would be at its weakest and most vulnerable point logistically. Su'ao harbor, as a potential future homeport for Taiwan's new indigenous Hai Kun-class diesel submarines, could also serve a dual purpose as an experimentation and development zone for public-private collaboration on unmanned-systems employment and operations. Infrastructure investments in East Coast ports could enhance the island's ability to attain emergency resupply of energy, food, humanitarian supplies, and munitions under all conditions, broadening options for international community aid and complicating PLA efforts.\n\nFourth, every new capability needs trained operators who are empowered to employ and engage. This year Taiwan began implementation of a new, one-year conscript training system for male adults born after January 1, 2005 (up from a wholly inadequate four months of conscription in the past decade).Ministry of National Defense, ROC National Security Defense Report 2023, https://www.mnd.gov.tw/newupload/ndr/112/112ndreng.pdf. Taiwan's \"all-out defense\" plan realigns into a frontline main battle force consisting of all-volunteer career military personnel, backed up by a standing garrison force composed mainly of conscripted military personnel guarding infrastructure, along with a civil defense system integrated with local governments and private-sector resources. Upon mobilization, there would also be a reserve force to supplement the main battle and garrison forces.\n\nAccording to details laid out in its 2023 National Defense Report, Taiwan's revamped one-year conscript system and reorganized reserve mobilization system place significant emphasis on traditional military combat skills, such as rifle marksmanship and operation of mortars.Ministry of National Defense, ROC National Security Defense Report 2023. However, in response to evolving security challenges and the changing nature of warfare, Taiwan's military should incorporate greater training in emerging technologies and unconventional tactics, along with decentralized command and control, especially in the areas of drone warfare, where unmanned aerial vehicles and surface vessels play a crucial role in reconnaissance, surveillance, and targeted strikes. By integrating drone warfare training into the conscript system as well as in annual reserve call-up training, Taiwan can better prepare its military personnel to adapt to modern battlefield environments and effectively counter emerging threats.\n\nIntegrating drone operations into military operations down to the conscript and reservist level offers a cost-effective means to enhance battlefield situational awareness and operational capabilities, and also has the added benefit of enhancing the attractiveness and value of a mandatory conscription system emerging from years of low morale and characterized by Taiwan's outgoing president as \"insufficient\" and \"full of outmoded training.\"\"President Tsai Announces Military Force Realignment Plan,\" Office of the President, December 27, 2022, https://english.president.gov.tw/NEWS/6417. Recognizing the imperative to modernize military training to face up to a rapidly expanding PLA threat, Taiwan's military force realignment plan came with a promise to \"include training in the use of Stinger missiles, Javelin missiles, Kestrel rockets, drones, and other new types of weapons . . . in accordance with mission requirements to meet the needs of modern warfare.\"\"President Tsai Announces Military Force Realignment Plan.\" Looking at the example of Ukraine, where drones have been utilized, underscores the importance of incorporating drone warfare training into its asymmetric strategy.\n\nThe Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act \"prioritize[d] realistic training\" by the United States, with Taiwan authorizing \"an enduring rotational United States military presence that assists Taiwan in maintaining force readiness.\"International Military Education and Training Cooperation with Taiwan, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 3353 (2022), https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/3353. There have been numerous reports of US special forces in Taiwan,Guy D. McCardl, \"US Army Special Forces to Be Deployed on Taiwanese Island Six Miles from Mainland China,\" SOFREP, March 8, 2024, https://sofrep.com/news/us-army-special-forces-to-be-deployed-on-taiwanese-island-six-miles-from-mainland-china/. and those forces could provide training in tactical air control, dynamic targeting, urban warfare, and comparable capabilities.\"Taiwan Defense Issues for Congress,\" Congressional Research Service, CRS Report R48044, updated May 10, 2024, https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R48044. Likewise, parts of an Army Security Force Assistance Brigade could do similar work on a rotational basis, on- or off-island.\n\nTo facilitate a comprehensive and integrated approach to defense planning and preparedness between the military, government agencies, and civilian organizations, Taiwan has also established the All-out Defense Mobilization Agency, which (as noted above) is a centralized body subordinate to the Ministry of National Defense that is tasked with coordinating efforts across various sectors, down to the local level, to enhance national defense readiness. That agency would be significantly more effective if raised to the national level with a broadened mandate as part of a comprehensive approach.\n\nThe Taiwanese leadership also should consider elevating their efforts to create a large-scale civil defense force, offering practical skills training which would appeal to Taiwanese willing to dedicate time and effort toward defense of their communities and localities. These skills could include emergency medical training, casualty evacuation, additive manufacturing, drone flying, and open-source intelligence. Private, nonprofit civil defense organizations such as Taiwan's Kuma Academy hold widespread appeal to citizens seeking to enhance basic preparedness skills.Jordyn Haime, \"NGOs Try to Bridge Taiwan's Civil Defense Gap,\" China Project, August 4, 2023, https://thechinaproject.com/2023/08/04/ngos-try-to-bridge-taiwans-civil-defense-gap/. With a curriculum that covers topics ranging from basic first aid to cognitive warfare, Kuma Academy's popular classes typically sell out within minutes of going online. According to a recent survey of domestic Taiwan opinions sponsored by Spirit of America, \"When facing external threats, 75.3% of the people agree that Taiwanese citizens have an obligation to defend Taiwan.\"Spirit of America, Taiwan Civic Engagement Survey, January 2024. A well-trained civil defense force and other whole-of-society resilience measures provide an additional layer of defense and enhance social cohesion to better deny Beijing's ultimate political objective of subjugating the will of the people.\n\nOn April 3, 2024, Taiwan was struck by the strongest earthquake in twenty-five years. In the face of this magnitude 7.4 quake, Taiwan's response highlights the effectiveness of robust investment in stricter building codes, earthquake alert systems, and resilience policies, resulting in minimal casualties and low infrastructure damage.Amy Hawkins and Chi Hui Lin, \"'As Well Prepared as They Could Be': How Taiwan Kept Death Toll Low in Massive Earthquake,\" Observer, April 7, 2024, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/07/as-well-prepared-as-they-could-be-how-taiwan-kept-death-toll-low-in-massive-earthquake. Taiwan's precarious position on the seismically vulnerable Ring of Fire, a belt of volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean, mirrors its vulnerability under constant threat of military and gray zone aggression from a mainland China seeking seismic changes in geopolitical power. Drawing from its success in preparing for and mitigating the impact of natural disasters, Taiwan can apply a similarly proactive approach in its defense preparedness. Safeguarding Taiwan's sovereignty and security requires investments in a comprehensive security strategy for resilience across society -- including cybersecurity for critical infrastructures, bolstering energy security, and enhanced defense resilience. Such an approach would provide Taiwan the greatest likelihood of deterring or, if necessary, defeating PRC aggression including through blockade or kinetic conflict.\n\nFranklin D.

This leadership role comes amid widespread concern over Hungary's democratic backsliding and its close ties with Russia. Known as one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies within the EU, Orban has frequently obstructed the bloc's efforts to support Ukraine and impose sanctions on Moscow.\n\nHungarian officials have stated that they will act as \"honest brokers\" in the EU Council leadership position.\n\nCritics of the Hungarian government say that it has centralized power, restricted media freedom, weakened judicial independence and altered electoral laws in order to benefit the Fidesz party, of which Orb\u00e1n is the leader.\n\nInternational bodies, including the EU, have expressed concerns that these actions undermine the principles of democracy.\n\nThe bloc has frozen more than $20 billion in funding to Budapest over alleged rule-of-law and corruption violations, according to the Associated Press. Orb\u00e1n has initiated numerous anti-EU communications campaigns where the body is depicted as repressive and overcentralized.\n\nWhile Hungary is not the only nation to hold back from condemning the war on Ukraine, it's stance is very different to many EU and NATO members. It has taken a mostly neutral position, pushing a generic message of peace.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to a representative of the Hungarian government via email for comment.\n\nAccording to Orb\u00e1n's spokesperson, Zoltan Kovacs, who confirmed Orb\u00e1n was in Kyiv, the focus of discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on achieving peace and addressing issues in Hungarian-Ukrainian relations.\n\nOrb\u00e1n has criticized Ukraine for what Budapest describes as inadequate protections for the rights of its Hungarian minority, Politico reported.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to a representative of the Ukrainian government via email for comment on the visit.\n\nThe visit follows an unofficial meeting between the two leaders on June 27. During the European Council summit in Brussels that day, Orb\u00e1n and Zelensky were seen having what was described as an animated and frank discussion.\n\nOrb\u00e1n's visit could signal a potential thaw in Hungarian-Ukrainian relations, especially as Ukraine continues to push for EU membership and greater support from European allies. As Hungary holds the EU presidency for the next six months, its role could influence the bloc's policies towards Ukraine and the broader geopolitical landscape.

        "body": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban arrived in Kyiv, Ukraine on Tuesday morning to promote a peace process, the day after he took over the Presidency of the European Council.\n\nViktor Orban took over the rotating presidency of the European Council on Monday, vowing to work for peace in Europe during his term, and promptly took up the longstanding invitation to travel to Kyiv from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a surprise trip Tuesday morning.\n\nA press spokesman for Mr Orban said of his intentions for the day, which will include talks with President Zelensky, statements, but no press conference: \"The most important topic of the discussion is the possibility of creating peace\". He said they would also discuss Hungarian-Ukrainian bilateral relations, which have tended to be reasonably poor in the past, Budapest accusing Kyiv of mistreating the nation's small Hungarian minority in its south-West.\n\nThis issue has also long been a sticking point in Ukraine's attempts to join the European Union, along with addressing corruption and the influence of oligarchs. The bloc opened formal membership talks with Kyiv last week, a major boost for the country.\n\nHungary's Orban has made clear working for peace in Europe will be the major focus of his time at the top of the European Council, the club of EU member state heads of state, which is chaired by a rotating presidency. On Monday as he took over the role from the Belgians, Mr Orban said the Russia-Ukraine war is the greatest threat presently facing Europe and said he wanted to be sure the continent is ready for what comes next.\n\nArticulating his view that President Trump will be the next U.S. President and will impose a ceasefire on Russia and Ukraine within days of taking office, which he says he believes will lead to peace negotiations, Orban warns of a situation where the United States and Russia negotiate between themselves on the future of a European nation without European leaders being at the table.\n\nSo while Orban's talk of peace is deeply unpopular among some European leaders, and has led to accusations of him being a Russian puppet, he insists being ready for such an outcome would be in the continent's interests. He said on Monday, per Hungarian media: \"Europe must prepare for the situation that sooner or later the Americans and the Russians will negotiate with each other... Where will Europe be in this [situation]? Who will represent your interests? What are your interests anyway?\".",

        "summary": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Kyiv, Ukraine, on Tuesday to promote peace talks, following his assumption of the European Council presidency on Monday. Orban's visit, at the invitation of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, aims to discuss peace possibilities and Hungarian-Ukrainian relations, which have been strained over the treatment of Ukraine's Hungarian minority. This issue has also impacted Ukraine's EU membership aspirations, although formal talks began last week. Orban's presidency will focus on peace in Europe, particularly concerning the Russia-Ukraine war. He predicts that a future U.S. President Trump will enforce a ceasefire, leading to peace negotiations, and stresses the need for Europe to be prepared for such developments. Despite criticism from some European leaders, Orban argues that Europe must ensure its interests are represented in any U.S.-Russia negotiations.",

        "title": "3 Defense Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash & Burn",
        "body": "Geopolitical turmoil continues unabated. There is no end in sight for the conflict raging in Gaza, and similar can be said about the Russia-Ukraine war. Unfortunate though true, a world embroiled in various clashes does create an opportunity to invest in defense stocks. The companies behind these \"Defense\" stocks sell weapons, defense systems, armored vehicles and drones to the U.S. government as well as its allies.\n\nThe iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEBATS:ITA), for example, is a $6.1 billion exchange-traded fund that has investments in 39 different. public aerospace firms and defense contracts. The ETF has seen a resurgence since early October last year and is up more than 22% since then.\n\nOf course, not all defense firms are a sure bet these days. Below are 3 clear defense stocks that investors should sell before their share prices crash and burn.\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nThe plane-maker and defense contractor Boeing (NYSE:BA) cannot seem to stay out of major headlines. In January, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737-MAX-9 plane suffered an emergency door blowout that catapulted a series of investigations into the plane-maker's manufacturing quality and scale capabilities. Shortly after the incident, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) started a high-profile investigation. And on the FAA's website, they have written, \"[the agency] has halted production expansion of the Boeing 737 MAX, is exploring the use of a third party to conduct independent reviews of quality systems.\" Similarly, in early May, the FAA has also began a probe into the production quality of Boeing's long-haul 787 Dreamliner jets. A model type that Boeing employees have been accused of falsifying safety documents.\n\nMost recently, the U.S Justice Department has offered a plea deal to the company for its role in the 2018 and 2019 737-MAX crashes, after the plane-maker had originally received a deferred prosecution agreement that had temporarily shielded it from criminal charges.\n\nBoeing's share price has been amongst the worst performers in the industrial sector. The plane-maker's share price has plummeted more than 30% since the start of the year. Ongoing investigations, a potential criminal prosecution and further finding of criminal negligence could send shares plummeting even more.\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR)\n\nArcher Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) is an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) manufacturer. eVTOL vehicles will be an interesting space within the urban transportation sector that investors should watch out for with enthusiasm. The idea is to provide travelers with an alternative, futuristic way in which to travel about a large urban dwelling. Most recently, the FAA has awarded Archer Aviation's \"Midnight\" eVTOL with a significant certificate that will allow it to fly commercially. This was after two long years of filing various documents. Archer Aviation's Midnight is a four-passenger aircraft with a range of 100 miles.\n\nHowever, Archer Aviation's stock price has been disappointing. Shares have fallen 42.7% on a year-to-date basis. While Archer does have a partnership with United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), which has ordered several of Archer's eVTOL aircrafts, there is a lot of competition in the space, from Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY), for example, and a lack of a pathway to profitability could keep shares trending downward.\n\nMercury Systems (MRCY)\n\nMercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY) is the final defense company to make this sell-list. In short, the firm manufactures and sells components, products, modules and subsystems to various companies within the defense and aerospace industry. Moreover, Mercury offers a variety of semiconductor components, including transceivers, switches and amplifiers as well as integrated circuit chips that compose different military technologies.\n\nUnfortunately, Mercury has also suffered from a plummeting stock price and declining earnings. In particular, MRCY shares fell 26.2% for the year as of the end of trading last Friday. At the end of 2023, Mercury management had seen its revenue and earnings decline for its Q2 2024 results due to elevated program and manufacturing costs. Furthermore, Mercury missed Wall Street estimates in their Q3 2024 earnings report.\n\nMore dreadful earnings seasons could send MRCY shares plummeting even more than it has currently, which should signal to current investors that MRCY is one of the defense stocks they will want to sell while they still can.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "summary": "The article advises investors to sell three specific defense stocks in July due to potential significant declines. The stocks in question are Boeing (BA), Archer Aviation (ACHR), and Mercury Systems (MRCY).\n\n1. **Boeing (BA)**: The company is facing multiple investigations by the FAA and the U.S. Justice Department related to manufacturing quality and safety issues, including the 737-MAX and 787 Dreamliner jets. Boeing's stock has already dropped over 30% this year, and ongoing legal and regulatory challenges could lead to further declines.\n\n2. **Archer Aviation (ACHR)**: Despite receiving FAA certification for its \"Midnight\" eVTOL aircraft and a partnership with United Airlines, Archer's stock has fallen 42.7% year-to-date. The company faces stiff competition and lacks a clear path to profitability, which could continue to negatively impact its stock price.\n\n3. **Mercury Systems (MRCY)**: The company has experienced a 26.2% drop in stock price this year due to declining earnings and missed Wall Street estimates. Increased program and manufacturing costs have further strained its financial performance, suggesting more potential declines.\n\nThe article concludes that these stocks are risky investments and should be sold before their prices potentially crash further.",

        "body": "Footage and images posted online appear to depict a squad of Russian troops on motorbikes coming under attack from Ukrainian forces.\n\nA video montage showed Russian tanks, armored vehicles and motorcycles engaged by Ukrainian drones and strikes. Images accompanying the video show over a dozen motorcycles scattered around an armored vehicle along a dirt road. The text at the end of the video lists targets \"destroyed\" by the \"Black Zaporozhians\" (a.k.a. Ukraine's 72 Mechanized Brigade), which includes 16 tanks and 19 motorcycles.\n\nThe video and images were posted online by Anton Gerashchenko, who has served as an adviser to Ukraine's internal affairs minister. Newsweek contacted the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministries for comment.\n\nThe post read: \"Vuhledar direction, Russian losses courtesy of Ukrainian Warriors from the 72 Separate Mechanized Brigade.\n\n\"Note the large number of burned and destroyed Russian motorcycles, sent into combat together with heavy equipment - the Russian soldiers were sent into the meat grinder consciously.\"\n\nUkrainian officials on Monday claimed that Russia lost its highest-ever number of artillery systems in a one-month period. An official post from the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that 1,415 Russian artillery systems were destroyed in June, which it said was a record since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nKyiv also claimed that 1,160 artillery systems were destroyed in May, putting Moscow's artillery losses at around 14,600.\n\nThe posts didn't clarify where the data used in the report originated, however. Russia doesn't publish its military losses, and analysts are skeptical of reports by both sides.\n\nUkraine also claimed Russia suffered its second-highest monthly personnel losses in June - 35,030 soldiers.\n\nThe British government estimated in May that Russia's total casualties had likely reached half a million.\n\nMoscow's forces are pushing to make significant gains in eastern Ukraine, and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which comprise the Donbas area, are suffering constant shelling. Russia's tactics include digging tunnels to get behind enemy lines and launch attacks, according to its defense ministry.\n\nUkraine has also been focusing its efforts on the occupied Crimean peninsula, which it has pledged to retake.\n\nRussia has accused Ukrainian forces of using U.S.-made ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile Systems) to attack targets in Crimea. The Russian Union of Travel Industry (RUTI) said Sunday that there had been a 25 to 30 percent decline in bookings in Crimea after debris from Ukrainian missiles intercepted by air defenses landed on a beach in the port city of Sevastopol on June 23.\n\nDo you have a story we should be covering?

        "body": "After Supreme Court immunity ruling, Biden draws sharp contrast with Trump on obeying rule of law\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden warns that a Supreme Court ruling granting presidents broad immunity from prosecution would make an unchecked Republican Donald Trump \"more emboldened to do whatever he wants\" if he regains the White House in November's election. Biden has been under intense pressure after his disastrous debate performance against Trump last week. He urged Americans on Monday to think carefully about their election decision and signaled he had no intention of dropping out of the race. Biden's effort to reset his campaign following his performance, which spooked donors and stirred up major Democratic anxiety, has been looking a lot like his past attempts to keep the focus squarely on Trump's misdeeds and shortcomings.\n\nTrump seeks to set aside New York hush money verdict hours after Supreme Court ruling\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's lawyers have sent a letter to the Manhattan judge in his hush money criminal case seeking permission to file a motion to set aside the verdict. The letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan cited the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling earlier Monday and asked the judge to delay Trump's sentencing while he weighs the high court's decision and how it could influence the New York case. The Associated Press obtained the letter Monday night. The lawyers argue that the Supreme Court's decision confirmed a defense position that prosecutors should have been precluded from introducing some evidence they said constituted official presidential acts.\n\nHighlights from Supreme Court term: Rulings on Trump, regulation, abortion, guns and homelessness\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ended its term by ruling for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, a decision that almost certainly means Donald Trump won't stand trial before the November election. That closely watched ruling was far from the only opinion handed down in the court's busy final few weeks, though. The court also dealt this session with cases involving gun control, regulatory powers, abortion, social media, homelessness and the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHurricane Beryl grows to Category 5 strength as it razes southeast Caribbean islands\n\nBRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) -- Hurricane Beryl has strengthened to Category 5 status as it crosses islands in the southeastern Caribbean. Beryl ripped off doors, windows and roofs in homes across the southeastern Caribbean on Monday. It had been the earliest Category 4 storm in the Atlantic, fueled by its record warm waters. Grenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said late Monday that one person had died and authorities had not been able to assess the situation on some hard-hit islands. Late Monday, Beryl's winds increased to 160 mph. Fluctuations in strength were likely in the coming days. Beryl was moving west-northwest. It was forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael orders Palestinians to flee Khan Younis, signaling likely new assault on southern Gaza city\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Israeli army has ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians from much of Gaza's second-largest city, Khan Younis. Monday's order is a sign that Israeli troops could soon return to the southern city. It's also an indication that Hamas has regrouped there. Israel wrapped up an offensive in Khan Younis earlier this year and withdrew most of its forces. Israel has said it is in the final stages of an offensive in the nearby Gaza city of Rafah. The new evacuation zone includes the major aid crossing to southern Gaza, along with an aid route inside the territory that Israel has said it would safeguard.\n\nIranian presidential candidates accuse each other of having no plan or experience ahead of runoff\n\nTEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's two presidential candidates are accusing each other of having no solution for the country's problems ahead of Friday's runoff. The election is aimed at choosing a successor for the late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died last month in a helicopter crash. During a more than two-hour debate on public TV, reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian attacked his competitor, Saeed Jalili, a hard-line former nuclear negotiator, for his lack of experience. Jalili, who is known as the \"Living Martyr\" after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, defended himself highlighting his career and positions held, including that of top nuclear negotiator. The candidates will have their second and last debate Tuesday.\n\nHaiti's gang violence has displaced 300,000 children, the UN says\n\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.N. says criminal gang violence in Haiti has displaced more than 300,000 children since March. UNICEF said Tuesday that children are more than half of the nearly 580,000 people that have been internally displaced so far in the last four months. The spike in violence by armed gangs began in late February after a series of coordinated attacks that led Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign. Criminal gangs control 80% of the capital and the key roads leading in and out of it. Many children are living in makeshift shelters and schools are in poor condition. The agency said children lacking access to food, health and hygiene may be forced to join the gangs to survive.\n\nAhead of election, Venezuela's Maduro says he has agreed to resume negotiations with United States\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro says Venezuela's government plans to resume negotiations with the U.S. government this week. His announcement Monday comes less than a month before a highly anticipated election in which he is seeking a third term. Maduro wants the U.S. to lift crippling economic sanctions and characterized the dialogue as \"urgent.\" It was not immediately clear whether the U.S. government has agreed. The July 28 election is shaping up to be the biggest challenge the ruling party has faced in its 25 years of dominance.\n\nTrump says he can end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day. Russia's UN ambassador says he can't\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Donald Trump has said repeatedly he can settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. When asked Monday to respond to the claim from the presumptive Republican nominee, Russia's United Nations Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters \"the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\" Trump has repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail that he wanted Russians and Ukrainians to stop dying and that he would \"have that done in 24 hours.\" Nebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 but the West blocked it.\n\nUS eliminated from Copa America with 1-0 loss to Uruguay, increasing pressure to fire Berhalter\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The United States was eliminated from the Copa America with a 1-0 loss to Uruguay on a questionable second-half goal by Math\u00edas Olivera, a defeat that will increase pressure on the U.S. Soccer Federation to remove coach Gregg Berhalter before the 2026 World Cup. Uruguay scored when Nicolas De La Cruz swung a free kick in front of the U.S. goal. Matt Turner parried a header by Ronald Ara\u00fajo, who outjumped defender Tim Ream, but the rebound went right to Mathias Olivera and he tapped the ball in with his left foot. Olivera appeared to be offside on the initial header.",

        "body": "After Supreme Court immunity ruling, Biden draws sharp contrast with Trump on obeying rule of law\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden warns that a Supreme Court ruling granting presidents broad immunity from prosecution would make an unchecked Republican Donald Trump \"more emboldened to do whatever he wants\" if he regains the White House in November's election. Biden has been under intense pressure after his disastrous debate performance against Trump last week. He urged Americans on Monday to think carefully about their election decision and signaled he had no intention of dropping out of the race. Biden's effort to reset his campaign following his performance, which spooked donors and stirred up major Democratic anxiety, has been looking a lot like his past attempts to keep the focus squarely on Trump's misdeeds and shortcomings.\n\nTrump seeks to set aside New York hush money verdict hours after Supreme Court ruling\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's lawyers have sent a letter to the Manhattan judge in his hush money criminal case seeking permission to file a motion to set aside the verdict. The letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan cited the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling earlier Monday and asked the judge to delay Trump's sentencing while he weighs the high court's decision and how it could influence the New York case. The Associated Press obtained the letter Monday night. The lawyers argue that the Supreme Court's decision confirmed a defense position that prosecutors should have been precluded from introducing some evidence they said constituted official presidential acts.\n\nHighlights from Supreme Court term: Rulings on Trump, regulation, abortion, guns and homelessness\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ended its term by ruling for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, a decision that almost certainly means Donald Trump won't stand trial before the November election. That closely watched ruling was far from the only opinion handed down in the court's busy final few weeks, though. The court also dealt this session with cases involving gun control, regulatory powers, abortion, social media, homelessness and the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHurricane Beryl grows to Category 5 strength as it razes southeast Caribbean islands\n\nBRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) -- Hurricane Beryl has strengthened to Category 5 status as it crosses islands in the southeastern Caribbean. Beryl ripped off doors, windows and roofs in homes across the southeastern Caribbean on Monday. It had been the earliest Category 4 storm in the Atlantic, fueled by its record warm waters. Grenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said late Monday that one person had died and authorities had not been able to assess the situation on some hard-hit islands. Late Monday, Beryl's winds increased to 160 mph. Fluctuations in strength were likely in the coming days. Beryl was moving west-northwest. It was forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael orders Palestinians to flee Khan Younis, signaling likely new assault on southern Gaza city\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Israeli army has ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians from much of Gaza's second-largest city, Khan Younis. Monday's order is a sign that Israeli troops could soon return to the southern city. It's also an indication that Hamas has regrouped there. Israel wrapped up an offensive in Khan Younis earlier this year and withdrew most of its forces. Israel has said it is in the final stages of an offensive in the nearby Gaza city of Rafah. The new evacuation zone includes the major aid crossing to southern Gaza, along with an aid route inside the territory that Israel has said it would safeguard.\n\nHaiti's gang violence has displaced 300,000 children, the UN says\n\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.N. says criminal gang violence in Haiti has displaced more than 300,000 children since March. UNICEF said Tuesday that children are more than half of the nearly 580,000 people that have been internally displaced so far in the last four months. The spike in violence by armed gangs began in late February after a series of coordinated attacks that led Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign. Criminal gangs control 80% of the capital and the key roads leading in and out of it. Many children are living in makeshift shelters and schools are in poor condition. The agency said children lacking access to food, health and hygiene may be forced to join the gangs to survive.\n\nAhead of election, Venezuela's Maduro says he has agreed to resume negotiations with United States\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro says Venezuela's government plans to resume negotiations with the U.S. government this week. His announcement Monday comes less than a month before a highly anticipated election in which he is seeking a third term. Maduro wants the U.S. to lift crippling economic sanctions and characterized the dialogue as \"urgent.\" It was not immediately clear whether the U.S. government has agreed. The July 28 election is shaping up to be the biggest challenge the ruling party has faced in its 25 years of dominance.\n\nAt 28, Bardella could become youngest French prime minister at helm of far-right National Rally\n\nNICE, France (AP) -- At just 28 years old, Jordan Bardella has helped make the far-right National Rally the strongest political force in France. And now he could become the country's youngest prime minister. Voters propelled Marine Le Pen's National Rally to a strong lead in the first round of snap legislative elections on Sunday. And now Bardella is rallying supporters to hand their party an absolute majority in the decisive round of voting on July 7. That would allow the anti-immigration, nationalist party to run the government, with Bardella at the helm.\n\nTrump says he can end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day. Russia's UN ambassador says he can't\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Donald Trump has said repeatedly he can settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. When asked Monday to respond to the claim from the presumptive Republican nominee, Russia's United Nations Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters \"the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\" Trump has repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail that he wanted Russians and Ukrainians to stop dying and that he would \"have that done in 24 hours.\" Nebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 but the West blocked it.\n\nUS eliminated from Copa America with 1-0 loss to Uruguay, increasing pressure to fire Berhalter\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The United States was eliminated from the Copa America with a 1-0 loss to Uruguay on a questionable second-half goal by Math\u00edas Olivera, a defeat that will increase pressure on the U.S. Soccer Federation to remove coach Gregg Berhalter before the 2026 World Cup. Uruguay scored when Nicolas De La Cruz swung a free kick in front of the U.S. goal. Matt Turner parried a header by Ronald Ara\u00fajo, who outjumped defender Tim Ream, but the rebound went right to Mathias Olivera and he tapped the ball in with his left foot. Olivera appeared to be offside on the initial header.\n\nMore from this section\n\nMAGLITE, The Pedestrian Safety Institute, Additional Partners to Promote Traffic and Pedestrian Safety During 2024 National Roadside Traffic Safety Awareness Month\n\nDown Payment Resource expands team to keep pace with a rising number of DPA programs and increasing demand\n\nSimone Biles headlines a U.S. women's gymnastics team eyeing redemption at the Paris Olympics",

During his brief remarks Monday, he made no mention of last week's debate or his performance, and did not take questions, delivering an unusually political message from the White House.\n\nTrump seeks to set aside New York hush money verdict hours after Supreme Court ruling\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's lawyers on Monday asked the New York judge who presided over his hush money trial to set aside his conviction and delay his sentencing, scheduled for next week.\n\nThe letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan cited the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling earlier Monday and asked the judge to delay Trump's sentencing while he weighs the high court's decision and how it could influence the New York case, according to the letter obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe lawyers argue that the Supreme Court's decision confirmed a position the defense raised earlier in the case that prosecutors should have been precluded from introducing some evidence they said constituted official presidential acts, according to the letter.\n\nIn prior court filings, Trump contended he is immune from prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office. His lawyers did not raise that as a defense in the hush money case, but they argued that some evidence -- including Trump's social media posts about former lawyer Michael Cohen -- comes from his time as president and should have been excluded from the trial because of immunity protections.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office declined comment Monday night.\n\nHighlights from Supreme Court term: Rulings on Trump, regulation, abortion, guns and homelessness\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ended its term by ruling for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, a decision that almost certainly means Donald Trump won't stand trial before the November election. That closely watched ruling, which drew sharp dissent from the minority justices, was among a cluster of consequential opinions handed down in the court's busy final few weeks.\n\nHere's a look at the major cases the court decided this year.\n\nRuled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution in a decision that extends the delay in Donald Trump's trial in Washington on charges of election interference and all but rules out a trial before the November election. The justices returned the case to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who would preside over a trial. She must now sort out what is left of special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of the former president.\n\nMajority: Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito, Justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Justice Amy Coney Barrett\n\nDissent: Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Elena Kagan, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nHurricane Beryl grows to Category 5 strength as it razes southeast Caribbean islands\n\nBRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) -- Hurricane Beryl strengthened to Category 5 status late Monday after it ripped doors, windows and roofs off homes across the southeastern Caribbean with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nBeryl made landfall on the island of Carriacou in Grenada as the earliest Category 4 storm in the Atlantic, then late in the day the National Hurricane Center in Miami said its winds had increased to 160 mph (260 kph). Fluctuations in strength were likely in the coming days as the storm pushed further into the Caribbean.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said one person had died and he could not yet say if there were other fatalities because authorities had not been able to assess the situation on the islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique, where there were initial reports of major damage but communications were largely down.\n\n\"We do hope there aren't any other fatalities or any injuries,\" he said. \"But bear in mind the challenge we have in Carriacou and Petite Martinique.\" Mitchel added that the government will send people first thing Tuesday morning to evaluate the situation on the islands.\n\nStreets from St. Lucia island south to Grenada were strewn with shoes, trees, downed power lines and other debris. Banana trees were snapped in half and cows lay dead in green pastures with homes made of tin and plywood tilting precariously nearby.\n\nIsrael orders Palestinians to flee Khan Younis, signaling likely new assault on southern Gaza city\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Israeli army ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians from much of Khan Younis on Monday, a sign that troops are likely to launch a new ground assault into the Gaza Strip's second-largest city.\n\nThe order suggests Khan Younis will be the latest target of Israel's raids into parts of Gaza it had previously invaded in the war, as it pursues regrouping Hamas militants. Much of Khan Younis was destroyed in a long assault earlier this year, but large numbers of Palestinians had moved back to escape another Israeli offensive in Gaza's southernmost city, Rafah.\n\nThe evacuation came as Israel released the director of what was once Gaza's largest hospital after holding him for seven months without charge or trial. Israel alleged the hospital had been used as a Hamas command center, which he and other Palestinian health officials have denied. The doctor said he and other detainees were held under harsh conditions and tortured.\n\nThe decision to release Mohammed Abu Selmia raised questions over Israel's claims surrounding Shifa Hospital, which Israeli forces have raided twice since the start of the war with Hamas. The hospital was left severely damaged after the raids.\n\nAbu Selmia's release triggered an uproar across Israel's political spectrum. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office called it \"a grave mistake.\" Government ministers and opposition leaders expressed outrage and insisted Abu Selmia played a role in Hamas' alleged use of the hospital -- although Israeli security services rarely unilaterally free prisoners if they have a suspicion of militant links.\n\nFlorida prosecutors knew Epstein raped teenage girls 2 years before cutting deal, transcript shows\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida prosecutors knew the late millionaire and financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually assaulted teenage girls two years before they cut a plea deal that has long been criticized as too lenient and a missed opportunity to imprison him a decade earlier, according to transcripts released Monday.\n\nThe 2006 grand jury investigation was the first of many by law enforcement over the past two decades into Epstein's rape and sex trafficking of teenagers -- and how his ties to the rich and the powerful seem to have allowed him to avoid prison or a serious jail term for over a decade.\n\nThe investigations uncovered Epstein's close ties to former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew, as well as his once friendly relationship with former President Donald Trump and numerous others of wealth and influence who have denied doing anything criminal or improper and not been charged.\n\nCircuit Judge Luis Delgado's release of approximately 150 pages Monday came as a surprise, since there was scheduled hearing next week over unsealing the graphic testimony. Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed a bill in February allowing the release on Monday or any time thereafter that Delgado ordered. Florida grand jury transcripts are usually kept secret forever, but the bill created an exemption for cases like Epstein's.\n\nThe transcripts show that the grand jury heard testimony that Epstein, who was then in his 40s, had raped teenage girls as young as 14 at his Palm Beach mansion, often paying them so he could commit statutory rape or assault. The teenagers testified and told detectives they were also paid cash or rented cars if they found him more girls.\n\nAhead of election, Venezuela's Maduro says he has agreed to resume negotiations with United States\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's government plans to resume negotiations with the U.S. government this week, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced Monday, less than a month before a highly anticipated election in which he and his party are facing their toughest challenge in decades.\n\nMaduro, who is seeking a third term, wants the U.S. government to lift crippling economic sanctions that were imposed over the last decade in an effort to topple him. He characterized the dialogue as \"urgent\" during his weekly TV show.\n\nThe Biden administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\n\"I have received the proposal during two continuous months from the United States government to reestablish talks and direct dialogue,\" Maduro said. \"After thinking about it for two months, I have accepted, and next Wednesday, talks will restart with the United States government to comply with the agreements signed in Qatar and to reestablish the terms of the urgent dialogue.\"\n\nMaduro's government had held parallel talks with the Biden administration and with the U.S.-backed Unitary Platform opposition coalition. But they were suspended as he reneged on promises, including to improve conditions ahead of the election, and his government accused the U.S. of not fulfilling portions of agreements.\n\nAt 28, Bardella could become youngest French prime minister at helm of far-right National Rally\n\nNICE, France (AP) -- At just 28 years old, Jordan Bardella has helped make the far-right National Rally the strongest political force in France. And now he could become the country's youngest prime minister.\n\nAfter voters propelled Marine Le Pen's National Rally to a strong lead in Sunday's first round of snap legislative elections, Bardella turned to rallying supporters to hand their party an absolute majority in the decisive round on July 7. That would allow the anti-immigration, nationalist party to run the government, with Bardella at the helm.\n\nWhen Bardella replaced his mentor, Marine Le Pen, in 2022 at the helm of France's leading far-right party, he became the first person without the Le Pen name to lead it since its founding a half-century ago.\n\nHis selection marked a symbolic changing of the guard. It was part of Le Pen's decade-long effort to rebrand her party, with its history of racism, and remove the stigma of antisemitism that clung to it in order to broaden its base. She has notably distanced herself from her now-ostracized father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who co-founded the party, then called the National Front, and who has been repeatedly convicted of hate speech.\n\nBardella is part of a generation of young people who joined the party under Marine Le Pen in the 2010s but likely wouldn't have done so under her father.\n\nTrump says he can end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day. Russia's UN ambassador says he can't\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Donald Trump has said repeatedly he could settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. Russia's United Nations ambassador says he can't.\n\nWhen asked to respond to the claim from the presumptive Republican nominee, Vassily Nebenzia told reporters Monday that \"the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\"\n\nAt a CNN town hall in May 2023, Trump said: \"They're dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I'll have that done -- I'll have that done in 24 hours.\" He said that would happen after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. And he keeps repeating the claim on the campaign trail.\n\nDuring last week's debate with President Joe Biden, Trump claimed, \"If we had a real president, a president that knew -- that was respected by Putin ... he would have never invaded Ukraine.\"\n\nNebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 in Istanbul when Russia and Ukraine were \"very close\" to an agreement. Moscow invaded its neighbor two months earlier on Feb. 24, 2022, though Russia insists its \"special military operation\" began in 2014 after clashes in Ukraine's east resulted in Moscow seizing the Crimea Peninsula.\n\nUS eliminated from Copa America with 1-0 loss to Uruguay, increasing pressure to fire Berhalter\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The United States was eliminated from the Copa America with a 1-0 loss to Uruguay on Math\u00edas Olivera's questionable second-half goal Monday night, a defeat sure to increase pressure on the U.S. Soccer Federation to remove coach Gregg Berhalter before the 2026 World Cup.\n\nUruguay scored in the 66th minute when Nicolas De La Cruz swung a free kick in front of the U.S. goal. Matt Turner parried a header by Ronald Ara\u00fajo, who out-jumped defender Tim Ream, but the rebound went right to Mathias Olivera and he tapped the ball in with his left foot.\n\nOlivera appeared to be offside on the initial header but the goal stood after a video review.\n\nUsing a lineup of players entirely from European clubs, Berhalter and the U.S. hoped to show the team had advanced since its round-of-16 elimination against the Netherlands at the 2022 World Cup. Instead, the U.S. managed only a 2-0 win over lowly Bolivia and were upset 2-1 by Panama, putting it in a tough situation Monday night.\n\n\"We had a good start and brought a lot of energy but at the end of the day, just not enough quality,\" U.S. captain Christian Pulisic said. \"I felt like we gave it everything but we just couldn't score.\"",

        "body": "After Supreme Court immunity ruling, Biden draws sharp contrast with Trump on obeying rule of law\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden warns that a Supreme Court ruling granting presidents broad immunity from prosecution would make an unchecked Republican Donald Trump \"more emboldened to do whatever he wants\" if he regains the White House in November's election. Biden has been under intense pressure after his disastrous debate performance against Trump last week. He urged Americans on Monday to think carefully about their election decision and signaled he had no intention of dropping out of the race. Biden's effort to reset his campaign following his performance, which spooked donors and stirred up major Democratic anxiety, has been looking a lot like his past attempts to keep the focus squarely on Trump's misdeeds and shortcomings.\n\nTrump seeks to set aside New York hush money verdict hours after Supreme Court ruling\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's lawyers have sent a letter to the Manhattan judge in his hush money criminal case seeking permission to file a motion to set aside the verdict. The letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan cited the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling earlier Monday and asked the judge to delay Trump's sentencing while he weighs the high court's decision and how it could influence the New York case. The Associated Press obtained the letter Monday night. The lawyers argue that the Supreme Court's decision confirmed a defense position that prosecutors should have been precluded from introducing some evidence they said constituted official presidential acts.\n\nHighlights from Supreme Court term: Rulings on Trump, regulation, abortion, guns and homelessness\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ended its term by ruling for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, a decision that almost certainly means Donald Trump won't stand trial before the November election. That closely watched ruling was far from the only opinion handed down in the court's busy final few weeks, though. The court also dealt this session with cases involving gun control, regulatory powers, abortion, social media, homelessness and the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHurricane Beryl grows to Category 5 strength as it razes southeast Caribbean islands\n\nBRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) -- Hurricane Beryl has strengthened to Category 5 status as it crosses islands in the southeastern Caribbean. Beryl ripped off doors, windows and roofs in homes across the southeastern Caribbean on Monday. It had been the earliest Category 4 storm in the Atlantic, fueled by its record warm waters. Grenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said late Monday that one person had died and authorities had not been able to assess the situation on some hard-hit islands. Late Monday, Beryl's winds increased to 160 mph. Fluctuations in strength were likely in the coming days. Beryl was moving west-northwest. It was forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael orders Palestinians to flee Khan Younis, signaling likely new assault on southern Gaza city\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Israeli army has ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians from much of Gaza's second largest city, Khan Younis. Monday's order is a sign that Israeli troops could soon return to the southern city. It's also an indication that Hamas has regrouped there. Israel wrapped up an offensive in Khan Younis earlier this year and withdrew most of its forces. Israel has said it is in the final stages of an offensive in the nearby Gaza city of Rafah. The new evacuation zone includes the major aid crossing to southern Gaza, along with an aid route inside the territory that Israel has said it would safeguard.\n\nFlorida prosecutors knew Epstein raped teenage girls 2 years before cutting deal, transcript shows\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A Florida judge has released transcripts detailing 2006 grand jury testimony that accused the late millionaire and financier Jeffrey Epstein of sexually assaulting numerous underage teenage girls at his Palm Beach mansion. A circuit judge's release Monday afternoon of the approximately 150 pages came as a surprise as there's a scheduled hearing for next week on when and how to release them. Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed a bill in February allowing their release on Monday or any time thereafter that the judge ordered. One girl testified that she was paid $300 to give Epstein a sexual massage and $200 every time she recruited a friend.\n\nAhead of election, Venezuela's Maduro says he has agreed to resume negotiations with United States\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro says Venezuela's government plans to resume negotiations with the U.S. government this week. His announcement Monday comes less than a month before a highly anticipated election in which he is seeking a third term. Maduro wants the U.S. to lift crippling economic sanctions and characterized the dialogue as \"urgent.\" It was not immediately clear whether the U.S. government has agreed. The July 28 election is shaping up to be the biggest challenge the ruling party has faced in its 25 years of dominance.\n\nAt 28, Bardella could become youngest French prime minister at helm of far-right National Rally\n\nNICE, France (AP) -- At just 28 years old, Jordan Bardella has helped make the far-right National Rally the strongest political force in France. And now he could become the country's youngest prime minister. Voters propelled Marine Le Pen's National Rally to a strong lead in the first round of snap legislative elections on Sunday. And now Bardella is rallying supporters to hand their party an absolute majority in the decisive round of voting on July 7. That would allow the anti-immigration, nationalist party to run the government, with Bardella at the helm.\n\nTrump says he can end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day. Russia's UN ambassador says he can't\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Donald Trump has said repeatedly he can settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. When asked Monday to respond to the claim from the presumptive Republican nominee, Russia's United Nations Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters \"the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\" Trump has repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail that he wanted Russians and Ukrainians to stop dying and that he would \"have that done in 24 hours.\" Nebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 but the West blocked it.\n\nUS eliminated from Copa America with 1-0 loss to Uruguay, increasing pressure to fire Berhalter\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The United States was eliminated from the Copa America with a 1-0 loss to Uruguay on a questionable second-half goal by Math\u00edas Olivera, a defeat that will increase pressure on the U.S. Soccer Federation to remove coach Gregg Berhalter before the 2026 World Cup. Uruguay scored when Nicolas De La Cruz swung a free kick in front of the U.S. goal. Matt Turner parried a header by Ronald Ara\u00fajo, who outjumped defender Tim Ream, but the rebound went right to Mathias Olivera and he tapped the ball in with his left foot. Olivera appeared to be offside on the initial header.",

During his brief remarks Monday, he made no mention of last week's debate or his performance, and did not take questions, delivering an unusually political message from the White House.\n\nTrump seeks to set aside New York hush money verdict hours after Supreme Court ruling\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump's lawyers on Monday asked the New York judge who presided over his hush money trial to set aside his conviction and delay his sentencing, scheduled for next week.\n\nThe letter to Judge Juan M. Merchan cited the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling earlier Monday and asked the judge to delay Trump's sentencing while he weighs the high court's decision and how it could influence the New York case, according to the letter obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe lawyers argue that the Supreme Court's decision confirmed a position the defense raised earlier in the case that prosecutors should have been precluded from introducing some evidence they said constituted official presidential acts, according to the letter.\n\nIn prior court filings, Trump contended he is immune from prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office. His lawyers did not raise that as a defense in the hush money case, but they argued that some evidence -- including Trump's social media posts about former lawyer Michael Cohen -- comes from his time as president and should have been excluded from the trial because of immunity protections.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office declined comment Monday night.\n\nHighlights from Supreme Court term: Rulings on Trump, regulation, abortion, guns and homelessness\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ended its term by ruling for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, a decision that almost certainly means Donald Trump won't stand trial before the November election. That closely watched ruling, which drew sharp dissent from the minority justices, was among a cluster of consequential opinions handed down in the court's busy final few weeks.\n\nHere's a look at the major cases the court decided this year.\n\nRuled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution in a decision that extends the delay in Donald Trump's trial in Washington on charges of election interference and all but rules out a trial before the November election. The justices returned the case to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who would preside over a trial. She must now sort out what is left of special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of the former president.\n\nMajority: Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito, Justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Justice Amy Coney Barrett\n\nDissent: Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Elena Kagan, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nHurricane Beryl grows to Category 5 strength as it razes southeast Caribbean islands\n\nBRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) -- Hurricane Beryl strengthened to Category 5 status late Monday after it ripped doors, windows and roofs off homes across the southeastern Caribbean with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nBeryl made landfall on the island of Carriacou in Grenada as the earliest Category 4 storm in the Atlantic, then late in the day the National Hurricane Center in Miami said its winds had increased to 160 mph (260 kph). Fluctuations in strength were likely in the coming days as the storm pushed further into the Caribbean.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said one person had died and he could not yet say if there were other fatalities because authorities had not been able to assess the situation on the islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique, where there were initial reports of major damage but communications were largely down.\n\n\"We do hope there aren't any other fatalities or any injuries,\" he said. \"But bear in mind the challenge we have in Carriacou and Petite Martinique.\" Mitchel added that the government will send people first thing Tuesday morning to evaluate the situation on the islands.\n\nStreets from St. Lucia island south to Grenada were strewn with shoes, trees, downed power lines and other debris. Banana trees were snapped in half and cows lay dead in green pastures with homes made of tin and plywood tilting precariously nearby.\n\nIsrael orders Palestinians to flee Khan Younis, signaling likely new assault on southern Gaza city\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Israeli army ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians from much of Khan Younis on Monday, a sign that troops are likely to launch a new ground assault into the Gaza Strip's second-largest city.\n\nThe order suggests Khan Younis will be the latest target of Israel's raids into parts of Gaza it had previously invaded in the war, as it pursues regrouping Hamas militants. Much of Khan Younis was destroyed in a long assault earlier this year, but large numbers of Palestinians had moved back to escape another Israeli offensive in Gaza's southernmost city, Rafah.\n\nThe evacuation came as Israel released the director of what was once Gaza's largest hospital after holding him for seven months without charge or trial. Israel alleged the hospital had been used as a Hamas command center, which he and other Palestinian health officials have denied. The doctor said he and other detainees were held under harsh conditions and tortured.\n\nThe decision to release Mohammed Abu Selmia raised questions over Israel's claims surrounding Shifa Hospital, which Israeli forces have raided twice since the start of the war with Hamas. The hospital was left severely damaged after the raids.\n\nAbu Selmia's release triggered an uproar across Israel's political spectrum. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office called it \"a grave mistake.\" Government ministers and opposition leaders expressed outrage and insisted Abu Selmia played a role in Hamas' alleged use of the hospital -- although Israeli security services rarely unilaterally free prisoners if they have a suspicion of militant links.\n\nFlorida prosecutors knew Epstein raped teenage girls 2 years before cutting deal, transcript shows\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida prosecutors knew the late millionaire and financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually assaulted teenage girls two years before they cut a plea deal that has long been criticized as too lenient and a missed opportunity to imprison him a decade earlier, according to transcripts released Monday.\n\nThe 2006 grand jury investigation was the first of many by law enforcement over the past two decades into Epstein's rape and sex trafficking of teenagers -- and how his ties to the rich and the powerful seem to have allowed him to avoid prison or a serious jail term for over a decade.\n\nThe investigations uncovered Epstein's close ties to former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew, as well as his once friendly relationship with former President Donald Trump and numerous others of wealth and influence who have denied doing anything criminal or improper and not been charged.\n\nCircuit Judge Luis Delgado's release of approximately 150 pages Monday came as a surprise, since there was scheduled hearing next week over unsealing the graphic testimony. Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed a bill in February allowing the release on Monday or any time thereafter that Delgado ordered. Florida grand jury transcripts are usually kept secret forever, but the bill created an exemption for cases like Epstein's.\n\nThe transcripts show that the grand jury heard testimony that Epstein, who was then in his 40s, had raped teenage girls as young as 14 at his Palm Beach mansion, often paying them so he could commit statutory rape or assault. The teenagers testified and told detectives they were also paid cash or rented cars if they found him more girls.\n\nAhead of election, Venezuela's Maduro says he has agreed to resume negotiations with United States\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's government plans to resume negotiations with the U.S. government this week, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced Monday, less than a month before a highly anticipated election in which he and his party are facing their toughest challenge in decades.\n\nMaduro, who is seeking a third term, wants the U.S. government to lift crippling economic sanctions that were imposed over the last decade in an effort to topple him. He characterized the dialogue as \"urgent\" during his weekly TV show.\n\nThe Biden administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\n\"I have received the proposal during two continuous months from the United States government to reestablish talks and direct dialogue,\" Maduro said. \"After thinking about it for two months, I have accepted, and next Wednesday, talks will restart with the United States government to comply with the agreements signed in Qatar and to reestablish the terms of the urgent dialogue.\"\n\nMaduro's government had held parallel talks with the Biden administration and with the U.S.-backed Unitary Platform opposition coalition. But they were suspended as he reneged on promises, including to improve conditions ahead of the election, and his government accused the U.S. of not fulfilling portions of agreements.\n\nAt 28, Bardella could become youngest French prime minister at helm of far-right National Rally\n\nNICE, France (AP) -- At just 28 years old, Jordan Bardella has helped make the far-right National Rally the strongest political force in France. And now he could become the country's youngest prime minister.\n\nAfter voters propelled Marine Le Pen's National Rally to a strong lead in Sunday's first round of snap legislative elections, Bardella turned to rallying supporters to hand their party an absolute majority in the decisive round on July 7. That would allow the anti-immigration, nationalist party to run the government, with Bardella at the helm.\n\nWhen Bardella replaced his mentor, Marine Le Pen, in 2022 at the helm of France's leading far-right party, he became the first person without the Le Pen name to lead it since its founding a half-century ago.\n\nHis selection marked a symbolic changing of the guard. It was part of Le Pen's decade-long effort to rebrand her party, with its history of racism, and remove the stigma of antisemitism that clung to it in order to broaden its base. She has notably distanced herself from her now-ostracized father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who co-founded the party, then called the National Front, and who has been repeatedly convicted of hate speech.\n\nBardella is part of a generation of young people who joined the party under Marine Le Pen in the 2010s but likely wouldn't have done so under her father.\n\nTrump says he can end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day. Russia's UN ambassador says he can't\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Donald Trump has said repeatedly he could settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he's elected president again. Russia's United Nations ambassador says he can't.\n\nWhen asked to respond to the claim from the presumptive Republican nominee, Vassily Nebenzia told reporters Monday that \"the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\"\n\nAt a CNN town hall in May 2023, Trump said: \"They're dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I'll have that done -- I'll have that done in 24 hours.\" He said that would happen after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. And he keeps repeating the claim on the campaign trail.\n\nDuring last week's debate with President Joe Biden, Trump claimed, \"If we had a real president, a president that knew -- that was respected by Putin ... he would have never invaded Ukraine.\"\n\nNebenzia said the war could have ended in April 2022 in Istanbul when Russia and Ukraine were \"very close\" to an agreement. Moscow invaded its neighbor two months earlier on Feb. 24, 2022, though Russia insists its \"special military operation\" began in 2014 after clashes in Ukraine's east resulted in Moscow seizing the Crimea Peninsula.\n\nUS eliminated from Copa America with 1-0 loss to Uruguay, increasing pressure to fire Berhalter\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The United States was eliminated from the Copa America with a 1-0 loss to Uruguay on Math\u00edas Olivera's questionable second-half goal Monday night, a defeat sure to increase pressure on the U.S. Soccer Federation to remove coach Gregg Berhalter before the 2026 World Cup.\n\nUruguay scored in the 66th minute when Nicolas De La Cruz swung a free kick in front of the U.S. goal. Matt Turner parried a header by Ronald Ara\u00fajo, who out-jumped defender Tim Ream, but the rebound went right to Mathias Olivera and he tapped the ball in with his left foot.\n\nOlivera appeared to be offside on the initial header but the goal stood after a video review.\n\nUsing a lineup of players entirely from European clubs, Berhalter and the U.S. hoped to show the team had advanced since its round-of-16 elimination against the Netherlands at the 2022 World Cup. Instead, the U.S. managed only a 2-0 win over lowly Bolivia and were upset 2-1 by Panama, putting it in a tough situation Monday night.\n\n\"We had a good start and brought a lot of energy but at the end of the day, just not enough quality,\" U.S. captain Christian Pulisic said. \"I felt like we gave it everything but we just couldn't score.\"",

Most members of the establishment cling to the idea that the principal worry about Republican policy views is the growing appeal of \"isolationism.\" A recent example was a Washington Post column by Marc A. Thiessen. Thiessen was responding to a speech by President Biden at the Normandy battlefield, and the exchange illustrated the utter sterility in America's current foreign policy debate.\n\nThiessen is annoyed because Biden had accused GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump of isolationism. Instead of pointing out that isolationism has long been a vacuous epithet used to discredit critics who want to move beyond the policies created during the Cold War, Thiessen's goal is quite different. It is to make the case that Trump is part of the Republican hawkish establishment: \"Biden's latest attack on Trump is wildly inaccurate.\" The essence of Thiessen's defense is that Trump is at least as hawkish as his more conventional Republican colleagues. He asserts, in essence, that \"Trump is as hawkish as we are.\" Thiessen heaps praise on the former president for Trump's hardline policies against Iran, including the assassination of General Quasem Soleimani.\n\nThiessen also points out that contrary to the mythology fostered by the Democrats that Trump was Vladimir Putin's puppet, Trump had launched cyber attacks against Russia and, unlike the Obama administration, had provided weapons to Ukraine. Echoing allegations by Mitch McConnell and other GOP congressional leaders, Thiessen contends that there are indeed isolationists in the Republican Party, most notably Senator J.D. Vance (R-Ohio). But, according to Thiessen, \"Trump's record suggests he is not the isolationist they hope him to be.\"\n\nLeaving aside Thiessen's silly isolationist epithet, he's likely correct that the foreign policy of a new Trump administration would differ little from the collection of obsolete assumptions and counterproductive policies that have plagued U.S. foreign policy for decades. For real, beneficial change in U.S. foreign policy, a new administration would need to recognize the actual conditions of the world in the 21 century and make necessary policy adjustments.\n\nThe Biden administration clearly is incapable of doing that. Its policies, both in the Middle East and in Europe, have been disastrous. Entangling the United States in the Russia-Ukraine war and serving as Israel's enabler for its brutal actions in Gaza are not effective or beneficial strategies for the American people.\n\nTo actually implement the strategy of \"Peace through Strength\" that Thiessen and so many other Republicans advocate requires fresh thinking on multiple fronts. It certainly requires going beyond the interventionist cliches that Thiessen and his colleagues embrace. Among other changes, it would require Washington to accept the reality that spheres of influence exist and will continue to exist in world affairs. Launching emotional crusades against Russia, Iran, and other major powers is precisely the dangerous, unrewarding approach that the U.S. must avoid. No longer confining America's foreign policy options to the kind of thinking embraced by Mark Thiessen or Joe Biden is an essential first step.\n\nThe sterility of the Biden faction's ideas is evident in multiple cases. Contrary to the expectations of many U.S. foreign policy experts, the Biden administration's policy toward the People's Republic of China (PRC) has been far more confrontational than anticipated. In fact, there is little difference in Washington's actions on either economic or strategic issues regarding China between the Trump and Biden years. In particular, Biden has continued Trump's buildup of U.S. security support for Taiwan. Moreover, the Biden administration has actually taken a harder line toward North Korea than Trump had adopted.\n\nThe United States is now in the ill-advised position of being on bad terms simultaneously with Moscow and Beijing. If productive policy change is to come, it will not likely take place with either Joe Biden or Donald Trump in the White House.",

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Clinches a $4.5B Contract for PAC-3 MSE Missiles",
        "body": "Per major news sources, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently secured a multi-year contract worth $4.5 billion for its Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target Advanced Capability-3 missile from the U.S. Army. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will procure 870 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (\"MSE\") missiles and associated hardware.\n\nGlobal geopolitical and socioeconomic unrest has led both developed and emerging nations to increase the size of their armaments, with missiles making up a large share of these arsenals. Consequently, leading missile manufacturers such as Lockheed are witnessing a solid contract flow for their combat-proven missiles and associated hardware. The latest contract win is evidence of it.\n\nSpecifically, Lockheed's Missiles and Fire Control division develops cutting-edge combat missiles for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and several international allies of the United States. LMT's PAC-3 is a missile that is highly sophisticated and can protect against advanced threats, such as airplanes, cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles and tactical ballistic missiles.\n\nIn light of this, it is essential to note that 15 partner nations of the United States are currently using the PAC-3 family of missiles, with Lockheed having manufactured 17,000 PAC-3 MSEs so far. This undoubtedly illustrates the strong demand PAC-3 enjoys in the global missile industry.\n\nWith the ongoing hostilities in various regions of the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war, which has been going on for more than two years, the global peace index indicates an unstable environment. As a result, the demand for military weapons -- especially missiles -- has increased in the defense industry as countries attempt to defend their borders from previously unheard-of attacks.\n\nConsequently, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the global missiles and missiles defense system market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period. Such growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market should bode well for Lockheed, which is a prominent missile manufacturer.\n\nA PAC-3 MSE interceptor was launched by Lockheed in May 2024 from an MK-70 containerized launch vehicle to intercept a cruise missile target in flight, a notable move to expand the PAC-3 missile's market reach. With the help of the Virtualized Aegis Weapon System, PAC-3 MSE was deployed in this configuration for the first time to intercept a live target. It is anticipated that these modernization initiatives, along with the rising demand for missiles, will result in further PAC-3 missile contract wins, which will improve LMT's top line.\n\nAs global threats continue to rise, apart from LMT, defense contractors that are likely to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the missiles and missile defense system market are as follows:\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It creates and manufactures warheads, fuses, sophisticated high-speed propulsion systems and other missile components. The company is one of the top suppliers of solid rocket propulsion for air-launched missiles, interceptors, submarine-launched weapons and hypersonic missile systems.\n\nNorthrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC's 2024 sales suggests growth of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nRTX Corp RTX: It offers a variety of combat-proven missile defense systems, including the Patriot missile, Standard Missiles, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, Evolved Seasparrow Missiles, the Tomahawk cruise missile and a few more. To keep up with its growing demand for a wide variety of missiles, RTX broke ground with a $115 million worth, 26,000-square-foot expansion of its Redstone Raytheon Missile Integration Facility in April 2024.\n\nRTX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales implies an improvement of 6.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nThe Boeing Company BA: For almost 25 years, Boeing has been providing the United States, its allies and international partners with air and missile defense systems. The Avenger Air Defense System, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense and a few additional missiles are among its product offerings.\n\nBA boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 25.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales suggests an improvement of 0.9% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nIn the past six months, shares of Lockheed have risen 3.1% against the industry's decline of 10.2%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLockheed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "NATO offers Ukraine a new HQ in Germany - a \"bridge\" to Kyiv's eventual membership   - NaturalNews.com",
        "body": "Officials from NATO and the U.S. confirmed the move, adding that the headquarters will be formally announced at the group's upcoming 75th anniversary summit, to be held in Washington, D.C. from July 9 to July 11. The mission will be known as the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) and will work to \"reduce duplications and complications from the various kinds of weaponry sent to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to DNYUZ, the NSATU will be based at a U.S. military facility in the city of Wiesbaden in Germany's Hesse state. It will be headed by a three-star general - likely an American - reporting to Gen. Christopher Cavoli, the head of the U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe.\n\nNSATU will bring under one umbrella the activities of the current \"capabilities coalition\" of countries that provide various aspects of military aid to Ukraine like air defenses, artillery, F-16 fighter jets, arms and training. The U.S. and NATO officials who spoke on condition of anonymity added that the NSATU will also coordinate the training of Ukrainian military personnel in allied countries and the longer-term bilateral security agreements that different countries have signed with Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO Ivo Daalder explained that putting the NSATU under Cavoli's NATO hat will protect it from any political change in Washington. Because the mission will be under NATO's auspices, it is designed to function even if former U.S. President Donald Trump wins the November presidential elections and returns to the White House.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

But U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that NATO's 75th anniversary summit would show that allies are taking \"concrete steps\" to bring Ukraine closer. He added that it would also ensure that Kyiv has a \"bridge to eventual membership.\"\n\nAccording to DNYUZ, the Biden administration and NATO officials came up with the idea as a way to give something solid to Kyiv at the summit - even as they maintain the time is not right for Ukraine to join. The hope is that the mission and the commitment it represents will satisfy Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and lead to a smoother summit. (Related: The outcome of Ukraine's war with Russia will determine whether it achieves NATO membership.)\n\nLast year, Zelensky and other Central European nations fervently hoped that NATO would offer Ukraine membership negotiations during the 2023 NATO summit held in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. But the alliance refused to offer Ukraine a fixed timeline and clear path to membership or to allow negotiations on membership to begin, driving Zelensky to voice out his displeasure.\n\nAll NATO member countries are on board the NSATU's establishment. However, according to Daalder, Germany objected to calling it a \"mission\" to avoid the implication that NATO was at war with Russia. While the group has yet to declare war with Moscow, its assistance of Ukraine makes it a party to the conflict.\n\nOutgoing NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg vaguely touched on the NSATU initiative at a June 14 news conference, which followed a meeting of NATO defense ministers on the same day. He called the new mission a \"key summit deliverable\" and a further step \"on Ukraine's path to NATO membership.\"\n\nStoltenberg reiterated that the initiative would \"put our support to Ukraine on a firmer footing for years to come.\" He added: \"These efforts do not make NATO a party to the conflict, but they will enhance our support to Ukraine to uphold its right to self-defense.\"\n\nBut ultimately, the NSATU will surely infuriate Russia and further derail potential peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has imposed two requirements before talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war could begin - Ukraine must pull out all its troops in territories annexed by Russia and must abandon its intent to join NATO.\n\nListen to the Health Ranger Mike Adams explaining that the U.S. and NATO have already decided to take the American people to war below.\n\nU.S., Ukraine sign 10-year bilateral security agreement backed by nothing.\n\nNATO to overstep Russia's red line as it mulls sending troops to train Ukrainian armed forces.",

        "title": "Doug Burgum Is a Neocon",
        "body": "The selection of the North Dakota governor would be a cavalier choice on the issue of greatest presidential power: foreign policy.\n\nIt's July. In the coming days, the Republican presidential ticket will finalize, even as the Democratic ticket could evaporate.\n\nThe former President Donald Trump is meditating on a raft of main choices -- among them Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and Senator J.D. Vance (R-OH). One contender of a previously lower profile, however, has evolved from dark horse to an apparent favorite in the sweepstakes. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum is seen by his adherents as a well-suited, no-nonsense deputy for the second Trump tour of duty.\n\nSquint and you can see the case: younger, but not too much younger (at 67, Burgum will not overshadow Trump with youthful panache). He has a business record (he sold a software company to Microsoft in the Clinton-era tech craze). A non-factor rival for the nomination last year, Burgum is said to get on with the presumptive Republican nominee. Burgum's wife is a recovering alcoholic -- a point of sympathy from the ex-president who blames his brother Fred's premature demise on the bottle.\n\nMany are hoping that a second Trump term would be a bespoke version of the first. Populists clamor for a more tough-minded focus on the issues -- foreign policy restraint, trade realism and migration sanity -- that helped make Trump the most powerful man in the world.\n\nThe selection of Burgum would indeed be vintage -- but not in an inspired way.\n\nFor instance, Burgum has stated the U.S. is literally \"at war\" with Russia and appeared to leave the door open to future deployment of American troops. In one video interview, Burgum stated, \"We're in a cold war with China, and we're actually at war with Russia-we just haven't sent troops yet. We're sending material, we're sending funding, we're sending advisors.\"\n\nIt's not just Eurasia that Burgum wants troops, but also that old standby: the Middle East. Burgum has been open to placing American troops in the maelstrom of the Israel-Gaza war. \"Absolutely,\" Burgum told voters in 2023.\n\nBurgum has said U.S. funding for the war in Ukraine, which now totals nearly $200 billion, is \"a bargain\" and was only \"a little bit\" of money -- he also rejected that the spending was \"irresponsible.\" Burgum also suggested Ukraine should not cede any territory to Russia in peace negotiations, comparing that possible outcome to the cessation of the Korean War.\n\n(In fairness, that is not the most irresponsible analogy. Indeed, Washington may eventually have to assent to an armistice that its disputatious and radicalized ally government, led by Volodoymr Zelsensky, absents itself from. This was the case in Korea, with Syngman Rhee, who was committed to the war to the last American. But back in reality, full territorial restoration of Ukraine is out of the question, and such a stance could make the war permanent.)\n\nWhile perhaps no John Bolton, Burgum is many ways more the archetype of the sort of regrettable selection at the commanding heights that Trump made in his first term. In other words, Burgum is Rex Tillerson, except that he ran North Dakota and a vassal company of Microsoft, and not the most powerful American oil company since the age of Rockefeller.\n\n(In a rather rib-tickling aside, Burgum has called Iran the \"parent company\" of Hamas, implying openness to a wider Middle East war. He appears to speak from some experience.)\n\nBurgum has expressed his support for further funding for Ukraine, echoing President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's talking points that an endless war is somehow connected to competition with China, and even North Korea for good measure. Burgum appears to fear an axis of evil, a grandiose and discredited view of the non-American world, though he won't call it that.\n\n\"I support us making sure that Putin does not get a win in Ukraine...if we don't defeat Putin it's just basically handing another win to China,\" Burgum has commented. \"You can't say 'Oh, China's our existential threat, but let's not send money to Russia,' Russia and China are absolutely connected and throw in North Korea, who's been meeting both with China and Russia....\"\n\nAt last Thursday's prize-winning debate against Biden, Trump told the nation he would broker the end of the Russia-Ukraine war as president-elect. It was a callback to the kind of fast action pledged by Ronald Reagan in 1980 during the Iran crisis, and Richard Nixon amid the Vietnam War.\n\nBurgum's record suggests he would be a hindrance to such an endeavor. Not in an overt way, a la Bolton. But in a way that is in some ways more familiar, and odious.\n\nBurgum's record is establishmentarian to the core on the issue of greatest presidential power: foreign policy. It's not clear that there is much daylight between Burgum and a figure such as Mike Pompeo, for instance, the former secretary of State who stumped for Trump rival Glenn Youngkin as he considered a presidential bid last year and a person the 45th president is said to have soured on.\n\nMost distressing: Burgum could help deprioritize the Trumpist signature issue of immigration as vice president, just as the public is coming around to realism on migration.\n\nBurgum also refused to prioritize border funding over Ukraine funding, rejecting demands of reformers in Congress. \"The idea that some people are saying: 'Oh, we shouldn't send money to Ukraine because we need to spend it on our own border.' Actually, America can do both of those things at the same time.... We can help Ukraine beat Russia and we can secure our own border at the same time,\" Burgum told Forbes in 2023.\n\nIt goes on.\n\nIn a town hall with New Hampshire voters, Burgum said he thought \"our obligations to Western Europe are significant,\" adding \"Ukraine is actually doing the work of NATO\" by fighting Russia. And Burgum's campaign website still lists two \"common enemies\" under the national security policy section, adding the U.S. should somehow unite against them: \"China and Putin.\"\n\nMany have long postulated Trump might attempt a \"reverse\" Nixon strategy -- get tough with China and get real with Russia. Burgum apparently thinks Trump should not even try.\n\nThere is a rich history on what actually constitutes a \"neocon.\" Some have argued that George W. Bush luminaries Bolton, Donald Rumsfeld, and Dick Cheney were not neoconservatives -- even in the arch-neocon administration. The argument is that they were conservative ultra-nationalists and militarists, in favor of manifold conflicts, but averse to nation-building. This tendency is contrasted with other Bushies like Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, and Doug Feith.\n\nAs the late historian Mark Perry observed in \"Talking To Terrorists\": \"Wolfowitz was completely different. He was haunted by the slaughter of the Shias in the aftermath of the first Gulf War as America sat on its hands. It kept him awake nights.\" But as Jacob Heilbrunn, editor of the National Interest, observed in his treatise They Knew They Were Right: The Rise of the Neocons, at a certain point you can slice and dice the matter to the point that there are no gentile neocons.\n\nWhile fun to riff on, it is a distinction without a difference.\n\nThe true rift in American national security debate is between cocksure primacy and chastened restraint. Either you believe the last quarter century of American foreign policy has been ruinous, or you seek to double down. Whatever his other virtues, Doug Burgum would be another neoconservative in power.",

        "body": "Summary and Key Points: The recent Bayou Warrior military exercise at Barksdale Air Force Base involved the deployment of live missiles by the U.S. Air Force's B-52H fleet.\n\n-This exercise reflects the increasing global military tensions reminiscent of pre-World War I maneuvers. The U.S. military, under financial and logistical strains, is training intensely to prepare for potential conflicts with near-peer adversaries like China and Russia.\n\n-Despite these efforts, significant concerns remain about the readiness and current doctrines of the U.S. military, suggesting a need for new strategic thinking and leadership to navigate the evolving geopolitical landscape.\n\nA recent military exercise at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana saw the base's B-52H fleet deploying \"live missiles\" in what the Air Force referred to as a \"readiness exercise\" dubbed Bayou Warrior.\n\nThe exercise was intended to be real-world training for a U.S. military that is increasingly under threat from multiple powers - some of them, such as China and Russia, that are considered to be nearly equal in capabilities to the United States.\n\nOn the eve of the First World War, the conflict that basically broke the 20th century and obliterated the centuries-long European-led world order, the great powers of that era jockeyed for power.\n\nAs part of these maneuvers, the European great powers attempted to undermine each other at every turn in the run-up to war. One of the ways they did that was by endless military exercises. Over time, these exercises got more complex, and added to the sense that a great war was coming.\n\nThe Bayou Warrior exercises at Barksdale were similar to those exercises as the militaries of the world today are jockeying against one another in ways not seen in decades. During the exercise, the Air Force trained with live missiles.\n\nLaunching live missiles is a costly move, and exercises like this in the 1990s and even the early 2000s were few and far between.\n\nAmerica's largest bomber wing, the 2nd Bomb Wing, is located at Barksdale. One official description of the exercise stated that the exercise was meant to \"generate, load, and deliver conventional weapons in a simulated environment.\" The entire point of the exercise, according to U.S. Air Force Col. Bryan J. Walter, the CO of the 2nd Operations Group said, \"[The Air Force inspector general's office] will come in, and they're going to give you a hard look at, 'Are you ready to go?'\"\n\nThis exercise was meant to test the Air Force's strategic readiness for potential long-range strike missions, which is why they used live munitions. The only reason the Air Force would be doing this is because the fear is real that a war with a near-peer competitor could happen.\n\nAt a time when the U.S. military is cash-strapped (despite having a combined budget of nearly $1 trillion), the Air Force is spending millions of dollars preparing its personnel for a real-world conflict. Of course, training is something all militaries do. And training in as close of an approximation to real-world conditions is the best way to ready one's military to be dominant.\n\nYet the nature of this particular training exercise, the kind of equipment involved, its scope, and the way in which the results of this exercise will be deployed across the wider force are what really matter.\n\nWe are, as I have written repeatedly both in these pages and elsewhere, on the brink of WWIII. What's more, the U.S. military is the least prepared for such a conflict. Multiple sources over the years have indicated that the military is the weakest it has been since the interwar years.\n\nThese sources are likely correct. There is a recruitment crisis. America's military equipment is worn down after 20 years of endless Mideast warfare. Our doctrines are no longer prepared for the kind of great power conflict we face today. The funding of the military is mismanaged. And America's defense industrial base is hopelessly depleted.\n\nThat's to say nothing of the nature of America's political leadership, which for many years has left much to be desired.\n\nThese increasingly assertive exercises are meant to signal U.S. military capabilities to American foes while giving the force much-needed real-world training. But these exercises are insufficient. Under current circumstances, the U.S. military will lose a war against China if that war erupts anywhere along what's known as the First Island Chain.\n\nThe United States, via NATO and Ukraine, is checkmated by Russia in the Ukraine War. It's obvious that Washington wants to avoid a wider Middle East war, as the situation between Israel and Iran reaches crisis levels.\n\nThe U.S. military cannot even effectively deter the Houthi rebels in Yemen, with their significant and growing anti-ship weapons capability. Meanwhile, Russian warships lurk off the coast of Florida, likely preparing to help Venezuela in its bid to conquer its oil rich neighbor of Guyana.\n\nSo, the U.S. military is doing what it knows how to do: It drills according to its best laid plans. But those plans were written in a bygone era. What's needed is an entirely new understanding of the geopolitical situation coupled with the kind of visionary leadership that can avoid the likes of a third world war that will destroy whatever is left of American power.\n\nFollowing plans that no longer reflect the geopolitical reality we now live in is a very dangerous thing to do indeed.\n\nBrandon J.

        "title": "Lockheed (LMT) Clinches a $4.5B Contract for PAC-3 MSE Missiles",
        "body": "Per major news sources, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT recently secured a multi-year contract worth $4.5 billion for its Phased Array Tracking to Intercept of Target Advanced Capability-3 missile from the U.S. Army. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will procure 870 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (\"MSE\") missiles and associated hardware.\n\nWhat's Favoring Lockheed?\n\nGlobal geopolitical and socioeconomic unrest has led both developed and emerging nations to increase the size of their armaments, with missiles making up a large share of these arsenals. Consequently, leading missile manufacturers such as Lockheed are witnessing a solid contract flow for their combat-proven missiles and associated hardware. The latest contract win is evidence of it.\n\nSpecifically, Lockheed's Missiles and Fire Control division develops cutting-edge combat missiles for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and several international allies of the United States. LMT's PAC-3 is a missile that is highly sophisticated and can protect against advanced threats, such as airplanes, cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles and tactical ballistic missiles.\n\nIn light of this, it is essential to note that 15 partner nations of the United States are currently using the PAC-3 family of missiles, with Lockheed having manufactured 17,000 PAC-3 MSEs so far. This undoubtedly illustrates the strong demand PAC-3 enjoys in the global missile industry.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nWith the ongoing hostilities in various regions of the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war, which has been going on for more than two years, the global peace index indicates an unstable environment. As a result, the demand for military weapons -- especially missiles -- has increased in the defense industry as countries attempt to defend their borders from previously unheard-of attacks.\n\nConsequently, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the global missiles and missiles defense system market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period. Such growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market should bode well for Lockheed, which is a prominent missile manufacturer.\n\nA PAC-3 MSE interceptor was launched by Lockheed in May 2024 from an MK-70 containerized launch vehicle to intercept a cruise missile target in flight, a notable move to expand the PAC-3 missile's market reach. With the help of the Virtualized Aegis Weapon System, PAC-3 MSE was deployed in this configuration for the first time to intercept a live target. It is anticipated that these modernization initiatives, along with the rising demand for missiles, will result in further PAC-3 missile contract wins, which will improve LMT's top line.\n\nPeer Prospects\n\nAs global threats continue to rise, apart from LMT, defense contractors that are likely to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the missiles and missile defense system market are as follows:\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It creates and manufactures warheads, fuses, sophisticated high-speed propulsion systems and other missile components. The company is one of the top suppliers of solid rocket propulsion for air-launched missiles, interceptors, submarine-launched weapons and hypersonic missile systems.\n\nNorthrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC's 2024 sales suggests growth of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nRTX Corp RTX: It offers a variety of combat-proven missile defense systems, including the Patriot missile, Standard Missiles, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles, Evolved Seasparrow Missiles, the Tomahawk cruise missile and a few more. To keep up with its growing demand for a wide variety of missiles, RTX broke ground with a $115 million worth, 26,000-square-foot expansion of its Redstone Raytheon Missile Integration Facility in April 2024.\n\nRTX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales implies an improvement of 6.2% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nThe Boeing Company BA: For almost 25 years, Boeing has been providing the United States, its allies and international partners with air and missile defense systems. The Avenger Air Defense System, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense and a few additional missiles are among its product offerings.\n\nBA boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 25.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales suggests an improvement of 0.9% from the 2023 reported figure.\n\nLockheed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "body": "CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand -- Travis Reddy wants to buy a Brazilian weapons manufacturer.\n\nAs the CEO of DefendTex, an Australian firm specializing in precision-guided weapons, rockets and loitering munitions, he's encouraged by a government-run program aimed at growing the domestic industry's capability to build long-range weaponry. The problem, though, is he can't get the financial backing expected from the Australian government's Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise program.\n\nInstead, large defense contractors, especially those hailing from overseas, are receiving preferential treatment, according to a local analyst.\n\n\"There's a tendency by government to default to the primes. Everything must go through Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Thales or whatever. Let's see what SMEs [small and medium enterprises] can do in terms of things like long-range missiles,\" said Malcolm Davis, an expert in capability development and military technology at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. \"Give them a chance to actually demonstrate their capabilities.\"\n\nFor months, DefendTex has been asking Export Finance Australia -- the government's export credit agency -- for a yearlong AU$70 million (U.S. $46 million) loan to acquire cash-strapped Avibras in Brazil. Reddy said he's depending on the government to assist, noting that domestic banks have refused to provide him a loan as a weapons manufacturer.\n\nDefendTex's exclusive negotiation period with Avibras has reportedly expired, as the timetable was to last until the end of June. Already the Chinese defense industry giant NORINCO is taking steps to buy the business. To sweeten the deal, NORINCO has expressed a willingness to manufacture Chinese weapons in Brazil.\n\nBut Reddy said Australia could benefit from Avibras' extensive experience with guided weapons, gain intellectual property and quickly replicate manufacturing facilities on Australian soil. \"We know that within 24 months we'd achieve full-rate production in Australia: the full IP suite, the seeker, propulsion system, the whole box and dice.\"\n\nReferring to mounting geopolitical tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, Davis highlighted the government's slow response time with endeavors like the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) Enterprise.\n\n\"At the moment it seems to be moving very much at a snail's pace on a small scale, a very hesitant approach on the part of government, which I don't understand given the very adverse strategic outlook we're facing,\" he said.\n\nThe GWEO Enterprise program is the government's official vehicle to develop a sovereign capability for producing long-range strike weapons. It currently boasts about 900 personnel and was formally created in May 2023 when Air Marshal Leon Phillips was appointed its inaugural chief.\n\n\"The GWEO group was established to accelerate the development of a guided weapons and explosive ordnance manufacturing industry in Australia,\" Phillips told Defense News.\n\nHe outlined the enterprise's two main functions: to establish a manufacturing industry, and to manage the acquisition, sustainment and support of weapons. According to the Defence Department's website, the government is spending $4.1 billion to increasingly buy long-range strike systems and locally manufacture longer-range munitions.\n\nHowever, Reddy said the program's lean toward American defense companies is hindering plans like his.\n\nIndeed, the government has appointed the Australian arms of the American firms RTX and Lockheed Martin as GWEO's strategic partners.\n\n\"The strategic partners and their U.S. parent companies are working with [the Department of] Defence to explore opportunities for greater partnerships and, to this end, are developing detailed, costed plans for manufacturing guided weapons and their components in Australia,\" Phillips said.\n\nThe department has said it will consider those \"costed plans\" in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\"Support and assistance from the U.S. is critical to the success of the GWEO Enterprise. At the Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations in July 2023, the principals agreed to deepen cooperation on Australia's GWEO Enterprise by collaborating on a flexible guided-weapons production capability in Australia. This cooperation is underway, and an initial batch of GMLRS [Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System] missiles will be manufactured in Australia by 2025,\" Phillips added, referring to a AU$37.4 million contract for Lockheed Martin Australia, announced in January 2024.\n\nJames Heading, the director of programs at the Strategic Capabilities Office within Lockheed Martin Australia's missiles and fire control division, said further developing industry is critical and that GMLRS is a good starting point for the country. International demand for GMLRS is growing, especially in Ukraine amid its war with Russia.\n\n\"That doesn't necessarily mean everything's manufactured in Australia,\" Heading added. For example, he noted, it might be five to 10 years before Australian industry can unilaterally build missile seekers for the GMLRS.\n\nTenders for GMLRS production-related requirements in Australia close around the June-July time frame this year, which will lead to the assembly of GMLRS kits starting next year at the munitions storage base Defence Establishment Orchard Hills in Sydney. What will follow is the gradual introduction of domestically assembled components, before ramping up quantities, Heading said.\n\nTo be clear, Reddy said, he doesn't take issue with the Lockheed deal, but does think the government needs a backup plan.\n\n\"I'm not saying don't do GMLRS, don't do HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System]. Do all of that and preserve 5% of your budget [for] a plan B,\" he said, referring to government funding to support domestic industry acquisitions. \"That would be the pragmatic approach to ensuring we get the best of both worlds. So if the world goes to hell in a handbasket tomorrow, we've got something we can respond with.\"\n\nHe argued that the purchase of Avibras would be a \"very cheap\" insurance policy that does not detract from any long-term plans dependent on American firms.\n\nDavis agreed that there isn't a clear path from the Lockheed deal that would lead to more locally made, sophisticated capabilities. \"I think it's taken an inordinately long time to actually make any progress, and we're only talking about assembling GMLRS components here in Australia in 2025.\"\n\nHe said the government should encourage industry to pursue the local production of longer-range weapons like the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, the extended-range variant of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, and the Tomahawk cruise missile -- all of which are made by American businesses.\n\nBut the GWEO Enterprise isn't just about American-made weapons. For example, the Spike missile by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and the Naval Strike Missile by Norway's Kongsberg are both candidates for domestic production.\n\n\"GWEO is really about giving industry the opportunity to participate,\" Heading said, noting gaps in Australia's defense industry are due to capacity rather than ability.\n\nTo overcome these issues, Davis suggested the government further prioritize the GWEO program as well as incorporate lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\"We should actually be looking at how can we, ourselves, develop the long-range strike capabilities that can support the needs of the ADF [Australian Defence Force], the needs of our allies and partners, and offer us an export capability as well,\" he urged. \"Once again, there seems to be this lack of boldness and vision on the part of the government just to even think beyond the most minimalist application of GWEO in the near term.\n\n\"I don't understand why their perception of GWEO is so constrained and so limited.\"\n\nPart of the problem is Australia's peacetime mindset, Davis said.\n\n\"We assume that nothing bad will happen in this decade, and that we've got 10 years to wait. Ironically, we've said in past defense whitepapers that we no longer have 10 years of strategic warning, but that mindset of 10-year strategic warning time is still pervasive in the defense organization and within government,\" he explained.\n\n\"There needs to be recognition that we might have two, maybe three years to prepare for a major war,\" he added. \"So what can we do in the next two to three years in terms of mass production of capabilities? That's going to take some risks, it's going to take a bit of vision.\n\n\"My concern is that those decisions won't be made and we'll end up going into a next war in 2027 or 2028 with what we've got -- and not much to show for GWEO.\"\n\nTo be sure, the program hasn't been idle, Philips said, noting several major achievements to date, including upgrades to infrastructure and technology at the government-owned Mulwala and Benalla munitions factories operated by Thales Australia; remediation of the Port Wilson wharf to enable large-scale imports and exports of weapons; commissioned construction of additional storage and distribution infrastructure; and domestic production of 500-pound BLU-111 bombs.\n\nIn addition to the GMLRS contract, Phillips also pointed to accelerated acquisitions of Tomahawks, JASSM-ERs, Naval Strike Missiles and sea mines from overseas.\n\nBut these foreign purchases by the government don't help with situations like Reddy's.\n\n\"They're not taking any steps to develop a domestic, sovereign alternative to the kind of weapons they need,\" he said. \"In the event of high-intensity conflict, will Australia as a nation have the ability to manufacture the ordnance that it needs to keep the Australian Defence Force capable of conducting its mission? The overwhelming answer is no.\"",

        "summary": "Australia is aiming to boost its local arms production through the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) Enterprise program, but the initiative is currently favoring large foreign defense contractors over domestic firms. Travis Reddy, CEO of Australian company DefendTex, has struggled to secure government financial backing to acquire Brazilian weapons manufacturer Avibras, while foreign companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing receive preferential treatment. The GWEO program, established to develop a sovereign capability for long-range strike weapons, is moving slowly and heavily relies on American firms, which critics argue limits the development of local industry. Despite some progress, such as infrastructure upgrades and contracts for missile production, experts like Malcolm Davis from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute believe the government needs to be more proactive and bold in supporting domestic capabilities to prepare for potential geopolitical conflicts.",

        "body": "Even with 21% of the fleet parked, freighters will continue hauling a large share of global airfreight as the growth in bellyhold capacity slows, according to Tom Crabtree, MD of air cargo research and consulting firm Transport Research Advisory.\n\n\"All major tradelanes appear to be heading towards recovery in the first half,\" he said, pointing to a combination of strong e-commerce volumes and the disruption of ocean transport by the Red Sea crisis fuelling sea-air traffic.\n\nContainer capacity has been stretched by demand and the longer routings to avoid the Red Sea, resulting in extended transits reducing available capacity. And the differential between air and ocean cargo rates has dropped significantly in recent months.\n\nAirfreight capacity expansion has been driven by the recovery of passenger networks, producing a string of double-digit increases year on year, but the momentum has slowed, a trend Mr Crabtree expects to continue.\n\n\"Cargo space via belly capacity will continue to slow for the rest of 2024,\" he predicted.\n\nPassenger networks are more or less back to pre-Covid levels, except in the transpacific arena, notably on US-China. This is less a result of Covid, more the Russia-Ukraine war, which has closed Russian airspace to North American airlines, Mr Crabtree pointed out.\n\nUS airlines have successfully lobbied Washington to keep traffic rights to Chinese carriers at a diminished level while they enjoy an advantage in stage length and fuel burn. This has been a big factor behind the dominance of freighters in the transpacific arena.\n\nWhereas overall global airfreight traffic, as well as flows between the major regions, has seen the market share commanded by freighters slip from its 2021 level, it has actually expanded in the Asia-North America sector, from 82% in Q4 21 to 90% in Q4 23.\n\nEven the full restoration of passenger networks will not push the share of global traffic moving on freighter aircraft below the 50% mark, Mr Crabtree believes. In the final quarter of 2023, freighters carried 59% of global air cargo.\n\nIronically, the large widebody freighter fleet, which carries the lion's share of freight moved on all-cargo aircraft, has grown at a slow pace. Since 2013 it has expanded by about 140 units, he noted.\n\nMoreover, a large chunk, 21%, of the global fleet is currently parked - at the end of May, 602 freighter aircraft were stored, he pointed out. The bulk of the fleet reductions were in the narrowbody segment, with 348 aircraft out of service, accounting for 58% of freighters stored, while medium-sized (132) and widebodies (122) make up 22% and 20%, respectively.\n\nThe cull in active narrobody capacity (to which Mr Crabtree attributes, to a large extent, aircraft leasing firms having over-subscribed to e-commerce growth) has made a relatively minor dent in global maindeck capacity, as this segment generates a little over 10% of lift. Large widebodies make up 60-70%, while the contribution of medium widebody freighters is around 20%.\n\nAt the end of last year, 657 large widebody freighters were in service: 45% were B747s; 40% B777s; and 13% MD-11s;, with the remaining 2% being AN-124 and IL-96s.\n\nOver the past 18 months, the biggest reduction in this segment has played out in the MD-11 arena, which shrank from 111 units to 69, a drop of 38%. More will follow, as FedEx - one of the three remaining significant MD-11 operators - has announced plans to shrink its fleet further.\n\nThe global B747 fleet shrank by 11 (4%) in the past 18 months. The aircraft is still popular, but there have been indications that maintenance support for the 747-400 has become less readily available. Mr Crabtree said production models were still very much sought after, however, because of their nose door - but for operators of converted units, ultimately it would make sense to shift to large twin-engine freighters, he said.\n\n\"We are on the cusp of a major change in the large widebody segment,\" he added, noting that Boeing and Airbus had so far garnered 55 orders each for their planned 777-8F and A350 cargo planes.",

        "body": "Penny stocks are risky and are known for crashing and burning fast. Most of these stocks are unstable and attract a lot of speculations and shifts in the market.\n\nBut for those who don't mind the risk, there are some great gems among thousands of subpar penny stocks to buy that can be a strategic investment strategy.\n\nThese three penny stocks have performed tremendously in the past couple of weeks and, for keen analysts, are poised to outperform market expectations. The performance of these penny stocks is favored by the prevailing market, political, technological and economic conditions that guarantee their upward movement in the foreseeable future.\n\nNow, let's cover why these are the smartest penny stocks to buy right now, what industry trends prop them and what Wall Street analysts think of their future performance.\n\nVAALCO Energy (NYSE:EGY) is a fast-rising Texas-based oil and gas company operating in West and North Africa and parts of North America. The company has seen tremendous growth over the last couple of years as Russia-Ukraine war triggered a global oil supply shortage and a sharp demand incline.\n\nThe company has ramped up its production since 2022, witnessing a YOY growth of 20% in 2023 and reporting a revenue jump of 25% in its most recent quarterly earnings report. With a current yield of about 3.99% and its earnings per sharing topping at seven cents per share in 2024 from two cents in 2022, VAALCO Energy proves to be one of the best penny stocks to buy right now.\n\nAlthough it has recently graduated from a penny stock by surpassing $5, it is quite an affordable deal to ignore. And with almost three Waltsreet analysts offering a 12-month average price forecast of $8.92, you should consider placing your money on this one.\n\nVAALCO Energy is set to thrive, with the prevailing geopolitical conditions seeing a shift from Russian oil to Western-produced energy, the company has a real potential to thrive.\n\nThe recent acquisition of Svenska Petroleum Exploration has also seen an increase in the company's production capacity, and ability to meet the increasing demand for Westen energy.\n\nSoundHound AI, Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) is an AI-enabled voice and speech recognition company investing in providing personalized customer experience across all industries. The company provides an AI-powered technology that trains in natural language, understanding which enables companies to utilize the existing data, as well as automate personalized responses to customers.\n\nSound Hound's penny stocks have been one of the hottest in the market for the past year, surging over 89% YTD. The company has also seen an astounding Q1 sales revenue increase of over 73%, hitting a record 11.9 million, surpassing market estimates by $1.49 million.\n\nWith the company's shares now trading just under $4, the projected tech trends favor tremendous growth and expansion of its operations. With AI titans such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) throwing their weight behind the company and almost all industries accepting AI to improve customer service, SoundHound AI has a real potential to grow.\n\nNeXalin Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:NXL) is a fast-rising pharmaceutical technology company investing in technologies to treat mental health conditions. The company's transcranial alternating current stimulation technology utilizes a non-invasive treatment method that uses a patented frequency waveform to stimulate a positive response in the patient's brain.\n\nThe company has witnessed tremendous growth since this new technology was approved by the FDA. While NeXalin's stock trades at just above $2, it is the most bullish penny stock to buy right now.\n\nRecently, it secured a patent for Alzheimer's deep-brain stimulation device, a non-invasion treatment procedure that will revolutionize the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. While the announcement came with an almost 50% surge in the company's stock prices, the company has the potential to grow, having developed a strategic lead in the non-invasive brain treatment technology. NeXalin is definitely one of the most promising penny stocks to buy this year.",

        "summary": "The global hydrogen storage market is projected to grow from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $7.7 billion by 2028, at a CAGR of 7.6%, driven by advances in materials and technologies, according to a BCC Research study. Key factors fueling this growth include the increasing use of electrolyzers for grid stabilization, rising demand for sustainable and low-emission fuels, and the development of hydrogen infrastructure. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to dominate the market due to its extensive automobile industry and focus on sustainable fuels. The chemical industry and physical storage segments are anticipated to lead by 2028. Major players in the market include Air Liquide, Chart Industries, and Linde PLC. The report also highlights the competitive landscape and the importance of carbon emissions reduction initiatives.",

        "body": "Despite the brutality of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, support or sympathy toward Russia is shown by some actors on the international stage. This could be attributed to the multi-facet information warfare conducted by Russia and its strategic partner China. However, the analysis of information warfare during the current war remains scattered. This article, therefore, adopts a documentary analysis of relevant documents and media sources to conceptualize the forms of information warfare used by these two countries to contribute to future studies. It then proceeds to discuss that the Russia-Ukraine war implies a growing use of information warfare in present and future wars under digitalization. Facing a growing threat posed to people's cognitive understanding, the democratic community has to be aware of this increasingly dangerous military strategy and develop corresponding solutions. This article suggests that different societal stakeholders must collaborate to develop comprehensive education and thus strengthen digital citizenship. This is vital to nurturing people into critical and responsible citizens, thus equipping themselves with the resilience needed to combat information warfare.",

        "title": "It took a war for NATO members to actually take their obligations seriously with Biden at the helm",
        "body": "Despite President Joe Biden's claims that he helped strengthen NATO, a transatlantic alliance critically reliant on the U.S., it wasn't until a war broke out in Eastern Europe that alliance members started taking its defense spending commitments seriously.\n\nBiden has boasted on numerous occasions that he made NATO more powerful than former President Donald Trump did, helping to expand the alliance and restore its reputation on the global stage. But NATO members were spending less on defense under Biden until the Russia-Ukraine war broke out, prompting the alliance to finally increase spending, according to official alliance documents.\n\nBiden claimed during a debate against former President Donald Trump on Thursday that NATO was \"strong\" under his administration and bragged about how he got \"50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine,\" warning that Trump would pull out of the alliance if reelected.\n\nHis comments echo remarks made weeks and months earlier, in which he claimed his administration was responsible for NATO's success.\n\n\"Trump wants to eviscerate NATO. He thinks NATO is useless,\" Biden told Time in an interview in June. \"NATO is considerably stronger than it was when I took office. I put it together. Not only did I reestablish the fact that it was the strongest alliance in the history of the world, I was able to expand it.\"\n\n\"America is a founding member of NATO,\" Biden said during his State of the Union address in March. \"Today, we've made NATO stronger than ever.\"\n\nNATO members are currently spending more on defense than they have in the last decade. Members of NATO, including the U.K. Canada, and the European Union (EU) nations, are obligated to spend at least 2% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defense spending as part of their alliance agreement.\n\n\"I've worked really hard, spent hours and hours and hours doing this,\" Biden said on NATO in a May interview with Howard Stern, who thanked him for working on making the alliance stronger. \"And the idea that had we not gotten this done, I think you would've seen a beginning of disintegration of NATO.\"\n\nIt is expected that 23 of the 32 members will hit the 2% minimum in 2024, up from 10 members the year prior, according to NATO defense expenditures.\n\nThe jump in spending comes alongside the surging Russia-Ukraine war, which has engulfed Eastern Europe and concerned members that Moscow could target them next. Prior to and during the immediate aftermath of the Russia war, fewer NATO members were meeting their spending targets under Biden than they were under Trump.\n\nOnly seven NATO members hit their spending goals in 2022, up from six in 2021, according to alliance defense expenditures. In 2020, Trump's last full year in office, nine members were hitting their spending targets.\n\nTrump routinely pressured members of NATO to meet their defense spending goals during his tenure, threatening to pull the U.S. out of the alliance if they didn't. The number of NATO countries meeting their spending targets more than doubled from the start to the end of Trump's presidency, before dropping in 2021 once Biden took office, according to expenditures.\n\n\"The only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. I said, and he is right about this, I said, 'No, I'm not going to support NATO if you don't pay, I won't do that,\" Trump said during Thursday's debate. \"And you know what happened? Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months. But now, we're in the same position. We're paying everybody's bills.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

        "body": "After Thursday night's disastrous debate performance, the whole world sees what those who were paying attention have known for some time: The leader of the free world, President Joe Biden, is an empty chair. Mr. Biden no longer has the mental capacity or stamina to perceive events comprehensively and make decisions based on that perspective.\n\nAs a partisan Republican, I have strong reasons for not wanting to see Joe go. A weakened man is a weak candidate, and a weak candidate is a weak rival to my party's preferred alternative, Mr. Trump. But however the race goes, the United States only has one president at a time, and -- unless something is done -- until January 20, 2025, more than six long months away, that president is Joe Biden.\n\nJust focusing on foreign policy alone, Mr. Biden's empty-chair administration has been disastrous. When the president doesn't choose a policy, nobody else can choose for him. Instead, without guidance, each piece of the bureaucracy follows its own priorities and acts on its own agenda, even when those agendas make no sense when taken simultaneously.\n\nMost spectacularly, the administration hasn't chosen sides between Israel and Hamas but supports both sides in that terrible war, with money, with supplies, and with rhetoric. As Mr. Trump said in the debate, effectively, Mr. Biden \"has become like a Palestinian. But they don't like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\" A similar point applies to the Russia-Ukraine war, where the US has intervened to prevent a compromise peace but has not offered the aid that would enable Ukraine to win. And thanks to the combination of Russian aggression and American dithering, the world is closer to thermonuclear holocaust than it has ever been. That peril will not wait for the Electoral College.\n\nSo what can be done? The US Constitution offers two methods for shunting aside an unfit President before the end of his term. There is the complicated and untested mechanism of section 4 of the 25th Amendment: \"Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.\"\n\nBut that mechanism has never been used, much less the following provision: if the President contests the claim of incapacity, Congress should decide.\n\nThere is, however, a better way.\n\nIf the Democratic House and Senate leadership would put country and the fate of the world over party, go to the Republican leadership, and say \"this cannot go on,\" an impeachment in the House and trial and removal in the Senate could be done in a few days.\n\nTrue, in either case, the buck would stop with Vice President Harris, either as acting president or as the real thing, and many in and outside the Democrat Party do not see her as an effective chief executive. But she is at least smart and aware enough to hear the warring bureaucrats, choose a consistent policy, and, if ably served, make everybody work for its success. Like any President, Ms. Harris might make a wrong decision, but she would at least decide.\n\nSo what will it be, Senate Majority Leader Schumer? Will you go to the Republican House and Senate leadership and offer to work together to put an actual President behind the Resolute desk, even if that means undermining your nominal President and embarrassing your party? Or will you do nothing and hope that the ship of state remains afloat despite the stormy waters, the looming rocks, and the senile captain?\n\n\"Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?\"",

        "summary": "The article from \"American Greatness\" criticizes President Joe Biden's performance, particularly highlighting his perceived lack of mental capacity and stamina, which was evident during a recent debate. The author, a partisan Republican, argues that Biden's inability to make decisive policies has led to chaotic foreign policy, notably in the Israel-Hamas conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war. The article suggests that Biden's indecisiveness has brought the world closer to nuclear conflict.\n\nThe author proposes two constitutional methods to address Biden's perceived incapacity: invoking the 25th Amendment or impeachment. The 25th Amendment allows the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to declare the President unfit, but this process is complex and untested. Alternatively, the author suggests that bipartisan cooperation between Democratic and Republican leaders could lead to a swift impeachment and removal of Biden.\n\nThe article concludes by urging Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to prioritize the country's well-being over party loyalty and work with Republicans to replace Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris, who, despite criticisms, is seen as more capable of making decisions.",

        "title": "SEP member R. calls for release of Bogdan Syrotiuk on Tamil Nadu YouTube channel",
        "body": "facebook icon\n\nOn June 23, R. Shreeharan, a Political Committee member of the Socialist Equality Party in Sri Lanka, was interviewed by the \"Let's Talk Everything\" YouTube channel about the US-NATO-orchestrated war against Russia in Ukraine and the International Committee of the Fourth International's campaign for the release Bogdan Syrotiuk.\n\nThe channel, which has over 23,000 subscribers and 250,000 viewers, is based in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is connected to \"Let's Talk History,\" another YouTube channel that has over 61,000 subscribers and 3.5 million viewers. Both channels are broadcast in Tamil by Gabriel Devadoss.\n\nThe English-language title of Shreeharan's interview read, \"Is the Russia-Ukraine war spreading to other parts of the world?\" Its Tamil title page said, \"Will the Russia-Ukraine war change into a nuclear war? The ultimate target of the US is to collide with China.\" The 30-minute interview has been watched by 4,000 people so far with most viewers commenting positively.\n\nShreeharan discussed the ongoing proxy war in Ukraine against Russia, the danger of a nuclear third world war, and the detention of socialist Bogdan Syrotiuk by Ukraine's Zelensky government. Syrotiuk is the secretary of Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninist (YGBL), which is affiliated to the International Committee of Fourth International (ICFI), and a writer for the World Socialist Web Site.\n\nGabriel Devadoss began the interview by noting the alignment of the US-led imperialist powers one side and Russia, North Korea and China on the other.\n\nShreeharan responded by explaining that the US had initially promised not to cross various \"red lines\" in Ukraine but that the Biden administration, with the help of the Republicans, had crossed all these lines, providing battle tanks, missiles, billions of dollars and allowing Ukraine to attack inside Russia with US-provided long-range missiles.\n\n\"NATO forces have already entered Ukraine in the name of training soldiers in the new technology provided by US. Now the US is planning to send NATO troops to Ukraine because it has suffered military debacles and the loss of half a million soldiers so far,\" he said.\n\n\"Putin, however, cannot tolerate bombs and missiles exploding in Russian cities and will be compelled to retaliate and NATO can retaliate if any its member states is attacked. Such a scenario would trigger a world war that would be a massive human catastrophe.\n\n\"There are now discussions within the US political establishment that the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki 'ended the war' and so justify the use of nuclear weapons to end [current] wars,\" he added.\n\nA question was asked about the situation facing Putin and whether he would choose to use nuclear weapons. Shreeharan explained how Putin had been provoked by the eastward expansion of NATO over decades and the encirclement of Russia by NATO forces.\n\n\"Putin expected a compromise with the imperialist powers by making nuclear threats and launching a war on Ukraine. He miscalculated that the imperialist powers, fearing an all-out war, would roll back. The major powers, however, want to occupy and plunder resource-rich Russia in preparation for war against China as the next step, and ultimately domination of the world,\" he said.\n\nEmphasising this point, the SEP Political Committee member quoted NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg who has stated, \"What happens in Europe matters for Asia. What happens in Asia matters for us. And this is clearly demonstrated in Ukraine, where Iran, North Korea and China are propping up and fuelling Russia's war aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\nConfronted with this sort of war situation, Shreeharan continued, \"Putin would be forced to launch a counter-offensive and may use nuclear weapons... However, the imperialist powers themselves could use nuclear weapons which would create a catastrophe. The US needs a war to challenge the growth of China.\" The speaker later pointed out that some US politicians had suggested the Gaza war could be ended by using nuclear weapons.\n\nResponding to a question about European opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Shreeharan elaborated on the role played by Germany in the 2014 coup and Washington's efforts to topple the then-elected pro-Moscow Ukraine government and replace it with a pro-US regime.\n\nShreeharan explained the Trotskyist movement's opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, referring to an ICFI statement issued at the outset of the war which said, \"Putin does not stand for the Russian working class but represents the oligarchs in the country and stands for their profit interests.\"\n\nTurning to the suppression of democratic rights in Ukraine and Russia, Shreeharan explained the two-month detention of YGBL secretary Bogdan Syrotiuk:\n\n\"As previously noted, the US in 2014 funded the overthrow of the elected Ukrainian government in a coup and now extreme-right organisations that follow the principles of Stephen Bandera, a Nazi, are very active.\n\n\"The entire Zelensky regime operates as a fascist regime with no one allowed to speak out against the war and opposition parties and communists are banned. But now, under conditions where 500,000 soldiers have been killed, there is popular opposition to war. People are now being forcibly drafted into the military and put on the frontline. This is why the socialist Bogdan Syrotiuk was arrested. This is a matter of freedom of expression,\" Shreeharan said\n\n\"Anti-war sentiment prevails in Ukraine\" he continued, and said the Zelensky regime was concerned that this mass opposition will be given expression through organisations such as the YGBL. \"There is a fear that it could become a pole of attraction for the mass opposition. That's why they arrested Bogdan.\n\n\"Bogdan is fighting to unite the Ukrainian and Russian working class, as well as the international working class, to end the war and for an international socialist program to overthrow the capitalist system. He was arrested because of this fight,\" he said.\n\nShreeharan explained that the Zelensky regime had falsely accused Bogdan of treason and subsequently banned World Socialist Web Site in Ukraine, claiming that it functioned as 'a Russian propaganda and information agency.'\n\n\"This is how the democratic rights are being brutally suppressed in Ukraine,\" he said and called on viewers to sign the petition and support the ICFI's campaign to release Bogdan.\n\nShreeharan said Putin, as a representative of the Russian oligarchy, promoted anti-migrant and right-wing movements while suppressing opposition protests.\n\n\"Neither Putin nor Biden, however, can wage a war allowing democratic rights. Inevitably they are compelled to use dictatorial rule to suppress working people who are rising up against the slashing of social conditions and the imposition of the massive costs of war,\" he said.\n\nThe speaker noted Putin's alliances with North Korea and China and warned that US-NATO war operations against Russia would escalate and expand into military conflict with China. To stop this worsening catastrophe, he said, \"The working class must unite and fight against their imperialist governments and fight to bring workers' governments to power. This is possible.\n\n\"The First World War was ended by the socialist revolution in Russia in 1917 under the leadership of Lenin and Trotsky. That is why the ICFI, its sections, and the WSWS are fighting to build an anti-war movement of the international working class,\" Shreeharan said.\n\nThe speaker pointed to the eruption of massive protests across the US universities against the Gaza genocide, strike action by academics against police attacks on student protesters at the University of California, and ongoing demonstrations internationally against Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nShreeharan explained that the trade unions in the US, and internationally, were sabotaging and suppressing these struggles. He called for workers to break from these organisations and pseudo-left formations that justify imperialism and war.\n\n\"Workers must mobilise their political strength independently. In this way workers can take matters into their own hands by building action committees in their workplaces and creating unity among workers, that could pave the way for an international working-class solidarity.\"\n\nRead moreStop the US-NATO escalation toward nuclear war!

        "title": "Cyber Extortion Reached Record High in US and Canada in 2023: Marsh",
        "body": "Multiple companies in the United States and Canada experienced a record number of cyber extortion events in 2023 and unprecedented demands, a new report from Marsh shows.\n\nThe report, Ransomware: A persistent challenge in cyber insurance claims, also showed an increasing number of companies refused to pay the demands.\n\nThe report's authors analyzed more than 1,800 cyber claims submitted to Marsh in the U.S. and Canada in 2023. They found the annual percentage of clients reporting at least one cyber event has was steady over the past five years, ranging between 16% and 21%. The authors say the report demonstrates that companies' cyber controls have kept pace with the growing threat and frequency of cyberattacks.\n\nHealthcare, communications, retail/wholesale, financial institutions and education were the top five of most affected industry sectors, with healthcare and communications reaching the highest numbers of annual claims, the report shows.\n\n21% of clients that purchased a cyber policy reported an event in 2023.\n\n*\n\nIn 2023, events were driven by factors including increased sophistication of cyberattacks; the MOVEit event, a wave of cyberattacks and data breaches that began in June of that year, highlighting supply chain vulnerabilities; and privacy claims.\n\n*\n\nRansomware represented less than one-fifth of claims reported, but remained a top concern for organizations given their increased frequency, sophistication and potential severity.\n\nThe record number of events in 2023 followed a dip in extortion events in 2022. The reasons for the decrease in 2022 is hard to say, but cybersecurity experts inside and outside of Marsh cite a temporary move away from data encryption toward exfiltration, disruptions brought on by the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, decreased willingness of some companies to pay and the successful \"infiltration\" of a particular ransomware group by the FBI.\n\nThe median extortion payment fell from $822,000 in 2021 to $335,000 in 2022. That trend was reversed in 2023, when the median payment increased from $335,000 to $6.5 million and the median demand increased from $1.4 million to $20 million. The percentage of the median demand paid increased from 24% in 2022 to 32% in 2023, according to the report.\n\nDuring the last five quarters, the median cost of breach response expenses remained at $160,000, while the average trended from $963,000 in the third quarter of 2023 to $1 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to a few large cyber events, Marsh said.\n\nRansomware claims also rose in 2023, but the report shows the number of reported ransomware events has remained under 20% of reported claims for the past two years.\n\n\"This means that privacy claims and system attacks leading to unauthorized access and potentially exposed data without an extortion component comprise a much larger share of cyber events reported by Marsh clients than do those with an extortion component,\" the report states.\n\nAnother report out in May found 51% of respondents ranked ransomware as the primary cyber concern for the third straight year, with 45% claiming to have been hit by a ransomware attack in the last 12 months. A large majority, 86%, said these attacks included data exfiltration.",

But NATO members were spending less on defense under Biden until the Russia-Ukraine war broke out, prompting the alliance to finally increase spending, according to official alliance documents.\n\nBiden claimed during a debate against former President Donald Trump on Thursday that NATO was \"strong\" under his administration and bragged about how he got \"50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine,\" warning that Trump would pull out of the alliance if reelected.\n\nHis comments echo remarks made weeks and months earlier, in which he claimed his administration was responsible for NATO's success.\n\n\"Trump wants to eviscerate NATO. He thinks NATO is useless,\" Biden told Time in an interview in June. \"NATO is considerably stronger than it was when I took office. I put it together. Not only did I reestablish the fact that it was the strongest alliance in the history of the world, I was able to expand it.\"\n\n\"America is a founding member of NATO,\" Biden said during his State of the Union address in March. \"Today, we've made NATO stronger than ever.\"\n\nNATO members are currently spending more on defense than they have in the last decade. Members of NATO, including the U.K. Canada and the European Union (EU) nations, are obligated to spend at least 2% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defense spending as part of their alliance agreement.\n\n\"I've worked really hard, spent hours and hours and hours doing this,\" Biden said on NATO in a May interview with Howard Stern, who thanked him for working on making the alliance stronger. \"And the idea that had we not gotten this done, I think you would've seen a beginning of disintegration of NATO.\"\n\nIt is expected that 23 of the 32 members will hit the 2% minimum in 2024, up from 10 members the year prior, according to NATO defense expenditures.\n\nThe jump in spending comes alongside the surging Russia-Ukraine war, which has engulfed Eastern Europe and concerned members that Moscow could target them next. Prior to and during the immediate aftermath of the Russia war, fewer NATO members were meeting their spending targets under Biden than they were under Trump.\n\nOnly seven NATO members hit their spending goals in 2022, up from six in 2021, according to alliance defense expenditures. In 2020, Trump's last full year in office, nine members were hitting their spending targets.\n\nTrump routinely pressured members of NATO to meet their defense spending goals during his tenure, threatening to pull the U.S. out of the alliance if they didn't. The number of NATO countries meeting their spending targets more than doubled from the start to the end of Trump's presidency, before dropping in 2021 once Biden took office, according to expenditures.\n\n\"The only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. I said, and he is right about this, I said, 'No, I'm not going to support NATO if you don't pay, I won't do that,\" Trump said during Thursday's debate. \"And you know what happened? Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months. But now, we're in the same position. We're paying everybody's bills.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Members of NATO, including the U.K. Canada and the European Union (EU) nations, are obligated to spend at least 2% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defense spending as part of their alliance agreement.\n\n\"I've worked really hard, spent hours and hours and hours doing this,\" Biden said on NATO in a May interview with Howard Stern, who thanked him for working on making the alliance stronger. \"And the idea that had we not gotten this done, I think you would've seen a beginning of disintegration of NATO.\"\n\nIt is expected that 23 of the 32 members will hit the 2% minimum in 2024, up from 10 members the year prior, according to NATO defense expenditures.\n\nThe jump in spending comes alongside the surging Russia-Ukraine war, which has engulfed Eastern Europe and concerned members that Moscow could target them next. Prior to and during the immediate aftermath of the Russia war, fewer NATO members were meeting their spending targets under Biden than they were under Trump.\n\nOnly seven NATO members hit their spending goals in 2022, up from six in 2021, according to alliance defense expenditures. In, 2020, Trump's last full year in office, nine members were hitting their spending targets.\n\nTrump routinely pressured members of NATO to meet their defense spending goals during his tenure, threatening to pull the U.S. out of the alliance if they didn't. The number of NATO countries meeting their spending targets more than doubled from the start to the end of Trump's presidency, before dropping in 2021 once Biden took office, according to expenditures.\n\n\"The only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. I said, and he is right about this, I said, 'No, I'm not going to support NATO if you don't pay, I won't do that,\" Trump said during Thursday's debate. \"And you know what happened? Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months. But now, we're in the same position. We're paying everybody's bills.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "summary": "The article discusses how NATO members began to take their defense spending commitments seriously only after the Russia-Ukraine war erupted, despite President Joe Biden's claims of strengthening the alliance. Biden has frequently stated that he made NATO more robust than it was under former President Donald Trump, who had pressured NATO members to meet their spending targets. Under Biden, fewer NATO members were meeting their defense spending goals until the war in Eastern Europe prompted an increase. In 2024, 23 out of 32 NATO members are expected to meet the 2% GDP defense spending requirement, up from 10 members the previous year. The article highlights the contrast between Biden's and Trump's approaches to NATO, with Trump threatening to pull the U.S. out of the alliance to ensure compliance, resulting in increased spending during his tenure. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the matter.",

        "title": "Ageing MR Product Tanker Fleet Could Impact Future Market Prospects",
        "body": "According to Gibson, \"nonetheless, despite the increase in scheduled deliveries in 2025 and 2026, the number of tankers in the 15-to-19-year bracket is still higher. In addition, another 13% of the current fleet is 20 years of age or over, with many of these vessels finding alternative employment opportunities outside the conventional market, primarily on the back of changing geopolitical dynamics. The Russia-Ukraine war coupled with the Red Sea crisis has boosted tonne miles demand. At the same time, the growing influx of vessels into the dark fleet has pulled tonnage from the mainstream MR market helping to support rates. We currently estimate that 181 out of approximately 1,720 vessels in the MR fleet are exclusively trading in Iran, Venezuela, and Russia. This significant portion, which is around 10% of the fleet, is substantial enough for their absence from the main trade to be felt\".\n\nThe shipbroker said that \"the combination of growing demand and tightening supply of tankers available to international players is supporting the consistent strength in the MR market. For the year to date, global spot TCE earnings have averaged $35,000/day (non-Eco) and $31,250/day in 2022/23. This compares to an average of $13,500/day between 2010 and 2019. Structural changes in clean tanker flows due to sanctions on Russia are likely to stay in place for the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, there is a great degree of uncertainty when it comes to Red Sea attacks. It is impossible to predict how long the Israel/Gaza conflict will last, but if/when tanker traffic through the Red Sea resumes, it will have negative implications for clean tonne miles demand, although it will be felt most acutely by larger product carriers. For the MR trade specifically, the Dangote refinery in West Africa and the Olmeca refinery in Mexico could disrupt the traditional structure of the clean trade, potentially harming the market. On the upside, however, the earmarked closure of multiple refineries in Europe between 2025 and 2027 may still facilitate regional CPP imports despite disappointing demand indicators\".\n\n\"The exact effects of these demand-side developments are yet to play out. On supply side, however, the picture is much clearer: unless the orderbook continues to grow, the size of the fleet under 20 years of age will continue to shrink\", Gibson concluded.\n\nNikos Roussanoglou, Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide",

Key points include:\n\n1. **Aging Fleet**: A significant portion of the MR tanker fleet is aging, with many vessels over 15 years old and 13% over 20 years old, often finding alternative employment due to geopolitical changes.\n2. **Geopolitical Factors**: The Russia-Ukraine war and the Red Sea crisis have increased demand for tankers, while many vessels are now trading in Iran, Venezuela, and Russia, reducing the mainstream fleet by about 10%.\n3. **Market Impact**: The combination of rising demand and a tightening supply of tankers has supported strong market rates, with global spot TCE earnings significantly higher than the 2010-2019 average.\n4. **Future Uncertainties**: The Israel/Gaza conflict and potential disruptions from new refineries in West Africa and Mexico could negatively impact the market, while refinery closures in Europe might boost regional imports.\n5. **Supply Concerns**: Without an increase in new orders, the fleet of tankers under 20 years old will continue to shrink, potentially affecting market dynamics.\n\nThe article concludes that while demand-side effects are uncertain, the supply-side outlook is clearer, emphasizing the need for fleet renewal to maintain market stability.",

        "body": "Several United States military bases across Europe were put on a heightened state of alert over the weekend due to concerns that a potential terrorist attack could target personnel or facilities, according to CNN who spoke to U.S. officials on Sunday.\n\nU.S. Army garrison in Stuttgart, Germany, where U.S. European Command (EUCOM) is headquartered, issued a community-wide elevated alert level to Force Protection Condition (FPCON) \"Charlie\" on Sunday until further notice. The alert status aims to ensure readiness and rapid response capabilities for any potential threats in the region.\n\nAccording to CNN, who spoke to one of the U.S. officials who is stationed at a base in Europe, said they haven't seen this threat level \"in at least 10 years,\" and said it usually means the military has received an \"active-reliable threat.\"\n\nThe U.S. Army employs a system called FPCON to assess and communicate the level of threat to military personnel and resources. These conditions range from normal peacetime operations to the highest state of alert in response to specific threats. According to the U.S. Army, the five FPCON levels are Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie or Delta, the highest state of alert.\n\nHowever, Bravo, which indicates an increased or more predictable threat of terrorist activity, became common and implemented widely as a preventive measure to enhance security and preparedness across all Department of Defense (DOD) facilities for many years following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Meanwhile, Charlie sets in motion \"curtailment plans for nonessential personnel.\"\n\nAlthough it's unclear what triggered the heightened security level, European authorities have warned of a potential terror threat on the continent due to highly public events such the Paris Olympics in July and the current European football championships in Germany.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the U.S. Army and the DOD via email for comment.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Army, the Charlie level of alert \"applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely.\"\n\nAddressing the alert on Sunday, EUCOM said in a statement that it is \"constantly assessing a variety of factors that play into the safety of the U.S. military community abroad. As part of that effort, we often times take additional steps to ensure the safety of our service members.\"\n\nMeanwhile, garrison officials in Stuttgart said that a variety of services would be affected because of the increased threat level, adding that until further notice some of those reduced services include access to some eateries and on-post barber shops.\n\n\"Many other services will have significant numbers of employees teleworking or offices will be opened with reduced staff. Customers should maintain flexibility and allow for longer-than-normal service times,\" the garrison said in a statement.\n\nIn addition to the garrison in Stuttgart, the Charlie level alert is also in place at the Aviano Air Base in Italy, according to Stars and Stripes.\n\nThe alert comes after President Joe Biden's announcement at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) summit in Madrid in June 2022 highlighted a significant increase in U.S. military presence in Europe, with over 100,000 U.S. service members now stationed across the continent. This includes the establishment of a permanent headquarters for the U.S. 5th Army Corps in Poland, aimed at improving command and control, interoperability with NATO allies, and overall defensive readiness.\n\nIn addition, Biden said he would also deploy additional air defense, logistics and engineer assets in Germany and add air defense capabilities to forces in Italy.\n\n\"NATO is strong, united, and the steps we're taking during this summit are going to further augment our collective strength,\" the president said at the time. \"To that end, today, I'm announcing the United States will enhance our force posture in Europe to respond to the change [in the] security environment, as well as strengthening our collective security.\"\n\nBiden's announcement comes as a response to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. In addition, tensions between NATO countries and the Kremlin have continued as NATO leaders have increasingly warned that direct conflict with Moscow is a realistic danger. This comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin and senior Russian officials have repeatedly threatened nuclear escalation against Kyiv and its Western partners since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",

Biden attempted to defend his record, which needs a lot of defending, leaving the queasy feeling that neither man is really fit to be president.\"\n\nBolton does not mention who to vote for.\n\n\"Claiming Biden was weak didn't deter Trump from also calling him a warmonger: 'These are wars that will never end with him. He will drive us into World War III and we're closer to World War Three than anybody can imagine,'\" Bolton wrote, quoting the debate. \"'President Xi of China, Kim Jong Un of North Korea, all of these - Putin - they don't respect him. They don't fear him.'\n\n\"In Trump's surreal world, all of this makes sense.\"\n\nBolton does not explain why Trump's reasoning is not reality - he even though his words appear to agree.\n\n\"On Ukraine, Trump continued claiming that, had he been president, Russia never would have invaded (again unprovable but also irrefutable),\" Bolton wrote. \"He pledged to resolve the Russia-Ukraine war as president-elect, even before being inaugurated next Jan. 20.\"\n\nUltimately, Biden's reelection campaign took a hit Thursday night, because of the reality Trump and conservative media have been trying to get Americans to hear: Biden's weakness is threat to global security.\n\n\"The coming days will determine whether Biden survives as the presumptive Democratic nominee,\" Bolton concluded. \"Even if he does, however, it is harder than before to deny he is in serious, potentially fatal political trouble - and at a time when the free world has rarely been in greater need of effective leadership.\"\n\nEric Mack \u2709\n\nEric Mack has been a writer and editor at Newsmax since 2016.

        "body": "President Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN). Her euro-skeptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nParticipation was high, underlining how France's rumbling political crisis has energized the electorate. By 1500 GMT, turnout was nearly 60%, compared with 39.42% two years ago - the highest comparable turnout figures since the 1986 legislative vote, Ipsos France's research director Mathieu Gallard said.\n\nFrance's electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of the second round of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" Le Pen said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, would be prime minister.\n\nShe has sought to detoxify a party known for racism and antisemitism, a tactic that has worked amid voter anger at Macron, the high cost of living and growing concerns over immigration.\n\nIn H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, a town in Le Pen's constituency in northern France where she may be re-elected in the first round, 67-year-old Denis Ledieu said people were suffering due to the long-term de-industrializaton of the region.\n\n\"So if the (RN) promises them things, then why not? They want to try it out, I think,\" he said.\n\nIn Garches, a small town near Paris, a woman screamed \"It's shameful, it's shameful\" as Bardella arrived to cast his vote.\n\n\"They even invited the leftists,\" he said.\n\nOn the other side of Paris, in the town of Meaux, 51-year-old Myl\u00e8ne Diop said she had voted for the New Popular Front, a hastily assembled left-wing coalition polling in second. She said it was \"the most important election\" of her life.\n\n\"The RN is at the gates of power and you see the aggressiveness of people and the racist speech that has been unleashed,\" she said.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella says he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of its contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity on defense.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVORS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33%-36% of the popular vote, with the New Popular Front in second place on 28%-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20%-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate center-left to the hard-left, euro-skeptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favors the National Rally,\" Martigny said.\n\nFor decades, as the RN steadily gained popularity, voters and parties joined forces to block it from winning power, but that may not hold true this time.",

        "summary": "In a high-turnout election in France, President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance faces a significant challenge from Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN), which recently outperformed Macron's party in European elections. Polls indicate the RN could secure a majority in the National Assembly, with Le Pen predicting her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jordan Bardella, as prime minister. The election has energized voters, with turnout reaching nearly 60% by mid-afternoon, the highest since 1986.\n\nLe Pen has attempted to rebrand the RN, historically associated with racism and antisemitism, amid public discontent over Macron's policies, the cost of living, and immigration. A potential RN victory could lead to a turbulent period in French politics, with Macron and Bardella vying for influence. This could strain France's relationship with the EU and alter its stance on the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nThe New Popular Front, a left-wing coalition, is polling second, while Macron's alliance is third. The complex electoral system makes it difficult to predict the final distribution of seats, but high participation and split voting could favor the RN. Historically, other parties have united to block the RN, but this may not happen in this election.",

ARNAUD FINISTRE/Pool via REUTERS\n\nBy Layli Foroudi and Mimosa Spencer\n\nPARIS (Reuters) -French voters flocked to the polls on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country's first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nParticipation was high, underlining how France's rumbling political crisis has energized the electorate.

        "body": "DARTFORD, England -- Distrust has settled over the campaign trails in the United States and United Kingdom ahead of July 4 like a soggy summer haze.\n\nOn that day, British voters will choose a new Parliament in an election expected to finish with a Labour government after 14 years under the Conservatives. Americans, polarized by the rematch between Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, will mark Independence Day in something resembling unity with barbecues and fireworks ahead of their vote on Nov. 5.\n\nThere's much to celebrate on the Fourth of July for one of the world's biggest democracies and the venerable kingdom that gave rise to it, 248 years after they split and set off on slow, troubled journeys toward granting all citizens the right to vote. Both remain rooted in the Magna Carta, the English document signed in 1215. It set in writing the idea that leaders -- including kings, presidents and their governments -- are not above the law. The nations have become close friends and stalwart allies.\n\n\"I'm just very disheartened, really, because I don't think any of the parties know what they're doing,\" Dartford, England, resident Jacqueline Richards, 77, said of her country's election. \"But then looking at yours in America, it's not that great, is it?\"\n\nEvery democratic election is, at its core, about who voters trust to run their country so they can go about running their lives.\n\nDebates are candidate aptitude tests in real time. Thursday's showdown between Biden, 81, and Trump, 77, proved a stark example. Biden's halting performance did the opposite of building confidence, even among some of his supporters. Trump, meanwhile, repeated his lies about the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and his record as president.\n\nThat's only the most recent example of why distrust and resignation dominate the emotional landscape in both countries, according to voters interviewed by The Associated Press in recent weeks. From battleground Wisconsin to bellwether Dartford, voters said years of misinformation, scandal and lies have drained them of the sort of optimism or excitement they might once have felt about the right to vote or the future.\n\nIn Britain, 45% said they \"almost never\" trust governments to put the nation's interest first, up from 34% in 2019, according to a survey published June 12 by the National Centre for Social Research. The pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine War and the country's cost-of-living crisis affected living standards and the economy, it reported. Two Tory prime ministers were ousted. Also, there was Boris Johnson, who resigned rather than be thrown out of Parliament over boozy parties at 10 Downing Street when the nation was under COVID-19 lockdown.\n\n\"They promise and promise and promise and nothing ever changes,\" said Shane Bassett, 34, the bar manager at a pub in Dartford, where the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 is said to have started. \"No matter who gets in -- if it's Labour, if it's Conservative, it's all the same. They all lie.\"\n\nIn the United States, trust has been eroded by deepening political polarization, misinformation and Trump's lies about Biden's victory in the 2020 election -- all amplified by social media.\n\nRoughly 2 in 10 Americans say they trust the U.S. government to do what is right \"just about always\" or \"most of the time,\" according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. About 6 in 10 say they can trust the government \"only some of the time\" and about 2 in 10 say they can never trust the government to do what's right.\n\nNearly three-quarters of American adults blame the news media for dividing the nation, according to a 2023 poll by AP-NORC. Families and friends have learned to avoid discussing politics around Thanksgiving tables and other gatherings. In many places, even celebrations of the Fourth of July -- a national holiday when Americans mark the 1776 ratification of the Declaration of Independence from Britain -- fall under this practice of restraint.\n\nIn Racine, Wisconsin, Rebecca Eisel, 48, wondered how the vast United States, home of 262 million eligible voters and the world's biggest economy, faces a rematch that few Americans wanted.\n\n\"How did our democratic process result in something that the majority of the population doesn't like?\" said Eisel, 48.\n\nThe last time Kathleen Barker, 64, was excited about a candidate, it was Ronald Reagan, who went on to serve two terms in the 1980s and exited office by referring to the country as a \"shining city on a hill.\"\n\n\"You could relate to him,\" she said while walking her dog near the river in Racine. \"He felt like just that average man.\"\n\nNow she says, the \"nasty back and forth\" between Biden and Trump -- who each insist the other is unfit for office -- suggest neither can be trusted to dig into the major problems facing the United States.\n\n\"People are poor. The country is struggling. And this is their focus?\" she said.\n\nEmmanuel McKinstry, a 58-year-old businessperson, voiced similar frustration. The economy, he said while waiting in line to hear Trump speak in Racine, is his top issue. The next morning, McKinstry said he'd still vote for Trump -- with reservations.\n\n\"I'm tired of politicians working for themselves and not really getting down and asking people what we really want,\" McKinstry said. \"We're putting you in office. What are you gonna do for us?\"\n\nIn Britain, the distrust is less personal. It's about scandal -- think Johnson and \"partygate\" -- and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nThat's what concerns Bassett, the manager at the Wat Tyler Pub. You're not supposed to talk about politics in British pubs, he says -- the counterpart, perhaps, of the American reluctance to stir up trouble on the same topic at parties.\n\nBut Bassett looked around at the empty dining room at lunch time. There were no customers to offend. So he let it fly.\n\nThe pub's energy bill last winter jumped from its usual 800 pounds a month (about $1,000) to 1,200 pounds (about $1,500). It has struggled since the Christmas season to bring in customers for a beer. He thinks the owners are likely to sell the place only four years after buying it.\n\n\"I'm not very optimistic,\" he said. \"If I could leave the country, I would.\"\n\nChristine Fernando reported from Racine, Wisconsin.

        "body": "(Chris Samuels | The Salt Lake Tribune) The Capitol and the Church Office Building, Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2024. While the church sharpens its global focus, it's become less vocal on political issues within the United States.\n\nIt is no surprise that Latter-day Saints have an outsized love for July Fourth, the day to celebrate the birth of America.\n\nAfter all, the United States is where Mormons believe founder Joseph Smith saw God and Jesus in a New York grove of trees, where the nascent church was founded.\n\nAnd for most of its nearly 200-year history, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been dominated by Americans, has sometimes endorsed major U.S. policies (including the invasion of Iraq) and has celebrated the nation as a divinely endorsed \"land of promise.\"\n\nThese days, though, the 17.2 million-member church sees itself -- and its political principles -- less parochially and more globally.\n\nIt has not, for example, weighed in on the Russia-Ukraine war, and plans to remove all national anthems from its hymnals.\n\nThough the majority of American Latter-day Saints are Republicans, the Utah-based faith maintains strict political neutrality, while declaring that \"some principles compatible with the gospel may be found in various political parties.\"\n\nThe church urges members to \"seek candidates who best embody\" those principles. Members should also study candidates carefully and vote for those who have \"demonstrated integrity, compassion, and service to others, regardless of party affiliation.\"\n\nBYU professor explores faith and politics\n\nRichard Davis, an emeritus Brigham Young University political science professor, set out to discover what that meant to Latter-day Saint politicians.\n\nHe enlisted the aid of several BYU students to interview more than 70 politicians across the globe, the country and Utah, then chose 25 to highlight in his book, \"Faith and Politics: Latter-day Saints Politicians Tell Their Stories.\"\n\nInternational politicians featured in the book include five Euopeans, one Canadian, and one African. U.S. politicians from outside the West included three Republicans and one Democrat, in offices ranging from city council member to congressional representative.\n\nWestern politicians included the late Harry Reid, the five-term U.S. Senator from Nevada who became the highest-ranking elected Latter-day Saint in the nation's history when he captured the title of Senate majority leader.\n\nUtah politicos include Republican Deidre Henderson, Utah's current lieutenant governor, Democrat Brian King, a longtime Utah representative who is now running for governor, and several former federal and state officials.\n\nHow, Davis wondered, did these men and women navigate their faith and their public positions? Should these believers even engage in the world of politics?\n\nIs political involvement anathema to faith?\n\n(Bethany Baker | The Salt Lake Tribune) The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Church Office Building near the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, April 17, 2024.\n\n\"Isn't politics dirty?\" Davis says some members ask. \"Doesn't that mean a church member would have to compromise his or her principles, verbally attack others, or become part of one group or political party that attacks another group?\"\n\nDavis found their answers insightful and even inspiring.\n\n\"These politicians revealed, sometimes quite poignantly,\" he writes in the introduction, \"how they handle the tensions they face in government office while seeking to retain their faith and practice.\"\n\nThe political scientist was moved, he says in an interview, by the politicians' candor about \"the challenges they faced, such as anti-Mormon hostility, gender bias within LDS culture, or personal conflict with other politicians, and how the teachings of the gospel helped them through those challenges.\"\n\nThe book is divided into four parts by geography: international, U.S. outside the West, U.S. inside the West, and Utah.\n\nDavis was seeking an array of political opinions and perspectives, he says, from liberal to conservative, from men and women, from outside the United States to inside the Mountain West and the Beehive State, from the smallest municipal elections to the state and federal levels.\n\nHe especially wanted to highlight the positions of faithful Latter-day Saint Democrats, who are often demonized by the faith's Republican majority, many of whom believe that party is not compatible with the church.\n\nDavis himself was long associated with the Democratic Party as one of its leaders in Utah County, and then later helped found the United Utah Party to \"reach across party lines\" and favor \"moderation rather than extremism.\"\n\nHe showcased in his book the increasing number of Latter-day Saint women who are stepping up politically.\n\nAs a global faith, the church \"is very different than it was 50 or even 20 years ago,\" Davis says, \"when it defended American policies like the Vietnam War or going into Iraq.\"\n\nThe change makes sense for church leaders to watch their rhetoric, he says. \"They can't be in the business of being an American church defending U.S. politics if they are going to send missionaries to countries that don't share those views.\"\n\n'Negative perceptions about Latter-day Saints'\n\n(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints flies dozens of flags from around the globe near the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City.\n\nBeing in a tiny minority in some countries means it can be difficult for a Latter-day Saint to be, say, a European member of Parliament or an African mayor.\n\nThose in Davis' book described the issues they faced, including \"negative perceptions about Latter-day Saints ... and the challenge of representing constituencies where few share their religious affiliation.\"\n\nBut their involvement can also produce \"goodwill toward Latter-day Saints,\" Davis writes, and \"can signal to a broader public that Latter-day Saints are good citizens ...\"\n\nIn general, European Latter-day Saint politicians are more diverse politically, says Ralf Gr\u00fcnke, a German who won a seat on the Nidderau City Council as an independent on the Green Party ballot while also serving as an Latter-day Saint bishop.\n\n\"The political spectrum among Latter-day Saints being active in politics ... is much broader [in Europe] than it is in Utah,\" Grunke says in the book. \"I know Latter-day Saints ... who are active in conservative parties, the Social Democrat Party, the former Community Party, the Free Democrats, the Green Party, my little party, far right, far left, anything back and forth, if at all.\"\n\nGrunke can't cite any research on this issue, but has the impression \"that on continental Europe, church members tend to lean toward the political left.\"\n\nDavis agrees.\n\nEven politicians considered \"conservative\" on that continent, he says, \"are much more liberal than conservatives in the U.S.\"\n\nRunning for office in a male-dominated culture\n\n(Chris Samuels | The Salt Lake Tribune) Aimee Winder Newton delivers remarks after being sworn in for a third term as Salt Lake County Council member at the County Government Center in Salt Lake City, Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2023.\n\nOf the 25 politicians in this book, nine are women -- a higher percentage than Latter-day Saint women who actually serve in public office, Davis notes.\n\nHe purposely \"overrepresented women\" to showcase their perspectives within Utah, the western United States and beyond.\n\n\"It was intended,\" Davis says, \"to offer models for future involvement by Latter-day Saint women.\"\n\nThese women have to work against the perspectives from a male-dominated culture, says Aimee Winder Newton, a Republican who ran for Utah governor in 2020.\n\n\"We grow up seeing mostly male leaders. On Sundays we see men who are sitting up on the stand,\" she says in the book. \"We have a very patriarchal culture, and I don't think a lot of people are used to seeing female leaders.\"\n\nDuring her campaign, Newton received text messages saying, \"Women don't belong in government or the law,\" or, \"You need to be home cooking meals and cleaning your house instead of doing this.\"\n\nShe brushed it off, she says, and focused on policies. Now, Winder Newton sits on the Salt Lake County Council, where the leadership is all women.\n\nHer perspective on faith in politics mirrors other men and women in the book.\n\n\"I have Jesus Christ as my role model on how we should treat people ... I am able to be very empathetic towards other people and put myself in their shoes,\" she says. \"... I also have a desire for unity and peace, and I think that's something that comes from church teachings.\"\n\nChallenges of getting involved\n\n(Briana Scroggins | Special to The Tribune) Former U.S. Rep. Ben McAdams speaks during the Utah Democratic Convention at Cottonwood High School in Murray on Saturday, April 23, 2022.\n\nSeveral of the Latter-day Saint politicians mentioned their two-year missions for the church as a catalyst for their careers in public service.\n\nBen McAdams, a Democratic ex-U.S. representative from Utah and a former Salt Lake County mayor, was concerned about the poverty he saw in Brazil, while Andria Tupola, a Republican member of the Hawaii House of Representatives from 2015 to 2019 and current member of the Honolulu City Council, wanted to fight government corruption that she witnessed in Venezuela.\n\nOthers were asked by friends or mentors to jump into the political arena. However, that is not often the case for those outside Latter-day Saint-dominated areas.\n\n\"There may be no one there to invite them to participate,\" Davis writes, which could \"harm the church's ability to interact with government in these areas.\"\n\nStill, Davis believes Latter-day Saint politicians could play an increasingly crucial role in the worldwide public sphere.\n\n\"It is vital,\" he concludes, that everyone engaged in political activity \"see every other person, whether we agree with them or not, as a child of God.\"\n\nEditor's note * This story is available to Salt Lake Tribune subscribers only.

        "summary": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is shifting its focus from American politics to a more global perspective. Historically, the church has been heavily involved in U.S. politics, endorsing major policies and celebrating America as a divinely favored nation. However, the church now maintains strict political neutrality and encourages members to vote based on principles rather than party affiliation.\n\nRichard Davis, an emeritus professor at Brigham Young University, explores the intersection of faith and politics among Latter-day Saint politicians in his book \"Faith and Politics: Latter-day Saints Politicians Tell Their Stories.\" The book features interviews with 25 politicians from various regions, including Europe, Canada, Africa, and the U.S., highlighting their experiences and challenges in balancing faith with public service.\n\nDavis found that Latter-day Saint politicians face unique challenges such as anti-Mormon hostility, gender bias, and personal conflicts. Despite these obstacles, their faith often guides them in their political roles. The book also emphasizes the increasing political involvement of Latter-day Saint women and the broader political spectrum among European church members compared to their American counterparts.\n\nThe LDS Church's global focus necessitates a more neutral stance on political issues to facilitate missionary work in diverse countries. This shift reflects the church's evolution from a predominantly American institution to a global faith community.",

        "title": "Watch: Farage speech interrupted by huge banner of Putin",
        "body": "Nigel Farage was caught off guard at his latest campaign rally when a banner showing a smiling Vladimir Putin dropped down behind him live on stage.\n\nThe Reform UK leader asked \"who put that up there?\" and said someone at the venue should \"get the sack\" after the poster, planted by campaign group Led By Donkeys, slowly descended from the ceiling while he addressed the audience.\n\nThe banner showed the Russian president smiling and giving a thumbs up, with the message \"I [heart] Nigel\" plastered in bold lettering across the bottom.\n\nIt comes after Mr Farage was accused of \"playing into Putin's hands\" by claiming the West provoked Russia into invading Ukraine.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Panorama, he said that the \"ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union\" gave Mr Putin a reason to justify war.\n\nRishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, accused Mr Farage of appeasing the Russian president, while Boris Johnson, who was the UK premier at the time of the invasion, claimed the Reform leader was spouting \"Kremlin propaganda\" after he doubled down on his comments in an article for The Telegraph.\n\nMr Farage has refused to back down, and last week appeared to accuse the Conservatives of capitalising on the row to distract from their own problems.\n\nThe stunt was carried out on Saturday as the Reform leader delivered a speech at the Columbine Centre in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex.\n\nPosting footage of the incident on social media, Led By Donkeys said: \"We just dropped in on Farage's election rally with a beaming picture of Putin. Nigel was not pleased.\"\n\nIn the video, the banner can be seen slowly descending behind Mr Farage midway through his speech, as he condemns \"the poison that is being taught to our children\", claiming pupils are only being told \"the bad things that we did in our history\".\n\nIt cuts to a clip of the Reform leader pointing at the poster and asking: \"Who put that up there?\"\n\nTo cheers from the crowd, Mr Farage adds: \"Someone at the Columbine Centre needs to get the sack, are we agreed?\"\n\nThe audience then launches a chant of \"rip it down\". Towards the end of the clip, two men on stage begin to tug at the banner, but appear unable to dislodge it.\n\nIn his interview with Nick Robinson for BBC Panorama earlier this month, Mr Farage was asked why he had \"blamed the West\" for Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nHe replied: \"It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union was giving this man a reason to his Russian people to say, 'they're coming for us again' and to go to war.\"\n\nAsked whether his rhetoric was echoing that of the Russian president, he said: \"But, hang on a second, we provoked this war. It's - you know, of course, it's his fault, he's used what we've done as an excuse.\"\n\nIn response, Mr Sunak said: \"What he said was completely wrong and only plays into Putin's hands.\n\n\"This is a man who deployed nerve agents on the streets of Britain, who's doing deals with countries like North Korea. And this kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain's security, the security of our allies that rely on us and only emboldens Putin further.\"\n\nIn his follow-up article for The Telegraph, Mr Farage insisted he had never been \"an apologist or supporter of Putin\", adding: \"His invasion of Ukraine was immoral, outrageous and indefensible.\n\n\"As a champion of national sovereignty, I believe that Putin was entirely wrong to invade the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Nobody can fairly accuse me of being an appeaser. I have never sought to justify Putin's invasion in any way and I'm not now.\"\n\nBut he said: \"That doesn't change the fact that I saw it coming a decade ago, warned that it was coming and am one of the few political figures who has been consistently right and honest about Russia's Ukraine war.\n\n\"What I have been saying for the past 10 years is that the West has played into Putin's hands, giving him the excuse to do what he wanted to do anyway.\"",

        "title": "American and British Voters Share Deep Roots. In 2024, They Distrust Their Own Leaders, Too",
        "body": "Distrust has settled over the campaign trails in the United States and United Kingdom ahead of July 4 like a soggy summer haze.\n\nOn that day, British voters will choose a new Parliament in an election expected to finish with a Labour government after 14 years under the Conservatives. Americans, polarized by the rematch between Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, will mark Independence Day in something resembling unity with barbecues and fireworks ahead of their vote on Nov. 5.\n\nThere's much to celebrate on the Fourth of July for one of the world's biggest democracies and the venerable kingdom that gave rise to it, 248 years after they split and set off on slow, troubled journeys toward granting all citizens the right to vote. Both remain rooted in the Magna Carta, the English document signed in 1215. It set in writing the idea that leaders -- including kings, presidents and their governments -- are not above the law. The nations have become close friends and stalwart allies.\n\nThat's how it started.\n\nAs for how it's going, the run-up to July 4, 2024 -- Independence Day for one land, Election Day for the other -- offers a snapshot of the stress test facing voters in each country.\n\n\"I'm just very disheartened, really, because I don't think any of the parties know what they're doing,\" Dartford, England, resident Jacqueline Richards, 77, said of her country's election. \"But then looking at yours in America, it's not that great, is it?\"\n\nEvery democratic election is, at its core, about who voters trust to run their country so they can go about running their lives.\n\nDebates are candidate aptitude tests in real time. Thursday's showdown between Biden, 81, and Trump, 77, proved a stark example. Biden's halting performance did the opposite of building confidence, even among some of his supporters. Trump, meanwhile, repeated his lies about the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and his record as president.\n\nThat's only the most recent example of why distrust and resignation dominate the emotional landscape in both countries, according to voters interviewed by The Associated Press in recent weeks. From battleground Wisconsin to bellwether Dartford, voters said years of misinformation, scandal and lies have drained them of the sort of optimism or excitement they might once have felt about the right to vote or the future.\n\nIn Britain, 45% said they \"almost never\" trust governments to put the nation's interest first, up from 34% in 2019, according to a survey published June 12 by the National Centre for Social Research. The pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine War and the country's cost-of-living crisis affected living standards and the economy, it reported. Two Tory prime ministers were ousted. Also, there was Boris Johnson, who resigned rather than be thrown out of Parliament over boozy parties at 10 Downing Street when the nation was under COVID-19 lockdown.\n\n\"They promise and promise and promise and nothing ever changes,\" said Shane Bassett, 34, the bar manager at a pub in Dartford, where the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 is said to have started. \"No matter who gets in -- if it's Labour, if it's Conservative, it's all the same. They all lie.\"\n\nIn the United States, trust has been eroded by deepening political polarization, misinformation and Trump's lies about Biden's victory in the 2020 election -- all amplified by social media.\n\nRoughly 2 in 10 Americans say they trust the U.S. government to do what is right \"just about always\" or \"most of the time,\" according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. About 6 in 10 say they can trust the government \"only some of the time\" and about 2 in 10 say they can never trust the government to do what's right.\n\nNearly three-quarters of American adults blame the news media for dividing the nation, according to a 2023 poll by AP-NORC. Families and friends have learned to avoid discussing politics around Thanksgiving tables and other gatherings. In many places, even celebrations of the Fourth of July -- a national holiday when Americans mark the 1776 ratification of the Declaration of Independence from Britain -- fall under this practice of restraint.\n\nIn Racine, Wisconsin, Rebecca Eisel, 48, wondered how the vast United States, home of 262 million eligible voters and the world's biggest economy, faces a rematch that few Americans wanted.\n\n\"How did our democratic process result in something that the majority of the population doesn't like?\" said Eisel, 48.\n\nThe last time Kathleen Barker, 64, was excited about a candidate, it was Ronald Reagan, who went on to serve two terms in the 1980s and exited office by referring to the country as a \"shining city on a hill.\"\n\n\"You could relate to him,\" she said while walking her dog near the river in Racine. \"He felt like just that average man.\"\n\nNow she says, the \"nasty back and forth\" between Biden and Trump -- who each insist the other is unfit for office -- suggest neither can be trusted to dig into the major problems facing the United States.\n\n\"People are poor. The country is struggling. And this is their focus?\" she said.\n\nEmmanuel McKinstry, a 58-year-old businessperson, voiced similar frustration. The economy, he said while waiting in line to hear Trump speak in Racine, is his top issue. The next morning, McKinstry said he'd still vote for Trump -- with reservations.\n\n\"I'm tired of politicians working for themselves and not really getting down and asking people what we really want,\" McKinstry said. \"We're putting you in office. What are you gonna do for us?\"\n\nIn Britain, the distrust is less personal. It's about scandal -- think Johnson and \"partygate\" -- and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nThat's what concerns Bassett, the manager at the Wat Tyler Pub. You're not supposed to talk about politics in British pubs, he says -- the counterpart, perhaps, of the American reluctance to stir up trouble on the same topic at parties.\n\nBut Bassett looked around at the empty dining room at lunch time. There were no customers to offend. So he let it fly.\n\nThe pub's energy bill last winter jumped from its usual 800 pounds a month (about $1,000) to 1,200 pounds (about $1,500). It has struggled since the Christmas season to bring in customers for a beer. He thinks the owners are likely to sell the place only four years after buying it.\n\n\"I'm not very optimistic,\" he said. \"If I could leave the country, I would.\"",

        "title": "The World Still Needs Habermas",
        "body": "Der Philosoph: Habermas und wir, Philipp Felsch, Propyl\u00e4en Verlag, 256 pp., \u20ac24, February 2024\n\nA new book by Berlin-based cultural historian Philipp Felsch, translated from German simply as The Philosopher with the clever subtitle Habermas and Us, argues that Habermas has always been perfectly in sync with different eras of postwar German political culture. This is a remarkable achievement for someone of his longevity: Habermas turns 95 this year. As Felsch observes, had Michel Foucault lived that long, he could have commented on Donald Trump's presidency; had Hannah Arendt reached that age, she could have extended her reflections on terrorism to 9/11.\n\nIt also makes a confession on the philosopher's part at the end of the book all the more remarkable: Felsch reports that, after adverse reactions to his articles on the Russia-Ukraine war, Habermas feels, for the very first time, as if he no longer understands German public opinion. Has Habermas changed, or is the country changing, turning away from the pacificism and \"post-nationalism\" the philosopher has championed for decades?\n\nIronically, it's Habermas's gift as a writer that often makes it difficult to translate his ideas. Habermas was a freelance journalist before he became an academic, and his public interventions -- always in writing, never on TV or radio -- are stylistically brilliant polemics rich in metaphors. The academic volumes can be hard to translate precisely because suggestive metaphors also do philosophical work.\n\nAmong them is a book originally published in 1962 that, to this day, has sold the most copies of all of Habermas's works. It has an unwieldy title -- The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere -- but its main thesis appears straightforward: Democracy is not just about free and fair elections; it also crucially requires open processes of forming public opinion. In Habermas's stylized account, the 18th century had seen an increasing number of bourgeois readers come together freely to discuss novels in salons and coffeehouses. Eventually, discussions turned to political questions. Whereas monarchs had presented themselves before the people, citizens (at least male and propertied ones) now started to expect states to represent their views and act for them.\n\nIt is often forgotten that Habermas's book tells a story of decline and fall: Capitalism, with its increasing reliance on manipulative advertising techniques, and the rise of a complex administrative state had destroyed a free and open public sphere. Yet, in retrospect, the 1960s would appear to be a golden age of mass media, a point Habermas conceded in a 2022 essay on \"the novel transformation of the public sphere.\" There, he contrasted our era of supposed \"filter bubbles\" and \"post-truth\" with a world characterized by widely respected and economically successful newspapers as well as TV news, around which entire nations could congregate each evening.\n\nAs Felsch notes, the book as well as Habermas's subsequent more philosophical work on communication contained just the right kind of message for a postwar age when West Germans, emerging from the Nazi dictatorship and older traditions of obedience to state authority, began learning how to discuss freely. Like many on the left, Habermas experienced the atmosphere of the early Federal Republic as stultifying: Konrad Adenauer, the rabidly anti-communist chancellor, promised \"no experiments,\" tacitly incorporated former Nazis into the new state, and had little tolerance for a critical press -- let alone critical intellectuals.\n\nToday, the country is characterized by an unusually large number of talk shows on evening TV that receive extensive newspaper commentary the next morning, by public discussion forums that are often subsidized by the state, and by newspapers devoting many columns to weekslong debates among professors. Habermas, contrary to the clich\u00e9 of a rationalist philosopher of deliberation who would ideally like to make parliaments into seminar rooms, has explicitly called for a public sphere that is \"wild\" and in which all kinds of views can be voiced. At the same time, such forums are meant to function like \"sewage treatment plants,\" filtering out false information as well as plainly anti-democratic views.\n\nHabermas's endorsement of liberal democratic procedures -- often derided by Marxists as merely \"formal democracy\" -- made him hostile to postwar intellectual trends in France, which he suspected of promoting irrationalism and an aestheticized politics that lacked all normative standards. Felsch recounts Habermas and Foucault dining together in Paris in an \"icy atmosphere\" in the early 1980s. Apparently, the only real common topic of conversation was German films: Habermas, Felsch tells us, professed his preference for Alexander Kluge's movies dealing with the German past in a reliably pedagogical manner, while Foucault liked Werner Herzog's celebration of \"ecstatic truth\" in his explorations of Africa and Latin America, with the evidently irrational Klaus Kinski in the lead.\n\nIt is not an accident that Habermas has always been careful not to cultivate anything like a traditional German Geniekult, or cult of the towering genius -- nor that he sometimes serves as Exhibit A for French observers who claim that, compared with Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger, contemporary German philosophy has become thoroughly boring, dominated by what French philosopher Gilles Deleuze called \"bureaucrats of pure reason.\"\n\nBut Felsch, who interviewed the philosopher twice in his modernist bungalow in Bavaria, gets Habermas to reveal something surprising: Every single one of his newspaper articles, Habermas claims, was written out of anger. Indeed, rather than being a bureaucrat of pure reason pedantically administering legacies of the Enlightenment, Habermas is best understood as a thoroughly political animal -- even as a somewhat impulsive man, but with reliable left-liberal political instincts. Beyond a general commitment to dialogue and cooperation, his political vision entails an evolution beyond inherited ideas of ethnic nationalism and toward a cosmopolitan international legal order, each aspect of which is now increasingly under threat.\n\nIn the early 1980s, his political impulses led him to a subject he had previously doubted was \"capable of theory\": history. In 1986, in a polemical piece that provoked one of the most important debates in postwar Germany, he accused four historians of trying to \"normalize\" the German past -- as well as the German present. It was crucial, he wrote, to resist any relativization of the Holocaust by conservatives who supposedly thought the Federal Republic should adopt something like a \"normal\" nationalism. Instead, he suggested, Germans might have learned something special from their uniquely problematic past by adopting what Habermas termed \"constitutional patriotism.\" Rather than being proud of cultural traditions and heroic deeds by great national heroes, Germans had learned to take a critical stance vis-\u00e0-vis history, from the vantage point of universal principles enshrined in a liberal democratic constitution.\n\nThis patriotism was often dismissed by conservatives as fit merely for seminar rooms: too abstract and, with a particularly inappropriate metaphor, too \"bloodless.\" Yet there is little doubt that Habermas emerged as the victor in what came to be known as the Historikerstreit, or historians' dispute, and that his suggestion of a \"post-national political culture\" was in fact, if not in name, adopted by ever more German politicians. In the end, Habermas and Adenauer had converged on the same goal: a Germany firmly anchored in the West, except that Habermas began to see it as a possible avant-garde in the move toward a more cosmopolitan future.\n\nThat achievement was put into doubt by the biggest shock to Habermas's political world before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine: the entirely unexpected unification of East and West Germany, overseen by Helmut Kohl, a trained historian who, according to Habermas, had been central to attempts at \"normalizing\" the past. Habermas had been skeptical of unification as long ago as the 1950s, when Social Democrats pushed for overcoming the Cold War division. In 1989, the push for re-creating the German nation-state appeared likely to replace the hard-won achievement of constitutional patriotism with ethnic nationalism.\n\nSubsequently, Habermas became a fervent supporter of European integration. In the late 1970s, he was still saying he was \"not a fan of Europe,\" since what was then called the European Economic Community had been initiated by Christian Democrats such as Adenauer and operated mostly as a common market. But the European Union became a kind of political life insurance policy for those anxious about any post-Cold War resurgence of German nationalism. To the extent that Europe would become a polity, it seemed reasonable to think that the community, with its variety of national cultures, would have to be one held together by abstract political principles -- a European constitutional patriotism of sorts. In the early 2000s, Habermas, together with then-Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of the German Greens, campaigned for a European constitution -- an effort that turned out to be a failure.\n\nHabermas also came to think that Europe's identity could be defined by its commitment to international law -- and as a counterweight in that way to a United States that, after 9/11, appeared to lose its normative bearings. In 2003, he co-wrote a passionate appeal for European unity with Jacques Derrida, an erstwhile philosophical adversary whom Habermas suspected of irrationalism and conservative tendencies, like so many French theorists. Europe was to define itself as law-abiding and humane, on account of its welfare states -- in opposition to George W. Bush's America breaking through the shackles of international law. The hubris of U.S. neoconservatives proved a personal disappointment for an intellectual who had formative stints in the United States ever since first being welcomed to New York by Arendt.\n\nAnother central part of Habermas's proposed European identity was a commitment to pacifism. Felsch argues convincingly that Habermas has remained remarkably consistent in his pacifist instincts: as an opponent of rearming the Bundeswehr in the 1950s, as a critic of the Vietnam War in the '60s, and as an advocate for those blockading sites where nuclear-capable missiles had been stationed in the early 1980s. (Habermas had been the first prominent theorist to justify civil disobedience in a country where law-breaking in the name of moral principles seemed deeply suspect.)\n\nAt the same time, Felsch reminds us that Habermas justified all of Germany's crucial foreign-policy decisions of the post-unification period: its support for the Gulf War, its participation in the intervention in Kosovo, the refusal of the Social Democratic-Green government to join the United States' \"coalition of the willing\" in 2002. For Habermas, a war was justifiable as long as it foreshadowed a cosmopolitan legal order, which left plenty of room for interpretation. (That seemed at least a somewhat plausible account for military action authorized by the United Nations; it was a much harder case to make for NATO's bombing of Belgrade in 1999.)\n\nBut the room for interpretation in Habermas's framework seems not to be able to accommodate the ways that war in Ukraine is now changing political culture in Germany and Europe. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Habermas wrote in the center-left S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung in support of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's cautious approach to supplying military aid. Habermas had always been close to Scholz's Social Democratic Party; its leaders sought his advice, though he would on occasion also pressure them to rethink what he regarded as mistaken policies, such as the diktat of austerity during the European debt crisis. And there had long been a connection between certain factions of the party and the philosopher in their shared affinity for anti-militarism.\n\nYet Habermas's call for negotiations with Moscow in 2023 was widely attacked, including by some on the left. Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrii Melnyk tweeted that his interventions constituted a \"disgrace for German philosophy.\" Germany, like much of Europe, had arrived at a new political imperative prompted by Zeitenwende -- Scholz's phrase for the major turning point in history marked by a recommitment to military self-defense. For Habermas, who has always argued that politics should err on the side of seeking peace and mutual understanding, this turn has been impossible to support. By the book's end, Habermas confesses to Felsch that he no longer understands the reactions of the German public.\n\nBut Felsch suggests that if Habermas's legacy is indeed slipping away, it has less to do with the way Habermas has changed than the way the world around him has. Habermas's fears of a more nationalist Germany appear confirmed with a rising far right that flaunts its historical revisionism in ways unimaginable after the Historikerstreit. The EU is hardly a paragon of post-nationalism, its aspirations to be a global \"normative power\" in shambles -- it cannot even get its act together in stopping far-right leaders such as Hungary's Viktor Orban from undermining liberal democracy. The hopes for a cosmopolitan legal order have been dashed in a new age of great-power rivalries. To be sure, Habermas had never committed to anything remotely resembling an end-of-history thesis, but his basic impulse that a world of freundliches Zusammenleben -- friendly coexistence -- was a realistic utopia has certainly been called into question.\n\nYet it would be wrong to conclude that Habermas's thought only made sense in the \"safe space\" of bygone West Germany. The case for something like constitutional patriotism is, if anything, more urgent in the face of a resurgent hard right. The EU is failing in all sorts of ways, but its structures remain available for politically and morally more ambitious undertakings. (Evidently, Habermas has failed to persuade German leaders to take up French President Emmanuel Macron's invitation to build a sovereign Europe.) As disillusioned as Habermas is with the United States -- long the tacit guarantor of his worldview, one is tempted to say -- the best of its universalist founding ideals have hardly been invalidated.\n\nHabermas was never like certain naive liberals of the '90s: History does not simply prove ideas right or wrong; rather, history is an ongoing fight in the wilderness of the public sphere. The task for intellectuals is not to be either optimistic or pessimistic, which was the way for old-style anti-modern thinkers in Germany to prove depth. Instead, it is to be and to stay irritable.",

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls opened at 6am and will close at 4pm in small towns and cities, with a 6pm finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round on July 7 are expected.\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36 per cent of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31 per cent and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23 per cent.However the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting next Sunday.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nAt a voting station in Sevres, on the outskirts of Paris, 70-year-old former company director Didier Delacroix said he had voted for Macron's alliance.\n\n\"Otherwise it'll be a complete mess,\" he said.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5 per cent of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.",

France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.\n\n(Additional reporting by Paris bureauWriting by Estelle ShirbonEditing by Frances Kerry and Gareth Jones)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

        "summary": "French voters began casting ballots in a snap parliamentary election that could potentially bring the far-right National Rally (RN) to power for the first time since World War II. President Emmanuel Macron called the election after his centrist alliance was defeated by Marine Le Pen's RN in recent European elections. Polls suggest RN leads with 33-36% of the vote, followed by a left-wing coalition at 28-31%, and Macron's alliance at 20-23%. If RN wins, it could lead to significant political turbulence, with potential shifts in France's EU stance and its position on the Russia-Ukraine war. The final outcome will be determined after the second round of voting on July 7.",

        "body": "DARTFORD, England (AP) -- Distrust has settled over the campaign trails in the United States and United Kingdom ahead of July 4 like a soggy summer haze.\n\nOn that day, British voters will choose a new Parliament in an election expected to finish with a Labour government after 14 years under the Conservatives. Americans, polarized by the rematch between Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, will mark Independence Day in something resembling unity with barbeques and fireworks ahead of their vote on Nov. 5.\n\nThere's much to celebrate on the Fourth of July for the world's biggest democracy and the venerable kingdom that gave rise to it, 248 years after they split and set off on slow, troubled journeys toward granting all citizens the right to vote. Both remain rooted in the Magna Carta, the English document signed in 1215. It set in writing the idea that leaders -- including kings, presidents and their governments -- are not above the law. The nations have become close friends and stalwart allies.\n\n\"I'm just very disheartened, really, because I don't think any of the parties know what they're doing,\" Dartford, England, resident Jacqueline Richards, 77, said of her country's election. \"But then looking at yours in America, it's not that great, is it?\"\n\nEvery democratic election is, at its core, about who voters trust to run their country so they can go about running their lives.\n\nDebates are candidate aptitude tests in real time. Thursday's showdown between Biden, 81, and Trump, 77, proved a stark example. Biden's halting performance did the opposite of building confidence, even among some of his supporters. Trump, meanwhile, repeated his lies about the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and his record as president.\n\nThat's only the most recent example of why distrust and resignation dominate the emotional landscape in both countries, according to voters interviewed by The Associated Press in recent weeks. From battleground Wisconsin to bellwether Dartford, England, voters said years of misinformation, scandal and lies have drained them of the sort of optimism or excitement they might once have felt about the right to vote or the future.\n\nIn Britain, 45% said they \"almost never\" trust governments to put the nation's interest first, up from 34% in 2019, according to a survey published June 12 by the National Centre for Social Research. The pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine War and the country's cost-of-living crisis affected living standards and the economy, it reported. Two Tory prime ministers were ousted. Also, there was Boris Johnson, who resigned rather than be thrown out of Parliament over boozy parties at 10 Downing Street when the nation was under COVID-19 lockdown.\n\n\"They promise and promise and promise and nothing ever changes,\" said Shane Bassett, 34, the bar manager at a pub in bellwether Dartford, England, where the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 is said to have started. \"No matter who gets in -- if it's Labour, if it's Conservative, it's all the same. They all lie.\"\n\nIn the United States, trust has been eroded by deepening political polarization, misinformation and Trump's lies about Biden's victory in the 2020 election -- all amplified by social media.\n\nRoughly 2 in 10 Americans say they trust the U.S. government to do what is right \"just about always\" or \"most of the time,\" according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. About 6 in 10 say they can trust the government \"only some of the time\" and about 2 in 10 say they can never trust the government to do what's right.\n\nNearly three-quarters of American adults blame the news media for dividing the nation, according to a 2023 poll by AP-NORC. Families and friends have learned to avoid discussing politics around Thanksgiving tables and other gatherings. In many places, even celebrations of the Fourth of July -- a national holiday when Americans mark the 1776 ratification of the Declaration of Independence from Britain -- fall under this practice of restraint.\n\nIn Racine, Wis., Rebecca Eisel, 48, wondered how the vast United States, home of 262 million eligible voters and the world's biggest economy, faces a rematch that few Americans wanted.\n\n\"How did our democratic process result in something that the majority of the population doesn't like?\" said Eisel, 48.\n\nThe last time Kathleen Barker, 64, was excited about a candidate, it was Ronald Reagan, who went on to serve two terms in the 1980s and exited office by referring to the country as a \"shining city on a hill.\"\n\n\"You could relate to him,\" she said while walking her dog near the river in Racine. \"He felt like just that average man.\"\n\nNow she says, the \"nasty back and forth\" between Biden and Trump -- who each insist the other is unfit for office -- suggest neither can be trusted to dig into the major problems facing the United States.\n\n\"People are poor. The country is struggling. And this is their focus?\" she said.\n\nEmmanuel McKinstry, a 58-year-old businessperson, voiced similar frustration. The economy, he said while waiting in line to hear Trump speak in Racine, is his top issue. The next morning, McKinstry said he'd still vote for Trump -- with reservations.\n\n\"I'm tired of politicians working for themselves and not really getting down and asking people what we really want,\" McKinstry said. \"We're putting you in office. What are you gonna do for us?\"\n\nIn Britain, the distrust is less personal. It's about scandal -- think Johnson and \"partygate\" -- and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nThat's what concerns Bassett, the manager at the Wat Tyler Pub. You're not supposed to talk about politics in British pubs, he says -- the counterpart, perhaps, of the American reluctance to stir up trouble on the same topic at parties.\n\nBut Bassett looked around at the empty dining room at lunch time. There were no customers to offend. So he let it fly.\n\nThe pub's energy bill last winter jumped from its usual 800 pounds a month (about $1,000) to 1,200 pounds (about $1,500). It has struggled since the Christmas season to bring in customers for a quality, 4.50 beer. He thinks the owners are likely to sell the place only four years after buying it.\n\n\"I'm not very optimistic,\" he said. \"If I could leave the country, I would.\"\n\nFernando reported from Racine, Wisconsin.

It's about scandal -- think Johnson and \"partygate\" -- and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nOn May 22, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had good news and a bombshell: Inflation was down to 2.3% for the first time in three years, and he was dissolving Parliament immediately, which started a clock that required an election on July 4.\n\nBut the visuals are what's remembered about that day. Rain soaked his suited shoulders as Sunak spoke where his predecessors had stood for 275 years, before the iconic black door of No. 10 Downing Street. No one sheltered him with an umbrella.

Americans across the pond, deeply polarized by the rematch between Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, will mark Independence Day in something resembling unity with barbeques and fireworks ahead of their vote on Nov. 5.\n\nThere's much to celebrate on the Fourth of July for the world's biggest democracy and the venerable kingdom that gave rise to it, 248 years after they split and set off on slow, troubled journeys toward granting all citizens the right to vote. Both remain rooted in the Magna Carta, the English document signed in 1215. It set in writing the idea that leaders -- including kings, presidents and their governments -- are not above the law. The nations have become close friends and stalwart allies.\n\n\"I'm just very disheartened, really, because I don't think any of the parties know what they're doing,\" Dartford, England, resident Jacqueline Richards, 77, said of her country's election. \"But then looking at yours in America, it's not that great, is it?\"\n\nTrust has taken a beating in both countries\n\nEvery democratic election is, at its core, about who voters trust to run their country so they can go about running their lives.\n\nDebates are candidate aptitude tests in real time, never more so than during Thursday's showdown between Biden, 81, and Trump, 77. Biden's halting performance did the opposite of building confidence, even among some of his most loyal supporters. Trump, meanwhile, repeated his lies about the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and his record as president.\n\nThat's only the most recent example of why distrust and a sense of resignation dominate the emotional landscape in both countries, according to voters interviewed by The Associated Press in recent weeks. From battleground Wisconsin to bellwether Dartford, England, voters said years of misinformation, scandal and lies have drained them of the sort of optimism or excitement they might once have felt about the right to vote or the future.\n\nIn Britain, 45% said they \"almost never\" trust governments to put the nation's interest first, up from 34% in 2019, according to a survey published June 12 by the National Centre for Social Research. The pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine War and the country's cost-of-living crisis affected living standards and the economy, it reported. Two Tory prime ministers were ousted. Also, there was Boris Johnson, who resigned rather than be thrown out of Parliament over boozy parties at 10 Downing Street when the nation was under COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nA vote to turn the Conservative government out of power is not necessarily a vote for Labour, opposition leader Keir Starmer acknowledged during a May 27 debate. Voters, he said, \"still have questions about us: Has Labour changed enough? Do I trust them with my money, our borders, our security?\"\n\nStarmer's own answer was yes, of course. But British voters told the AP in the weeks before the election that they're far from sure.\n\n\"They promise and promise and promise and nothing ever changes,\" said Shane Bassett, 34, the bar manager at a pub in bellwether Dartford, England, where the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 is said to have started. \"No matter who gets in -- if it's Labour, if it's Conservative, it's all the same. They all lie.\"\n\nIn the United States, trust has been eroded by deepening political polarization, misinformation and Trump's lies about Biden's victory in the 2020 election -- all amplified by social media.\n\nRoughly 2 in 10 Americans say they trust the U.S. government to do what is right \"just about always\" or \"most of the time,\" according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. About 6 in 10 say they can trust the government \"only some of the time\" and about 2 in 10 say they can never trust the government to do what's right.\n\nNearly three-quarters of American adults blame the news media for dividing the nation, according to a 2023 poll by AP-NORC. Families and friends have learned to avoid discussing politics around Thanksgiving tables and other gatherings. In many places, even celebrations of the Fourth of July -- a national holiday when Americans mark the 1776 ratification of the Declaration of Independence from Britain -- fall under this practice of restraint.\n\nIn Racine, Wis., Rebecca Eisel, 48, wondered how the vast United States, home of 262 million eligible voters and the world's biggest economy, faces a rematch that few Americans wanted.\n\n\"How did our democratic process result in something that the majority of the population doesn't like?\" Eisel, 48, said over a sandwich at the Maple Table restaurant.\n\nThe United States: 'The country is struggling'\n\nThe last time Kathleen Barker, 64, was excited about a candidate, it was Ronald Reagan, who went on to serve two terms in the 1980s and exited office by referring to the country as a \"shining city on a hill.\"\n\n\"He was a very real person, very respectful, family-oriented,\" she said while walking her dog near the river in Racine. \"You could relate to him. He felt like just that average man.\"\n\nNow, she says, the \"nasty back-and-forth\" between Biden and Trump -- who each insist the other is unfit for office -- suggest neither can be trusted to dig into the major problems facing the United States.\n\n\"People are poor. The country is struggling. And this is their focus?\" she said.\n\nEmmanuel McKinstry, a 58-year-old businessperson, voiced similar frustration. The economy, he said while waiting in line to hear Trump speak in Racine, is his top issue. The next morning, McKinstry said he'd still vote for Trump -- with reservations.\n\n\"I'm tired of politicians working for themselves and not really getting down and asking people what we really want,\" McKinstry said. \"We're putting you in office. What are you gonna do for us?\"\n\nThe last presidential candidate to excite high school teacher Marcus T. West, 49, was Democrat Barack Obama, who went on to serve two terms.\n\n\"He got the importance of educators. He had good intentions,\" West said over breakfast at Mrs. Betty's Kitchen. \"He's the last person I felt talked like me, talked to me, passed policies that I liked.\"\n\nThis year, he said of Biden and Trump, \"they aren't looking out for us.\"\n\nOn May 22, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had good news and a bombshell: Inflation was down to 2.3% for the first time in three years, and he was dissolving Parliament immediately, which started a clock that required an election on July 4.\n\nBut the visuals are what's remembered about that day. Rain soaked his suited shoulders as Sunak spoke where his predecessors had stood for 275 years, before the iconic black door of No. 10 Downing Street. No one sheltered him with an umbrella. Protesters nearly drowned out his words by playing \"Things Can Only Get Better,\" a rival Labour campaign song used in the Tony Blair era.\n\n\"Things can only get wetter,\" led the reports on several news sites.\n\nThat's what concerns Bassett, the manager at the Wat Tyler Pub, named for a leader of the Peasants' Revolt that started on that site. You're not supposed to talk about politics in British pubs, he says -- the counterpart, perhaps, of the American reluctance to stir up trouble on the same topic at parties.\n\nBut Bassett looked around at the empty dining room at lunch time. There were no customers to offend. So he let it fly.\n\nThe pub's energy bill last winter jumped from its usual 800 pounds a month (about $1,000) to 1,200 pounds (about $1,500). It has struggled since the Christmas season to bring in customers for a quality, 4.50 beer. He thinks the owners are likely to sell the place only four years after buying it.\n\n\"I'm not very optimistic.\" he said. Thinking of his family members in Canada, Bassett added: \"If I could leave the country, I would.\"\n\n___\n\nFernando reported from Racine, Wisconsin.

West, 49, was Democrat Barack Obama, who went on to serve two terms.\n\n\"He got the importance of educators. He had good intentions,\" West said over breakfast at Mrs. Betty's Kitchen. \"He's the last person I felt talked like me, talked to me, passed policies that I liked.\"\n\nThis year, he said of Biden and Trump, \"they aren't looking out for us.\"\n\nBritain: 'Not very optimistic'\n\nIn Britain, the distrust is less personal. It's about scandal -- think Johnson and \"partygate\" -- and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nOn May 22, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had good news and a bombshell: Inflation was down to 2.3% for the first time in three years, and he was dissolving Parliament immediately, which started a clock that required an election on July 4.\n\nBut the visuals are what's remembered about that day. Rain soaked his suited shoulders as Sunak spoke where his predecessors had stood for 275 years, before the iconic black door of No. 10 Downing Street. No one sheltered him with an umbrella. Protesters nearly drowned out his words by playing \"Things Can Only Get Better,\" a rival Labour campaign song used in the Tony Blair era.\n\n\"Things can only get wetter,\" led the reports on several news sites.\n\nThat's what concerns Bassett, the manager at the Wat Tyler Pub, named for a leader of the Peasants' Revolt that started on that site. You're not supposed to talk about politics in British pubs, he says -- the counterpart, perhaps, of the American reluctance to stir up trouble on the same topic at parties.\n\nBut Bassett looked around at the empty dining room at lunch time. There were no customers to offend. So he let it fly.\n\nThe pub's energy bill last winter jumped from its usual 800 pounds a month (about $1,000) to 1,200 pounds (about $1,500). It has struggled since the Christmas season to bring in customers for a quality, 4.50 beer. He thinks the owners are likely to sell the place only four years after buying it.\n\n\"I'm not very optimistic.\" he said. Thinking of his family members in Canada, Bassett added: \"If I could leave the country, I would.\"\n\n___\n\nFernando reported from Racine, Wisconsin.

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls open at 0600 GMT, closing at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, and at 1800 GMT in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.\n\n(Additional reporting by Paris bureau; Writing by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Frances Kerry)",

        "body": "NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg proposed sanctioning China over its support for Russia amid the Russia-Ukraine war. Unlike the West, China has not directly provided countless aid packages to Russia, but China has kept trade open and exchanged technology with Moscow. Stoltenberg believes China must face \"consequences\" for not aligning with NATO.\n\nThe West is theoretically not at war with Russia or China. NATO is on the offensive, completely stepping over boundaries and harassing foreign nations to instigate World War III. Then they tell the public and mainstream media to announce that they are merely protecting their own people from our enemies who have done absolutely nothing to earn such a title.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nUnder this line of thinking, the NATO alliance could punish anyone who dissents from their global autocratic authority. \"Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point -- and unless China changes course -- allies need to impose a cost. There should be consequences,\" Stoltenberg said at the Wilson Center in Washington. He honed in on China trading microelectronics with Russia that has improved Russia's satellite proficiencies. China and Russia have agreed to an open partnership, yet China is not involved in this war.\n\nShould NATO also punish India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and others for continuing to trade with Russia? NATO has absolutely no authority to demand that other nations shun Russia from the global economy. They know that these proposed sanctions would not deter China from conducting business with Russia. Instead, these \"consequences\" will cause China and all other non-NATO nations to back away from trading with the West entirely. Will they do the same to nations who continue to trade with China once they redirect their focus to Taiwan? Will they force \"consequences\" upon nations who do not support Israel?\n\nThe Neocons are decimating the economies of western nations by deterring trade. There is no common sense in the boardrooms as the only objective is to fan the flames of war by any means necessary. China already stepped away from Western trade in a major way and now they are actively provoking China to take retaliatory measures.\n\nNATO has zero reason to back Ukraine on paper as it is not a member. They do not plan to offer Ukraine membership at the upcoming Washington summit, but Stoltenberg said they will place the framework to \"build a bridge\" to future membership. Stoltenberg congratulated NATO members for contributing more to the alliance this year than ever before. This global force is a danger to civilization itself as it aims to propel us into a global conflict from which there will be no turning back.",

        "body": "Joe Biden, in this week's presidential debate with President Donald Trump, revealed himself as unfocused, uncomprehending, unable to express his thoughts, unable to track a line of argument, unable to remember facts, and unwilling to step aside.\n\nHe also did something else: Made the world a lot less safe.\n\nIt is John Daniel Davidson, who wrote at The Federalist of the new, enhanced threat.\n\nHe said while the \"chatter\" was all about what the Democrats will do for a 2024 candidate, \"now that the president has shown himself to be unfit for office,\" there's another issue.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

Whomever is calling the shots in the White House, especially on foreign affairs, it isn't Biden. While it's true that much of American governance has devolved into the hands of an unelected (and unaccountable) administrative bureaucracy, when it comes to foreign policy and decisions about how to respond to crises overseas, the president still plays an important and arguably indispensable role,\" Davidson explained.\n\nHowever, he noted, \"Our current president, as the entire world now knows, cannot follow the train of his own thoughts. He seems to have only a tenuous grasp on reality. He can barely walk down a few steps. Clearly, he's not the one in charge of the White House, which means the presidency itself is remarkably weak right now. That in turn means the world is a much more dangerous place after last night, because America's adversaries know they have a narrow window to exploit the obvious weakness of our executive branch while Biden is still in office.\"\n\nThe danger, then, he explained, isn't what \"fallout\" there might be from the debate. \"It might be actual fallout.\"\n\nHe explained, \"Right now there are multiple hot conflicts around the world -- and not just low-level coups in small countries like Bolivia and Kenya. Israel is essentially at war with Iran. The Russia-Ukraine war rages on, no end in sight. And China could launch an invasion of Taiwan any day. These are dangerous times even without a dementia-addled 81-year-old in the White House. But the extent of Biden's decline has made it even more dangerous.\n\n\"To be clear, Biden has been unfit for office for years at this point. But the public spectacle of the debate gave a new urgency to a reality that our establishment media and political classes have been denying for a while now. Simply put, the debate made it undeniable that Biden is in a state of rapid decline. He can barely string a sentence together or keep track of what he's talking about. There is no way to spin it. The entire world saw the reality of our situation last night.\"\n\nIn contrast, he explained, was Trump.\n\n\"Cogent, forceful, and clear-eyed about the threats we face abroad and what he'll do about them,\" Davidson explained.\n\nIt was former deputy national security adviser for Trump K.T. McFarland who brought up the point that Iran, China and Russia, and others, \"realize they have a harrowing window of opportunity to exploit U.S. weakness.\"\n\nAlso there are key differences in the foreign policies pursued by Trump and Biden. Under Trump, Moscow didn't attack Ukraine and there was peace in the Middle East. Not so under Biden.\n\nThe differences, he said, are noted by \"our adversaries.\"\n\n\"They know it will be much harder to pursue their strategic aims during a second Trump administration for the simple reason that Trump's foreign policy is guided by nationalism in a way that Biden's is not,\" he said.\n\nAfter the debate, he warned, \"the entire world knows we don't have a competent commander in chief. We don't even have a president.\"\n\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

John Daniel Davidson from The Federalist argues that Biden's apparent cognitive decline makes the world more dangerous, as adversaries like Iran, China, and Russia may exploit perceived U.S. weakness. The article contrasts Biden's foreign policy with Trump's, claiming that Trump's approach was more effective in maintaining global stability. Former Trump adviser K.T.

        "title": "The Democrats are panicking: Biden could bring the whole party down",
        "body": "The stunning results of Thursday's presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump are reverberating around the United States, with the full consequences yet unseen. At the moment, Democrats are seriously considering, finally, whether to dump Biden as their prospective presidential nominee. Without drastic, nearly unprecedented action now, they may be on the way not only to losing the White House, but to significant losses in Senate, House, state and local races as well. Without the incentive to turn out, many Democratic voters might simply stay at home, with enormous down-ballot consequences.\n\nTrump had less at stake in the debate because opinions about him, pro and con, are well-established and hard to change. Biden is equally well-known, but nagging doubts about his mental acuity meant he had enormous downside risk if the debate aggravated those doubts. That is precisely what happened. Trump was no altar boy, just his usual boastful, bragging, prevaricating self, but Biden's performance panicked his fellow Democrats. How many will want to risk jumping off the cliff with him leading their ticket?\n\nThese potentially tectonic political consequences overshadowed the substantive debate, especially on national security issues. Repeatedly, however, Trump took positions that would be seriously wrong if implemented as policy. Biden attempted to defend his record, which needs a lot of defending, leaving the queasy feeling that neither man is really fit to be president.\n\nTake Afghanistan. In the debate's opening minutes, the two candidates tangled on the issue, with both ducking responsibility for US withdrawal. Biden said he was this century's only president without Americans in combat overseas, and criticised Trump for having US forces \"still killing people in Afghanistan\" on his watch. In fact, withdrawal was a joint Trump-Biden effort: Trump negotiated surrendering Afghanistan to the Taliban, and Biden implemented it. There is plenty of blame for both. Trump rightly slammed Biden's 2021 implementation of the departure, exemplified by the debacle at Kabul airport, saying, \"no general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country...\" Overstated, but not by much.\n\nTrump admitted he also wanted out, but claimed \"we were getting out with dignity, with strength, with power\". This typical Trump bluster saw action throughout the evening. He also repeatedly attacked Biden for his international image, asserting \"we're no longer respected as a country. They don't respect our leadership.\"\n\nClaiming Biden was weak didn't deter Trump from also calling him a warmonger: \"These are wars that will never end with him. He will drive us into World War Three and we're closer to World War Three than anybody can imagine... President Xi of China, Kim Jong Un of North Korea, all of these - Putin - they don't respect him. They don't fear him.\" In Trump's surreal world, all of this makes sense.\n\nInterestingly, China was lightly discussed, but Trump raised it first during the Afghanistan discussion. He rejected the idea that his proposed 10 per cent across-the-board tariffs will increase US consumer prices, saying it would force countries like China \"that have been ripping us off for years ... to pay us a lot of money ... and give us a lot of power for other things\". Trump currently talks tough on Beijing because he believes the Covid pandemic, originating in China, cost him the 2020 election. How long this would last if Xi paid him a post-election congratulatory call is unknowable.\n\nUsing China as a hook to offset his recent felony convictions, Trump assaulted Biden's behaviour, portraying him as a criminal. Trump absurdly said Biden \"gets paid by China. He's a Manchurian Candidate,\" which apparently \"explains\" why Biden is afraid to take tough stands against Xi. Unsurprisingly, the debate produced immediate concern among Asian observers, who saw it live Friday morning their time.\n\nOn Ukraine, Trump continued claiming that, had he been president, Russia never would have invaded (again unprovable but also irrefutable). He pledged to resolve the Russia-Ukraine war as president-elect, even before being inaugurated next January 20.\n\nBiden defended his record, and Trump complained endlessly about how much money the United States had spent on Ukraine compared to Europe, which always strikes a chord with Trump's base, along with his familiar complaints about Nato spending levels.\n\nTurning to the Middle East, Trump, on cue, asserted that Hamas would not have attacked Israel had he been president. He argued that anti-Iran sanctions imposed after the US withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018 had essentially broken Iran financially. Sadly, that claim is far from reality. Certainly, Biden's relaxation of sanctions enforcement has allowed Iran's international oil sales to rebound significantly, but Iran was still funding terrorism and nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes during Trump's term.\n\nNever missing an opportunity for personal insult, Trump said Biden should \"let [Israel] finish the job. He doesn't want to do it. He's become like a Palestinian.\" Really.\n\nThe coming days will determine whether Biden survives as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Even if he does, however, it is harder than before to deny he is in serious, potentially fatal political trouble - and at a time when the free world has rarely been in greater need of effective leadership.",

        "summary": "The recent presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump has caused significant concern among Democrats, who are now contemplating whether to replace Biden as their nominee. Biden's performance, which raised doubts about his mental acuity, has led to fears of not only losing the White House but also suffering substantial losses in Senate, House, state, and local races due to decreased voter turnout.\n\nDuring the debate, Trump maintained his usual boastful demeanor, while Biden struggled to defend his record, particularly on national security issues. Both candidates avoided taking full responsibility for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, with Trump criticizing Biden's handling of the 2021 departure and Biden pointing out ongoing U.S. military actions during Trump's term.\n\nTrump attacked Biden's international image, labeling him both weak and a warmonger, and accused him of being compromised by China. He also claimed that under his leadership, Russia would not have invaded Ukraine and that Hamas would not have attacked Israel. Trump's assertions included familiar complaints about NATO spending and U.S. financial support for Ukraine.\n\nThe debate has left Democrats questioning Biden's viability as a candidate, with the potential for significant political repercussions if he remains on the ticket. The situation underscores the urgent need for effective leadership amid global challenges.",

        "title": "As DeSantis cuts arts funding, tax revenues will go down, tourists will stay away | Letters",
        "body": "Gov. DeSantis has eviscerated funding for the arts and culture in one uncaring slash. Studies have shown that for every $1 spent on arts and culture programs, $9 more in related spending is generated. Restaurants, hotels and businesses are the beneficiaries of Florida Rep's location in Fort Myers' River District. Tax revenues will go down, tourists will stay away, many jobs will be lost, and some nonprofit organizations will be forced to close.\n\nThe Tony-winning playwright of \"Stereophonic\" recently said, \"It's really hard to make a career in the arts, we need to fund the arts in America. It is the hallmark of a civilized society.\"\n\nDeSantis' veto of all arts funding for Naples and Bonita reveals the level of degradation of this man. Three quotes from your reporter's article verify it well.\n\n\"This veto is not just a budgetary decision. It is a blatant disregard for thousands of jobs, the educational opportunities and the community enrichment that arts and culture provide.\"\n\n\"Funding arts and culture is not a handout. It's an investment in the economic future of a community.\"\n\n\"This is not just about numbers on a balance sheet. It's about real people - artists, educators, families, and audiences - who rely on these funds to create and experience the transformative power of the arts. Gov. DeSantis' decision is an outright betrayal of the values that uphold our society, and it is a disservice to every Floridian who believes in the importance of culture, creativity and community.\"\n\nGovernor DeSantis, you could be the hero of our communities if you reversed your decision to cancel funds for the various projects that create entertainment for folks and development of artists. We, as taxpayers benefit hugely from having our money help support the arts.\n\nRe: Arts groups stunned after DeSantis slashes $32M. Why is anyone surprised, let alone stunned? Most, although not all Republican politicians are solely interested in their wealthy cohorts. The fact that this veto will impact thousands of \"artists\" does not concern our governor. If you keep voting this way, for these people, our quality of life will continue to change for the worse. We've seen it in our environment, our cultural institutions, our educational systems, and our societal mores.\n\nCan't you hear the chip, chip, chip eating away at what once was?\n\nIn January of 2024, Bloomberg Foundation designated funding $250 million for health high schools as a partnership between public schools and local hospitals as the first step in educating students for health care careers or foundational for continuing education to licensed positions. The Lee County Medicare age population is percentage-wise larger than the national average, exacerbating the health care workforce shortage.\n\nThe Lee County Commission as part of considering approval of Lee Health, a public hospital conversion to not-for-profit status could conditionally stipulate Lee Health in conjunction with Lee County Public Schools establish a formal health high school on the campus of a Lee Health facility akin to the Bloomberg model.\n\nWhat a mess! Based on Thursday's \"Debate,\" our options for the next president are either a slow old man or a pathological liar with no morals. We can thank both the Republican and Democratic parties and our inept congressional leaders for this mess.\n\nWhile I am disappointed in the recent presidential debate, I did notice that every time a direct question was asked of Trump in regard to his policy or past actions he changed the topic and avoided answering. His responses were mostly canned lies from his rallies. He denied what Americans saw and heard with their own eyes. So many of his statements were in reference to events we watched on the news - we saw the nazi rally in Charlottesville and heard Trump call both \"many fine people.\" He denied calling military personnel \"suckers and losers\" and instead called General Kelly a liar. We watched in horror at the 1/6 attacks and prayed repeatedly for Trump to come make a statement against it, yet he claimed once again it was Pelosi's fault. He didn't answer when asked if he condemned those who stormed the Capitol and complained that the rioters had their jobs ruined because they were punished for committing those acts! Most importantly, he refused to say he would abide by the next election results. And, he was proud to take away a woman's right to choice and claimed abortions happen for 2-3 days after birth! A ridiculous statement.\n\nThe lies were coming fast and furious and Biden, who was apparently dealing with a cold, couldn't respond forcefully enough. His cold made him sound weak as he tried to rebut some lies while also calmly presenting some of his policy accomplishments.\n\nOn actually answering questions on policy Trump failed. On giving honest answers and offering substance, Biden won. Many pundits will judge based on perceptions, but the substance given in Biden's answers is what matters most. I'll take honesty over showmanship anytime.\n\nI know there will be a lot of discussion about the debate. Biden did this or Trump lied about that. But this misses the bigger picture and I hope people will realize it. When the Hur report came out and said Biden will come across as an old man with a poor memory and therefore won't be prosecuted, the Democrats and the administration insisted he was alert and spry behind closed doors. Many people have been saying for years that Biden is not fit to be in charge of the nuclear codes so it shouldn't be news to anyone in DC. But all the discussion about the debate, Biden, Trump, etc. misses the point. The Democrat Party and the Biden White House have attempted to pull of the biggest charade in American political history by putting a cognitively compromised person in office and lying about it. Although people have their suspicions, no one actually knows who is in really in charge of the country. Even if Biden steps aside, the Democrat Party should never be trusted to hold power again. If EVER there was a threat to democracy.\n\nFor the past three and one-half years we have witnessed the physical and mental decline of Joe Biden. We know what we see and hear. Almost everyone has an aging parent, friend, or relative that has suffered a similar decline. It's not funny. It's sad. Most recently his spokespersons claimed that what we were seeing and hearing were some type of artificial intelligence and diabolical \"cheap fakes.\" I assume that what we all witnessed and heard in this most recent presidential debate will put an end to any such speculation. Hopefully Mr. Biden can get the help he needs.John Mcwilliams, Fort Myers\n\nTrove of wisdom\n\nThe effects of aging aren't superficially attractive, especially to our ageist culture.But wisdom acquired by empaths, like Biden, from multiple decades of life's experiences are treasure troves of brilliant jewels inside tattered and time-worn chests.To reject or disregard the treasures inside time-worn chests is the epitome of foolishness.\n\nCongressman Byron Donalds embarrassed himself and all of us, his constituents, in an interview on BBC America prior to the presidential debate on June 27. Give him credit for memorizing all the MAGA talking points, but what a pack of lies! The most offensive, in this writer's mind, was the lie that Trump was not made aware of the charges against him in the recent fraud trial and that Manhattan AG Alvin Bragg was somehow in cahoots with the Biden campaign. Shockingly ignorant of state vs federal laws!\n\nSo, when did the Republican Party, long entrenched in law and order, become so anti-law and order?When Donald Trump and his consiglieres, capos and street thugs came to power, that's when.House Republicans want convicted criminal Steve Bannon's prison sentence dropped.Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson agrees with Trump's plan to pardon all the thugs who beat hell out of Capitol cops.Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he supports criminal Trump's run for president.Convicted Criminal-in-Chief Trump himself has said he'll jail the prosecutors who convicted him if he's elected.Trump's congressional Cosa Nostra relishes law and order when paddy wagons fill with Blacks and immigrants but not when their white armies of the night are taking the ride.They're the worst of hypocrites, bigots feeding at our public trough and writing our laws.\n\nIn the past decade, we have witnessed the social collapse of many countries, including my own, Venezuela, and the rise of autocratic regimes. This has coincided with dysfunctional governments led by opportunistic populist leaders seeking power, which has caused distrust among populations and our governments. This distrust has led to weakened institutions that are corrupt and unable to govern effectively, exacerbating the gap between governments and the people they are supposed to serve.To address this catastrophic trend of chaos, we need to reconnect with the principle that governments are for the people and by the people, rooting these efforts in civic engagement and public participation. We must work with governments at all levels, collaborating where we can instead of fighting or blaming each other. It starts by humanizing every person, regardless of their background. When there is a lack of respect, there can be no trust, and effective collaboration relies on trust, even amidst disagreements.We have seen the consequences of losing respect for our governments, manifested in violent attacks on parliaments and even the U.S. Capitol in 2021. So, how do we begin to repair this? We start by dropping our biases, stereotypes, and preconceptions, and by seeking to understand others' interests, which is key to mutual gain negotiations. We must talk to each other rather than at each other. Listening is a powerful tool, and treating every personal interaction with respect, empathy, kindness, and compassion is essential. By starting with ourselves and becoming better, more engaged community members, we can improve our lives and the lives of those around us.Participating in democracy means getting politically involved, running for office, being part of an interest group advocating for a cause and working with your representatives. There are many ways you can help ensure that government is truly for the people, by the people, our people.\n\nIt appears to me that all the liberal mailbag writers are going to continue their vile letters about Trump and the Republican Party up until November 5. I don't think they are going to change anyone's mind on who to vote for. Biden has created such a mess of his domestic and international politics that our country is going to have a hard time recovering from. The biggest issue is his open border policy and that alone will cost him the election.\n\nFormer President Trump has repeatedly declared that he has an undisclosed plan to end the Russia-Ukraine War in \"24 hours.\" With the deaths, devastation, and billions of dollars being expended on the conflict, it would seem incumbent upon him, as a public service, to reveal his plan so that, if it is viable, it can be implemented to resolve that matter in a day.One would think that Republicans in Congress, reluctant to expend funds to help Ukraine as well as MAGA adherents and America Firsters who do not support the aid would urge the ex-president to disclose his plan to suit their desires.The last presidential candidate to foist a secret plan like this was another master of mendacity: Richard Nixon. In 1968, he promoted his \"I've got a secret\" concerning the War in Vietnam. After he was elected, the secret was out: there was no plan and the war grinded on for another seven years at the expense of countless lives and funds.Those who would fall for the former president's secret plan ought to recall that old saying: Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\"It would be a shame if this scam works again.\n\nIt's time for our nation to have a real discussion of the value of birthright citizenship.The idea that foreigners coming into the United States are guaranteed the right to have birthright citizenship granted to their children born here is an old-fashioned idea. The rest of the world has either restrictive birthright or completely refuses to recognize birthright citizenship in their country.One might ask why is this a problem? The answer is it leads to dual citizenship which is conferred on their newborn children. This is not a natural extension of any nation's goals is to have dual citizenship of two nations.We should not have folks with dual interests within the U.S. using their birthright in the U.S. to have the ability to push their parents' homeland interests and values on us. We should be a melting pot that can be achieved through restrictive birthright.An example would be when a person born here and lives here from foreign parents matures, at 18 years of age, that person would be able to choose to become a U.S. citizen. Or the simplest way is for the parents to become citizens of the U.S. and give up their homeland citizenship and then have their children.We should not have two classes of citizenship in the U.S. One for those born here by U.S. parents and another birthright class that enjoys the benefits of the U.S. citizenship and a citizenship in another country.\n\nDoes Israel have a right to exist as a safe haven for Jews or should they go back to \"where they came from\" and deal with the massive spike in antisemitism? Are Jews safe outside of Israel? If not, then we agree that Jews need a safe place to live. Or do you think Jews don't have a right to exist? If so, own it. Say it loud and clear and stop hiding behind anti Zionism.If you have hostages locked up in your home, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get. If you are aware of hostages being held in your neighborhood and you say nothing, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.If you invaded a country, killed innocent people, raped women, and abducted others, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.If you fire on soldiers as they extract innocent hostages, whether you're wearing a uniform or civilian clothing, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.If you hide weapons in your children's rooms or allow terror tunnels to be dug in your vicinity and you say/do nothing, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.If you voted for a terrorist organization to govern you, and I don't care what excuses you have, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.If you have any info on the whereabouts of innocent hostages and you don't disclose that info, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.And finally, if you openly stand with a terrorist organization and against those who try to eliminate the terrorists, you're not an innocent civilian, you're a terrorist who deserves what you get.",

        "title": "Pabloite NPA backs pro-war New Popular Front in French snap elections",
        "body": "facebook icon\n\nBy joining the New Popular Front formed by Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon's France Unbowed party and the big-business Socialist Party (PS) after President Emmanuel Macron's calling of snap elections for July 7, the New Anti-capitalist Party (NPA) has again exposed itself as a tool of imperialism. It is pushing the workers behind the political trap set by M\u00e9lenchon and former PS President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who aim to intensify war with Russia abroad and class war at home.\n\nThe NPA justifies its support this for alliance, arguing it will build left unity against the danger of the neo-fascist National Rally (RN) coming to power. The RN now has growing support in the ruling class, particularly in the faction of the The Republicans (LR) party around Eric Ciotti that calls for alliances with the RN. The NPA states:\n\n\"At this time, as the RN and its allies are in a position to take power, the Popular Front is giving hope for the social and political left, against neo-liberal reforms, for the antiracist, ecological, feminist, LGBTI struggles and for all movements for the equality of rights. ...\n\n\"The victory against the far right and Macron is only possible on condition of a large mobilization of the population, notably in workplaces, popular neighborhoods and youth. The trade union movement, the environmental struggles, the feminist movement, the movement of solidarity with Palestine, the decolonial and antiracist struggles, must profoundly nourish the program of the Popular Front. They must constitute its living force.\"\n\nBut the New Popular Front is not a great hope for the left. By supporting it, the NPA is joining in the right-wing restucturing of the ruling establishment that Macron aims to carry out via the snap elections. Macron called his snap elections for July 7, shortly after British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called snap elections for July 4, to prepare the ruling establishment for a massive escalation of the war against Russia and of the class war at home.\n\nThe newly-elected British and French governments will send officials to the July 9 NATO summit in Washington that is preparing to send troops to Ukraine for war with Russia -- a policy that Macron has repeatedly advocated. NATO's war calendar is in fact dictating the election calendar in France and Britain, as well as the NPA's political maneuvers.\n\nThe NPA's claim that the New Popular Front is nourished by anti-colonial struggles is a political lie. It is an alliance with forces like Hollande, an undisguised enemy of the working class who brutally repressed social protests at home while waging neocolonial wars from Syria to Mali. The New Popular Front's program calls to build up the French military police and intelligence services and to send troops to Ukraine, ostensibly as \"peacekeepers.\"\n\nThe New Popular Front is not the Popular Front of 1934-1938. The Popular Front was not, it must be said, an anti-colonial force. It was an alliance of Stalinist and social-democratic parties with the liberal bourgeois Radical party. The price of the alliance with the Radicals was not only to renounce socialist revolution, but also to acquiesce in France's rule over its then-vast colonial empire, stretching from Indochina to Syria and Algeria. The Popular Front was, nonetheless, far to the left of the New Popular Front.\n\nToday's New Popular Front, unlike its predecessor in the 1930s, does not contain any party with a mass base in the working class and does not even have the pretense of proposing major social reforms like the 8-hour day or paid vacations. It is a pro-war alliance that, if it formed a government under a Macron presidency, would slash workers' living standards to arm and prepare France for \"high-intensity warfare\" with Russia.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Trotskyist movement could enter into the mass working class base of the French social democracy to openly carry out political work opposing imperialism, colonialism and capitalism.\n\nThe NPA's decision to join the New Popular Front today testifies to its deep-rooted hostility to Trotkyism. It is joining an alliance with the PS, a big business party founded in 1971 and that since then has been one of French imperialism's main parties of rule.\n\nThe PS lead candidate in this month's European elections, Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, publicly denied the genocide in Gaza and called to arm Ukraine against Russia. Indeed, the PS is at the heart of imperialist war intrigue in Ukraine. Under Hollande, for whom Macron was economy minister, the PS worked with Washington and Berlin to topple pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich in a far right coup that triggered a conflict in Ukraine that now is rapidly escalating to nuclear war.\n\nThe NPA's emergence in an open alliance with the PS is the outcome of its support, ever since its foundation in 2009 based on an explicit rejection of Trotskyism, for the military adventures of French imperialism and NATO. It backed wars in Libya, Syria and Mali and also the 2014 putsch in Ukraine. Shortly after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war two years ago, NPA leader Olivier Besancenot went to Ukraine. On his return to France, he promoted NATO's arming of the Ukrainian regime and financial sanctions against Russia as anti-fascist resistance, declaring:\n\n\"We understand that Ukrainians are demanding weapons deliveries, especially defensive weapons that allow to have control of the skies. Those with whom we spoke over there stress that they do not plan for forces other than theirs to substitute themselves for the Ukrainian resistance. On the question of economic sanctions, we are fighting for sanctions against the oligarchs, but we are still falling far short. In Britain, in Cyprus, we are at only 1 percent of what could be done.\"\n\nThis brief for war with Russia is a pack of lies that exposes the anti-fascist pretenses of the NPA and the entire New Popular Front. The Ukrainian regime is not a democratic, anti-fascist regime but a far-right dictatorship. Its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has suspended elections and rules based on a network of intelligence agencies and far-right militias led by operatives loyal to the memory of the Ukrainian Nazi-collaborationist Stepan Bandera.\n\nAgainst the NPA's utterly fraudulent presentation of their Ukrainian war policy as a \"hope for the left,\" workers and youth can only orient themselves by turning to the history of the great struggles of the Trotskyist movement. A class gulf separates Pabloite support for NATO wars from the International Committee of the Fourth International's (ICFI) Trotskyist opposition to both NATO imperialism and the post-Soviet Russian capitalist regime.\n\nPabloism emerged in an international split with the ICFI, the defenders of the continuity of Trotskyism, in 1953. Michel Pablo and Ernest Mandel rejected the Marxist conception of the working class as an independent revolutionary force and called on the Trotskyist movement to liquidate itself into Stalinist, social-democratic or bourgeois nationalist movements. After the 1991 dissolution of the USSR by the Stalinist bureaucracy, which the Pabloites had previously promoted as revolutionary, it oriented to support for imperialist war, in line with the interests of their affluent middle class base.\n\nThe NPA's evolution since its founding in 2009 -- during which the Pabloites publicly liquidated its predecessor, the Ligue communiste r\u00e9volutionnaire -- has confirmed the assessment made by the ICFI at the time on the WSWS. In 2009, it explained:\n\nThe LCR's real target in liquidating itself is, in fact, Trotsky's political heritage: an insistence on the complete political independence of the working class, revolutionary internationalism, and an irreconcilable opposition to collaboration with the bourgeois state, the Stalinist and social-democratic bureaucracies, and all brands of bourgeois nationalism and petty-bourgeois radicalism.\n\nThe LCR's selection of anti-capitalism as its guiding ideology is, in the context of European and especially French politics, a colossal step backwards and to the right, towards the cheapest coin of the realm. Politically indistinct, it embraces all manners of social discontent, regardless of class basis or orientation. It is a term that can be embraced in large sections of the petty-bourgeoisie, both left and right -- everything from the anarchism proposed by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in the mid-19th century to the violent right-populist protests of Pierre Poujade of the mid-20th.\n\nThe escalation of NATO and Macron against Russia will provoke explosive mass opposition. After polls in February showed 68 of French people opposed Macron's call to send troops to Ukraine, a Eurasia Group poll showed 88 percent of Western Europeans oppose escalation and want a negotiated settlement of the Ukraine war. But these events are an urgent warning. A movement against war and dictatorship can only be built from below, mobilizing rank and file workers independently of labor bureaucracies tied to pseudo-left parties like the NPA.\n\nThe political basis of such a movement is a struggle for Trotskyism against Stalinism and the New Popular Front. This requires above all building the Parti de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 socialiste (PES), the French section of the ICFI, as the Trotskyist opposition to the New Popular Front and the NPA. Just as there can be no socialism without democracy, there will not be democracy without a Trotskyist struggle by workers in France and internationally for socialism.\n\nRead moreHow the French New Popular Front strengthens the far right26 June 2024NPA attacks \"leftist\" opposition to French union bureaucracy's talks with Macron2 April 2023French section of IMT backs pro-war New Popular Front in snap elections27 June 2024Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:FranceEuropeThe Politics of the Pseudo-Left",

The NPA claims this alliance is necessary to counter the rising threat of the neo-fascist National Rally (RN). However, critics argue that the New Popular Front is a pro-war coalition that supports imperialist policies, including escalating conflict with Russia and intensifying domestic class struggles. The alliance is seen as a right-wing restructuring of the ruling establishment, aligning with Macron's agenda and NATO's war plans. The NPA's support for this front is viewed as a betrayal of Trotskyist principles, aligning with big business interests and imperialist wars. The article calls for a Trotskyist opposition to this alliance, advocating for a grassroots movement against war and dictatorship.",

        "body": "Former President Donald Trump speaks to a crowd over 1,000 people at a June 28 rally in Chesapeake, Virginia. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)\n\nCHESAPEAKE -- \"We win Virginia, and the race is over,\" former president Donald Trump told a crowd of more than a thousand at Historic Greenbrier Farms in Chesapeake on Friday.\n\nHe and opponent President Joe Biden each held rallies following their debate the night before. Biden held one in Raleigh, North Carolina earlier in the day.\n\nIn a roughly hour and a half-long speech, Trump took several victory laps for not entering America into new wars and pressing Congress to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 during his first term.\n\nTrump made several factually inaccurate statements during his remarks. One example was his false claim that in 2020, protesters in Portland, Seattle and Minneapolis were \"ripping people apart and killing people\" during demonstrations that roiled the nation after a Black man, George Floyd, was killed by a white police officer.\n\nWith border security still a key issue for Trump in this election, he alleged without proof that other countries are releasing droves of people from prisons and mental institutions to come into America.\n\nBefore the former president took the stage, the gathering had a county fair vibe, but Trump-themed. Attendees milled about, perused Trump merchandise, and visited food trucks in a large field on Historic Greenbrier Farms.\n\nChesapeake resident Renee Cobb said she's not been particularly pleased by either presidential candidate and that this presidential election feels like picking between the \"lesser of two-evils.\"\n\nPolicy-wise, she gravitates Republican, so attending the rally was a way for her to hear directly from Trump more about his plans should he be elected.\n\n\"He really skirted a lot of questions that I would have been interested in,\" Cobb said of the debate the night prior.\n\nCobb described the debate as a \"s -- show\" for both candidates, though she thinks it went worse for Biden. The president, age 81, spoke in a voice that was often soft and raspy, stumbled over his words at points, and appeared to lose his train of thought a few times. A June Gallup poll found the American voters surveyed \"are nearly twice as likely to say Biden is too old to be president (67%) as say this about Trump (37%).\"\n\n\"My biggest thing from the debate last night was that the Democrats are even saying Biden isn't fit,\" Cobb said.\n\nTrump played into those impressions throughout his speech Friday, taking jabs at Biden and often calling him \"Crooked Biden\" and \"Sleepy Biden.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rich Vanderford's vote for Trump has never been in question. The North Carolina resident drove to Chesapeake on Friday to attend the Trump rally.\n\nHe said that he's been frustrated with the rising cost of living and inflation in recent years and hopes that Trump will be able to help alleviate that. He also supports Trump's plans for tighter U.S.-Mexico border security and the former president's more assertive stance when engaging with foreign governments.\n\n\"I feel like World War III is right around the corner,\" he said of international conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war and tensions between Israel and Hamas, which governs Gaza in the West Bank.\n\nTrump mentioned that he's the only \"competent\" candidate that can prevent that, saying he wants America to have defense systems similar to Israel's dome.\n\nSpeakers at the event included Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, GOP U.S. Senate nominee Hung Cao, former Republican governors Bob McDonnell and George Allen and U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, who represents the second congressional district.\n\nYoungkin, who endorsed Trump in March, said \"Joe Biden's path to retirement runs through Hampton Roads.\"\n\nKiggans' race against Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal could likely be close by November, as the Virginia Beach-anchored district often oscillates between partisan control.\n\n\"What we saw last night was elder abuse,\" Kiggans said Friday afternoon of Biden's performance in the presidential debate.\n\nSmasal's campaign is buffeted by investments from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and potential next Speaker of the House, Hakeem Jeffries, has endorsed her.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Virginia organized a nearby gathering earlier in the day that was supposed to support Smasal's campaign, but she pulled out at the last minute. The event, featuring military veterans and DPVA chair Susan Swecker, was designed to put Trump on blast for past comments referring to military members killed in action as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\"",

        "body": "Joe Biden, in this week's presidential debate with President Donald Trump, revealed himself as unfocused, uncomprehending, unable to express his thoughts, unable to track a line of argument, unable to remember facts, and unwilling to step aside.\n\nHe also did something else: Made the world a lot less safe.\n\nIt is John Daniel Davidson, who wrote at The Federalist of the new, enhanced threat.\n\nHe said while the \"chatter\" was all about what the Democrats will do for a 2024 candidate, \"now that the president has shown himself to be unfit for office,\" there's another issue.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\n\"An important point has gone largely unnoticed: America essentially has no president right now. Whomever is calling the shots in the White House, especially on foreign affairs, it isn't Biden. While it's true that much of American governance has devolved into the hands of an unelected (and unaccountable) administrative bureaucracy, when it comes to foreign policy and decisions about how to respond to crises overseas, the president still plays an important and arguably indispensable role,\" Davidson explained.\n\nHowever, he noted, \"Our current president, as the entire world now knows, cannot follow the train of his own thoughts. He seems to have only a tenuous grasp on reality. He can barely walk down a few steps. Clearly, he's not the one in charge of the White House, which means the presidency itself is remarkably weak right now. That in turn means the world is a much more dangerous place after last night, because America's adversaries know they have a narrow window to exploit the obvious weakness of our executive branch while Biden is still in office.\"\n\nThe danger, then, he explained, isn't what \"fallout\" there might be from the debate. \"It might be actual fallout.\"\n\nHe explained, \"Right now there are multiple hot conflicts around the world -- and not just low-level coups in small countries like Bolivia and Kenya. Israel is essentially at war with Iran. The Russia-Ukraine war rages on, no end in sight. And China could launch an invasion of Taiwan any day. These are dangerous times even without a dementia-addled 81-year-old in the White House. But the extent of Biden's decline has made it even more dangerous.\n\n\"To be clear, Biden has been unfit for office for years at this point. But the public spectacle of the debate gave a new urgency to a reality that our establishment media and political classes have been denying for a while now. Simply put, the debate made it undeniable that Biden is in a state of rapid decline. He can barely string a sentence together or keep track of what he's talking about. There is no way to spin it. The entire world saw the reality of our situation last night.\"\n\nIn contrast, he explained, was Trump.\n\n\"Cogent, forceful, and clear-eyed about the threats we face abroad and what he'll do about them,\" Davidson explained.\n\nIt was former deputy national security adviser for Trump K.T. McFarland who brought up the point that Iran, China and Russia, and others, \"realize they have a harrowing window of opportunity to exploit U.S. weakness.\"\n\nAlso there are key differences in the foreign policies pursued by Trump and Biden. Under Trump, Moscow didn't attack Ukraine and there was peace in the Middle East. Not so under Biden.\n\nThe differences, he said, are noted by \"our adversaries.\"\n\n\"They know it will be much harder to pursue their strategic aims during a second Trump administration for the simple reason that Trump's foreign policy is guided by nationalism in a way that Biden's is not,\" he said.\n\nAfter the debate, he warned, \"the entire world knows we don't have a competent commander in chief. We don't even have a president.\"\n\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

        "title": "Dueling Summits Show the Need to Enlist Arab Support on Ukraine",
        "body": "Key Middle East actors tend to distrust the U.S. narrative about the war and conclude they can reap better economic benefits from Russia, so Washington should do more to get them off the sidelines.\n\nTwo competing international gatherings took place this month: a Russian-hosted BRICS meeting in Nizhny Novgorod and a Ukraine peace summit in Lucerne, Switzerland. Alternative visions of the world order stood in the backdrop of these dueling events. Moscow wants to replace the U.S.-led liberal international order with a multipolar world, while the West wants to preserve the existing model. During his opening remarks in Nizhny Novgorod, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov highlighted the growing role of the BRICS alliance -- founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China and later joined by South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates -- in creating this new world order. In contrast, the Swiss summit -- organized in coordination with Kyiv but without Russia's participation -- aimed to build broader global support for Ukraine's vision of peace. Moscow dismissed the event as \"futile.\"\n\nThe meetings also represented a battle for support from \"global south\" countries in the Middle East and Africa. Many of these governments have declined to join Western efforts to isolate Russia during the Ukraine war; in fact, some have given Moscow an outlet to keep its economy afloat amid Western pressure, leaving President Vladimir Putin with little reason to change his cost-benefit calculus, halt the war, or seek a genuine peace settlement. Unfortunately, the outcome of the dueling summits suggests that most Arab partners are not contemplating any meaningful policy adjustments as the war surges on.\n\nWhat Happened at the Meetings?\n\nBRICS is a Russian creation -- Moscow spurred its initial formation in 2009 and assumed chairmanship of the organization earlier this year. The June 10-11 summit was the first gathering since BRICS expanded from five members to nine in January. The event proceedings included Lavrov's remarks decrying the West's perceived international dominance and its use of sanctions to \"influence the choice of development models.\" Afterward, twenty-two foreign ministers signed a joint statement focusing on de-dollarization, cooperation on a digital economy, and \"comprehensive reform\" of the UN General Assembly and Security Council.\n\nMeanwhile, the June 15-16 summit in Switzerland was perhaps Ukraine's most ambitious effort yet to rally global support for its vision of peace, with over 100 nations and organizations attending. Russia actively worked to undermine the event -- the Swiss government reported an increase in cyberattacks and disinformation in the run-up to the summit. In the end, eighty-three countries signed a joint communique that called for preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity as the basis for a peace settlement while touching on other issues such as nuclear safety, food security, and prisoner exchanges. President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the summit for making the \"first steps toward peace.\"\n\nStill, the majority of the communique's signatories were Western countries, which also sent higher-level representatives to the event. Several key powers from the global south attended but did not sign -- most notably India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates, all of whom have important trade relationships with Moscow. Among other factors, Russia's absence and the ongoing Gaza crisis likely convinced key Middle Eastern states to either not sign the communique or skip the summit entirely. Turkey attended and signed, but Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan noted that the summit would have been more \"result-oriented\" if Russia were present. After the communique was publicly released, Iraq, Jordan, and Rwanda reportedly withdrew their signatures. Egypt focused on the BRICS meeting instead, as did China.\n\nNo Real Saudi or Emirati Shift on Ukraine\n\nThe global role of the Gulf states -- especially leading energy producers Saudi Arabia and the UAE -- has only grown in importance since Russia invaded Ukraine. Saudi and Emirati state companies have taken advantage of the crisis by buying large amounts of Russian petroleum products at discount prices, despite U.S. objections that such purchases bolster Moscow and undermine Western sanctions. In addition, Putin traveled to both countries last December, further highlighting their willingness to court ties with the Kremlin.\n\nAccordingly, Zelensky made a special push to ensure Saudi participation in the Swiss summit. Initial reports suggested Riyadh would not send a delegation, but Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan wound up attending after Zelensky made a last-minute visit to Riyadh on June 12. While in Lucerne, Prince Faisal noted that Riyadh had leveraged its \"positive relations\" with both Ukraine and Russia.\n\nIndeed, the kingdom has sought to position itself as a mediator between Moscow and Kyiv at various times during the war, from facilitating a major prisoner exchange in September 2022 to providing over $400 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and hosting an international peace summit in August 2023. At the same time, however, the Saudis have been indirectly undermining Western sanctions by cooperating with Russia on oil issues -- not just purchasing its petroleum products as described above, but also coordinating production cuts that have kept oil prices (and, by extension, Russia's war budget) afloat. At the Swiss event, Riyadh noted that Russian participation in future summits would require a \"difficult compromise,\" implying that Ukraine would have to make greater concessions than it currently envisions.\n\nThe UAE's wartime balancing act has leaned even more toward Moscow. On one hand, Abu Dhabi announced early in the crisis that it would provide $5 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine in response to a UN appeal, and it has voted in favor of several UN resolutions regarding Russia's invasion. Most recently, it brokered an exchange of 180 prisoners of war between Ukraine and Russia. On the other hand, it has been careful not to condemn Moscow directly, and it joined the BRICS in January despite the ongoing international campaign to pressure Russia and end the war.\n\nPerhaps most important, the UAE has become Russia's largest trading partner in the Arab world. Bilateral trade was growing steadily before the war and continued that trajectory afterward, reaching $9 billion in 2022, the majority of which was Russian exports. The two countries reportedly aim to hit $10 billion by the end of 2024.\n\nWestern governments are particularly concerned about reports that some of this Emirati trade includes sanctioned dual-use items such as computer chips and electronics, which Russia could use in the war. Weeks before the Swiss summit, a U.S. delegation visited the UAE to press officials about the country's trade ties with Russia, highlighting the fact that certain companies have been evading sanctions.\n\nPolicy Implications\n\nAsking Arab partners to help isolate Russia has had little success so far. Yet Washington can still do more to show them that Moscow's vision for a new world order is a losing one, and that their fears about taking firmer action are exaggerated. One way to do so is by showing the limits of what the BRICS can accomplish, demonstrating that a transparent global trade system backed by the United States will generate more wealth for them than an oligarchic model led by Russia.\n\nAs for the Ukraine war, global south governments have been pushing their preference for a peace process in which both combatants are involved rather than a Kyiv-led process. This push seems rooted in three perceptions: that the United States has been unreliable and hypocritical in its relationships with Middle East partners, that they can derive genuine benefits from Moscow, and that Russia will remain a permanent fixture of international relations no matter how the war ends. More broadly, the global south is simply not buying the Western narrative about the war.\n\nThe Swiss summit did lay the groundwork for potential Russian participation in future peace talks. Zelensky reportedly considers Saudi Arabia as a prime candidate to host the next summit, highlighting the kingdom's importance for Ukraine. If Riyadh agrees to host, the United States would have ample opportunity to shape the next talks and engage regional countries on key concerns about Russia.\n\nAs for the terms of future talks, Russia should at minimum be expected to accept the principle of Ukrainian territorial integrity, even if only rhetorically at first. But actually reaching a successful diplomatic settlement will require changing Putin's cost-benefit calculus. If substantive talks take place before he is pushed into a losing position, he will have leverage to negotiate concessions that give Russia time and resources to rebuild its military and attack Ukraine again. Ultimately, a premature peace settlement would be of little use if it allows Russia to keep threatening Europe, global security, and the liberal world order in the long term. As this month's summits show, the fight to shift Putin's calculus is not limited to the battlefield, so Washington should marshal its diplomatic energies accordingly.\n\nAnna Borshchevskaya is a senior fellow in The Washington Institute's Diane and Guilford Glazer Foundation Program on Great Power Competition and the Middle East.",

        "summary": "The article discusses two recent international summits: a BRICS meeting in Russia and a Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland, highlighting the contrasting visions of global order they represent. The BRICS summit, chaired by Russia, emphasized a multipolar world and included discussions on de-dollarization and UN reforms. In contrast, the Swiss summit aimed to garner global support for Ukraine's peace vision, with 83 countries signing a communique supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n\nKey Middle Eastern and African countries, however, remain hesitant to fully back Western efforts to isolate Russia, often due to economic ties with Moscow. Notably, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have maintained significant trade relationships with Russia, complicating their stance on the Ukraine conflict. Despite some humanitarian gestures towards Ukraine, these Gulf states have also indirectly supported Russia by purchasing its petroleum products and coordinating oil production cuts.\n\nThe article suggests that the U.S. needs to better engage these Arab partners, demonstrating that a U.S.-backed global trade system is more beneficial than Russia's oligarchic model. It also emphasizes the importance of involving Russia in future peace talks, potentially hosted by Saudi Arabia, to ensure any settlement respects Ukraine's territorial integrity and prevents future threats from Russia.",

        "title": "Biden Debate Performance Could Embolden America's Enemies To Attack",
        "body": "Chairman Xi, President Putin, Supreme Leader Khamanei, and the North Korean dictator might conclude that a president whose faculties seem compromised represents an opportunity to weaken America.\n\nIf adversaries deem America to be as feeble as President Biden appeared during Thursday's debate, will they use one of the lamest of lame-duck periods in history to undermine the country's global leadership and attack our allies?\n\nWhether Mr. Biden remains on the ticket in November or is replaced with another Democrat, his presidential term will last until January 20. After the CNN debate, Chairman Xi, President Putin, Supreme Leader Khamanei, and the North Korean dictator might conclude that a president whose faculties seem compromised represents an opportunity to weaken America.\n\nOne argument President Trump made Thursday is that world leaders do not respect Mr. Biden's America. \"He will drive us into World War III,\" the former president said. A similar argument was made by Democrats about Mr. Trump before his 2016 victory.\n\nIn the last three-and-a-half years, though, a global coalition of dictators has tightened significantly. A powerful bloc of world leaders, whose only common goal is to diminish America's power in the world, increased its cooperation.\n\nIran and North Korea are helping arm Russia for its Ukraine war. Russia is boosting Tehran's nuclear program. Communist China is buying subsidized oil from the Islamic Republic in defiance of American sanctions. Beijing is aiding Moscow financially and diplomatically.\n\nMoscow officials insist that Mr. Putin ignored the Biden-Trump showdown. \"I don't think that you can expect the Russian president to set his alarm to watch the debate,\" the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said. \"This isn't a main event for us.\"\n\nStill, the government-controlled Russian press was gleeful. \"Biden expectedly misspoke multiple times and stammered, Democrats have already called his performance a failure,\" a top press agency, RIA, writes. In Communist China, the Beijing-monitored social media outlet Weibo was just as snarky.\n\nConspiracy theories were freely expressed regarding Mr. Biden's condition, including unsubstantiated speculation about use of performance-enhancing drugs. \"A normal person blinks every 3 seconds when he speaks,\" according to one Weibo user, who asks, \"Why does Biden take 20 seconds?\"\n\nPopular comments aside, Chinese, Russian, Arab, and Iranian observers noticed that Democrats and former supporters were shocked by Mr. Biden's performance. Leaders must have heard a groundswell of calls on the president to withdraw from the race.\n\nWhether Mr. Biden remains on the top of the ticket or is replaced by another Democrat, he will remain president for nearly seven more months unless he resigns in favor of Vice President Harris. His debate image -- one of a frail, at times incoherent, and slow-witted leader -- could change calculations in world capitals.\n\nMr. Xi is scheduled to go to Peru in the fall for an Asia-Pacific summit. The visit will follow the November 5 presidential election, and Mr. Biden is yet to confirm his attendance. During the event, the Beijing strongman will inaugurate a $3.5 billion Peruvian project, a megaport built by a Beijing-controlled firm, Cosco.\n\nThe deep-water port will tighten commercial trade between Communist China and Latin America, and seal the growing ties between Beijing and the resource-rich Western Hemisphere. It will also bring the People's Liberation Navy ever closer to America's backyard. In his own backyard, meanwhile, Mr. Xi increasingly threatens the Philippines and other neighbors.\n\nBeijing may well assess that a weakened American presidency until January is a ripe moment to fulfill Mr. Xi's declared goal of annexing the island of Taiwan. Following Mr. Biden's debate performance, he might conclude that America's reaction would not be as forceful as the White House has declared it would be.\n\nIn the last few months, similarly, the Islamic Republic has installed 1,400 new high-speed uranium enrichment centrifuges inside the underground Fordow plant, in defiance of global pressure. The International Atomic Energy Agency reports that Iran is amassing enriched uranium to 60 percent purity, which could easily be converted to weapons level.\n\nWill the aging Mr. Khamenei decide that Mr. Biden's woes are a good time to complete the transformation of the Islamic Republic into a nuclear-armed power? Will President Kim of North Korea now seize the moment to attack South Korea? How about Mr. Putin's designs on the Baltic states?\n\nIsraelis are concerned that American weaknesses could harm their ability to fend off Tehran-backed armies that aim to grind them down by a war of attrition. Will Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, the Iraqi and Syrian militias, the Houthis, and, most notably, Hezbollah now use America's months of distraction to further escalate the war on the Jewish state?\n\nFacing such perils, Mr. Biden could make a decisive military move in one or more of these arenas. If successful, it would also enhance his political fortunes at home. Yet, his performance Thursday raises questions as to whether he is capable of making such bold decisions.",

        "title": "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: How is Egypt doing after a decade of his rule?",
        "body": "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, president of Egypt since June 2014, had visions about leading his country long before the 2013 coup that brought him to power.\n\nIn one dream, recounted to a local newspaper before he became leader, Sisi said he had a conversation with the late president Anwar al-Sadat: \"I told him that I knew I would become president of the republic, and he said he knew I would become president of the republic.\"\n\nIn another, he said he was told: \"We will give you what we have not given anyone.\"\n\nAbdel Fattah Saeed Hussein Khalil el-Sisi, the sixth president of Egypt, was born in Cairo on 19 November 1954. His father was an antiques merchant and his mother a homemaker.\n\nWhen he first became president, Sisi had no detailed political platform, no political party, and only two main promises: that he would bring about economic prosperity within two years in office; and that he would obliterate terrorism.\n\nYet, 10 years into his rule, Egyptians are getting poorer and the main targets of his war on terrorism appear to be the peaceful political opposition.\n\nSisi graduated from the Egyptian Military Academy in 1977. He then served in the armed forces, first commanding a mechanised division in the infantry, then as Egypt's military attach\u00e9 in Riyadh and commander of Egypt's Northern Military Zone in Alexandria.\n\nDuring his military career, he studied at the British Command and Staff College in 1992 and the United States Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in 2006.\n\nSisi was also head of military intelligence until the 2011 revolution forced President Hosni Mubarak from power. But while he was promoted to field marshal in January 2014, just before retirement and after more than three decades of service, he never saw active combat.\n\nWith Mubarak gone, Sisi became the youngest member of the ruling interim military council, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (Scaf), which handed power to Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected president, in June 2012.\n\nTwo months later, Morsi appointed Sisi as defence minister and commander-in-chief of the army in a surprise reshuffle, forcing Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi into retirement after more than 20 years in the post.\n\nDuring this time, Sisi came to prominence as a de facto mediator between Morsi and members of the opposition in an apparent challenge to the president.\n\nA year into Morsi's rule, and following large anti-government protests against the backdrop of political and economic malaise, Sisi staged a successful coup on 3 July against the administration, detaining the president and his senior staff and declaring an interim government in which Sisi was to serve as deputy prime minister.\n\nThroughout the months following the removal of Morsi, Sisi denied any intention to run for office and insisted that his move was not a coup.\n\nSisi's supporters regarded the protests as a second revolution after the January 2011 revolution that ousted Mubarak. In contrast, Sisi's opponents called it a bloody coup against popular legitimacy and the will of Egyptians, as expressed through democracy.\n\nIn the months following the coup, Sisi oversaw what rights groups described as possible crimes against humanity, as thousands of pro-Morsi protesters were gunned down or detained in the country's worst episode of police brutality in modern history.\n\nThe crackdown culminated in what became known as the Rabaa massacre, in which more than a thousand protesters who demanded an end to the coup were killed by security forces in one day on 14 August 2013 in Cairo's Rabaa Square.\n\nIn addition to his position as deputy prime minister, Sisi also retained his position as minister of defence, and was often the public face of the new administration.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Rabaa massacre, he sought a direct \"authoritsation\" from the Egyptian people to manage what he said was terrorism. He eventually retired from his military career in March 2014 and announced that he would run as a candidate in the May 2014 presidential election.\n\nSisi ran against one opponent, Hamdeen Sabbahi, one of the left-wing politicians who supported the coup and was elected president with 97 percent of the vote. He was sworn in as president on 8 June 2014.\n\nThe election was widely considered to be a sham, as most of Sisi's possible opponents were in jail, including Morsi and supporters of his Muslim Brotherhood group, along with senior opposition leaders from other parties that rejected the coup, and secular youth leaders of the 2011 revolution.\n\nSisi was reelected four years later in 2018 and introduced constitutional amendments in 2019 that would allow him to stay in power for two further consecutive terms of six years each instead of four. Sisi is currently serving his third term after his election in December 2023 and reinstatement as president in April 2024. As things stand, he will be obliged to stand down in 2030.\n\nIn every election that followed the 2013 coup, Sisi's potential opponents have been excluded, jailed, or disqualified. This includes Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister under Mubarak and Morsi's main presidential rival, who was reportedly forced out of the 2018 race after threats from a senior intelligence officer.\n\nAnother rival, Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, was detained after calling for a boycott of the 2018 vote; a third, General Sami Anan was detained for more than a year and has been under house arrest since his announcement that he would run for presidency in 2018.\n\nThe latest challenger to Sisi, left-wing politician Ahmed Tantawy, has also been detained in the aftermath of the 2023 elections and is currently serving a one-year prison term for alleged unauthorised campaign activities.\n\nSisi did not present a detailed electoral platform at the start of his rule 10 years ago. Instead, he made broad promises to improve living standards and to protect the poorest segments of society.\n\nHe used a style of communication that played on the popular imagination and that seemed to ensure his popularity for several years, using phrases such as \"Egypt is the mother of the world\" and pledging that he would again make it world-class.\n\nSisi also lamented that previous leaders did not sufficiently care for the people and that what was needed was empathy and concern. He promised unprecedented economic prosperity within two years. When that failed to materialise by 2015, he promised that 2020 would see the culmination of significant economic development. When that failed to materialise he blamed the Covid crisis and the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nHowever economic indicators have consistently worsened under his rule. Egypt is the most populous Arab country, with an estimated 106m people. The World Bank estimated that nearly 30 percent of its population was poor in 2019, with millions more at risk of falling below the poverty line.\n\nThe Egyptian pound has dwindled by more than 600 percent since Sisi came to power in 2014 when it traded at about seven pounds to the dollar. At the time of writing it is now at around $48 to the dollar.\n\nThe cost of food staples has risen due to currency fluctuations: in June 2024, the government increased the price of subsidised bread by 300 percent, for the first time in 35 years, affecting an estimated 65m Egyptians who rely on bread as their main food staple.\n\nBut as the economy faltered, so Sisi shifted into blame mode. In January 2023, he attacked the media for negative public reaction about the food costs. \"Why do you portray Egyptians as if they are in a state of panic over food and drink? This is not appropriate,\" he said. \"I am not saying this is not true; but eating and drinking is not the end of the world.\"\n\nIn a later speech in October 2023, Sisi called his opponents \"liars, saboteurs and wicked\", as critics questioned the billions spent on infrastructure projects while many Egyptians struggled. \"Don't you Egyptians dare say you would rather eat than build and progress,\" Sisi said. \"If the price of the nation's progress and prosperity is to go hungry and thirsty, then let us not eat or drink.\n\n\"Don't undermine the cause of our nation and make us the world's laughing stock. Stand fast and transform the cruel circumstances we are going through into a gift. The harder you stand fast, the sooner it [the economic crises] will pass.\"\n\nSince Sisi took power, Egypt's debt has more than tripled to $165bn. In addition, it has paid $132bn in installments and interest on external debt over the same period, with these payments accounting for most of government expenditure. In February, foreign currency reserves stood at only $35bn.\n\nIn February, global partners including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Union, and the United Arab Emirates signed rescue deals with Egypt worth more than $57bn.\n\nA $35bn deal with the UAE in February for Cairo to build a new city on Egypt's north coast boosted government confidence enough that it floated the currency, one of the bailout conditions imposed by the IMF.\n\nThe government has also been criticised for not allocating the constitutionally mandated percentages of expected GDP to budget for education and healthcare: each sector respectively only received 1.94 percent (instead of six percent) and 1.5 percent (instead of three percent).\n\nSisi's economic vision, known as Egypt Vision 2030 (and inspired by the Saudi strategy Vision 2030) is largely based on expensive mega projects that he believes can transform the country's future\n\nThey include the digging of a 35km lane along a section of the Suez Canal, branded as a \"New Suez Canal\". The project cost $8.2bn: Sisi promised it would boost the canal's revenues and alleviate Egypt's economic woes. Yet, the canal's revenues have dropped in recent years and Egypt is now considering a further expansion of the strategic waterway.\n\nA study by the Alternative Policy Solutions think tank at the American University in Cairo published in August showed that the 2015 project has not boosted the canal's income as hoped: expenditures including wages and taxes, have increased in line with revenues, with the cost-to-income ratio a negative indicator of the profitability of the project since 2015.\n\nAnother mega project, and one of the blueprints for Sisi's rule, is the New Administrative Capital (NAC), a $58bn \"smart city\" that is intended to relieve some of the congestion in Cairo. It's where Sisi inaugurated his 2024 term, and to where he and key government ministers and agencies have relocated since April.\n\nNAC, which is publicly funded and has yet to have a name, is some 45km east of Cairo. The first of three phases was scheduled to be completed by 2020 but is unfinished due to a lack of funds. Economic experts now question its feasibility, given Egypt's ailing economy.\n\nCombating terrorism was one of Sisi's main pledges on taking power. The Egyptian military fought an Islamic State insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula for years, which initially emerged after the revolution in 2011 and became deadlier after the fall of Morsi in 2013. Sisi eventually announced the defeat of the group in 2022.\n\nHowever, the campaign has been denounced for its disproportionate impact on the civilian population. Human Rights Watch has accused the Egyptian army of possible war crimes against the tribal communities of North Sinai, including mass displacement and extrajudicial killings.\n\nThe Egyptian army has also been accused of not holding members of Islamic State accountable for alleged atrocities, and instead granting them amnesty. A senior IS leader behind a 2017 attack that killed more than 300 civilians in a Sinai mosque was released by the Sisi government in 2021 after a deal.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sisi government has accused its peaceful opposition of supporting terrorism, and labelled the Muslim Brotherhood as well as the secular 6 April group, as terrorist groups.\n\nMembers of Sisi's opposition from across the political spectrum, as well as journalists and social media influencers, have faced allegations of supporting terrorism. Rights groups, however, have dismissed these allegations as politically motivated.\n\nMost of those on the government's terror list are members or supporters of the political opposition.\n\nSince the coup, Sisi has led a ferocious crackdown on any opposition, initially targeting members and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the group from which Morsi hailed. Sisi then extended the suppression to members of the secular and left-wing opposition, along with civil society and independent media.\n\nAt the time of writing, an estimated 65,000 political prisoners detained in the aftermath of Sisi's coup are still in jail, including politicians, protesters, journalists, and civil society activists. Most are either in pre-trial detention for indefinite periods; or face charges of supporting terrorism, espionage, unlawful protests, and spreading false news, among other related charges.\n\nYet Sisi, in an interview with the American CBS's 60 Minutes TV show in 2019, denied his country holds any political prisoners.\n\nSisi's campaign against the opposition has been decried as the worst human rights crisis in the country's modern history, according to the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS). On 14 August 2013 alone, security forces killed more than 1,000 anti-Sisi protesters in what became known as the Rabaa Massacre.\n\nTorture has also become widespread under Sisi. A legal analysis by local and international rights groups has concluded that it now amounts to a crime against humanity, given how systematic and widespread it has become, involving methodical beatings, electrical shocks, sexual violence, and denial of medical care.\n\nSince his coup in 2013, Sisi has been backed by the UAE and Saudi Arabia, who supported his government politically and financially.\n\nIn one of his most controversial decisions, since he became president, Sisi in 2016 signed an order ceding the strategic Red Sea islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia, prompting widespread protests and an unsuccessful court case challenging the decision.\n\nIn contrast, Qatar initially opposed the coup and the associated crackdown on Qatari-backed Al Jazeera in Egypt, along with the suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood, the political group supported by Doha.\n\nEgypt was also among the states that severed ties with Qatar in 2017, citing its alleged support for the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran. Doha-Cairo relations later thawed in 2021 as part of a reconciliation between Gulf countries and Qatar.\n\nEgyptian-Turkish relations also became strained after the coup, due to Ankara's support for Morsi's democratically-elected government and its rejection of his deposal the coup and the bloody aftermath.\n\nBut relations subsequently improved, with the restoration of diplomatic ties, and Turkish President Recep Tayyib Erdogan visiting Cairo to meet with Sisi in February 2024, despite regarding his Egyptian counterpart as a coup leader for most of the past decade.\n\nDespite initial criticism of the coup and the Rabaa massacre, Cairo has maintained close ties with successive US administrations. Former US President Donald Trump called Sisi \"my favourite dictator\", and Washington has continued to provide Egypt with military aid despite human rights concerns.\n\nThe EU has also continued to support Sisi, despite criticism of his human rights record by member states.\n\nThe Sisi government remains an Israel ally despite the latter's devastating war on neighbouring Gaza and Israel's takeover of the strategic Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt.\n\nEgypt continues to act as a mediator between Israel and Palestinian groups, but that role has declined in recent years and Doha has played a more prominent role in mediation.\n\nIsrael's control of the Rafah crossing has also dealt a blow to Egypt's leverage in Gaza and its ability to influence the conflict.",

        "summary": "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has been Egypt's president since June 2014, following a 2013 coup that ousted the country's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi. Sisi, who had no detailed political platform or party, promised economic prosperity and the eradication of terrorism. However, ten years into his rule, Egypt's economy has worsened, with rising poverty and a significant devaluation of the Egyptian pound. Sisi's tenure has been marked by severe crackdowns on political opposition, with thousands of political prisoners and allegations of human rights abuses, including the Rabaa massacre where over a thousand protesters were killed. Despite these issues, Sisi has maintained support from international allies like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and the US. His economic policies, including mega projects like the New Administrative Capital, have faced criticism for their feasibility amid Egypt's economic struggles. Sisi's government has also been accused of mismanaging funds for education and healthcare. While he claims to have defeated terrorism, his methods have been criticized for their impact on civilians. Sisi's rule has seen strained but improving relations with countries like Turkey and Qatar, and continued cooperation with Israel.",

        "title": "Who is Nigel Farage? The divisive figure whose party is stealing votes from the Tories",
        "body": "Nigel Farage has been a fixture of British politics for almost three decades, despite never being elected to Parliament. Here's everything you need to know about the man who says he wants to take over the Tories.\n\nNigel Farage has been a fixture of British politics for almost three decades, agitating over Europe and causing dissent within the Conservative Party. He played a significant role in Britain leaving the EU - something will continue to have major ramifications for years to come - yet he's only ever sat as an MP in the European Parliament.\n\nHe led the UK Independence Party (Ukip) for two decades until 2016, before forming the Brexit Party and later Reform UK.\n\nNow he's leading the party and standing for election in the right-leaning seat of Clacton. Is he starting a revolution, as he claims? Here's all you need to know about the most influential man who has never yet been elected to Westminster.\n\nFarage was born in Farnborough, Kent, in 1964 and grew up alongside his younger brother Andrew in a wealthy family.\n\nAccording to a BBC documentary his father, an alcoholic who lost his role in the City as a stockbroker, left the family home when he was five years old.\n\nTwo years later he got sober and found employment in the antiques trade. As a young boy, Farage was educated at the independent Greenhayes School for Boys in West Wickham.\n\nFarage is currently in a relationship with Laur\u00e9 Ferrari, the hard-right French politician who is more than 15 years his junior, though he has been married twice before.\n\nHis first marriage to Grainne Hayes, a lecturer in exercise physiology, lasted from 1988 to 1997 with the couple having two sons, Thomas and Samuel. He then married German-born Kirsten Mehr, his former secretary, in 1999. The pair had two daughters, Victoria and Isabelle, but Farage faced accusations of infidelity and by 2017 the couple were understood to be living separate lives.\n\nAll four of his children are known to be very private. Isabelle, who is just 19 years old and on a gap year, flew out to Australia to meet him when he left the bush camp for the reality TV show 'I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here' last year.\n\nFarage is the son of Barbara and Guy Justus Oscar Farage. After his father gave up alcohol he was able to return to his career in the City, trading on the Stock Exchange floor from the mid-1970s.\n\nHis grandfather, Harry Farage, was a private who was wounded in action during the First World War. He is descended from German immigrants who arrived in London from Frankfurt in the 1860s.\n\nAs a teenager, Farage attended the elite south London independent school for boys, Dulwich College. He joined the Conservative Party while still at school after being inspired by a visit from former Tory minister Keith Joseph.\n\nBut his early engagement in right-wing politics also courted controversy. In Michael Crick's biography of Farage, One Party After Another, former student David Edmonds, his classmate when he was 15, described him as a \"deeply unembarrassed racist\".\n\nIn 1981, Chloe Deakin, an English teacher at the school, wrote to the headmaster of Dulwich College, David Emms, to urge him not to make Farage a prefect, fearing he held \"fascist\" views - a claim that Farage later rejected.\n\nAccording to Crick, the letter describes a colleague talking about Farage's \"publicly professed racist and neo-fascist views\". The letter goes on to claim that, at a Combined Cadet Force (CCF) camp organised by the college, Farage and others \"marched through a quiet Sussex village very late at night shouting Hitler-youth songs.\"\n\nConfronted by these claims in 2013, Farage said: \"Of course I said some ridiculous things\" but insisted they were \"not necessarily racist\" adding it \"depends how you define it\". He denied even knowing the words to Hitler youth songs, describing the claim as \"complete baloney\".\n\nOthers spoken to by Crick said Farage would have been joking and being deliberately provocative. Farage's own memoir, Fighting Bull, claims teachers were hostile to him because he was an admirer of Enoch Powell, the controversial anti-immigration Conservative politician. Nevertheless, he was appointed prefect by the head.\n\nAt 18, Farage shunned a university education in favour of entering the City as a commodities trader.\n\nIn announcing his candidacy in this election and taking over leadership of his Reform party from former incumbent Richard Tice, Farage said that this general election should be \"the immigration election\".\n\nIn a social media post aimed at attacking the Conservative record on immigration, he claimed that the 50,000th migrant had crossed the English Channel in a small boat under Rishi Sunak's leadership. He has previously stated that the arrival of migrants from France on small boats \"should be declared a national emergency\".\n\nReform wants to achieve \"net zero\" immigration, and Farage has blamed immigration for rising rents, heavy traffic, the strain on social housing and long hospital waiting lists.\n\nHis manifesto states that Reform would freeze all non-essential migration, allowing entry only to those who have \"essential skills, mainly around healthcare\". However, his comments have caused anger after he claimed there were streets in the city of Oldham where nobody speaks English.\n\nUnique among the party leaders, Farage does not support a National Health Service funded solely through taxation. He has said the \"model through which we fund health is wrong\" and has called for a social health insurance scheme similar to that already used in France.\n\nHe said: \"It's been very, very difficult to have any conversation about the NHS over the course of the 25 years that I've been in politics without someone pointing and screaming 'you want to privatise it. All we want is an NHS that is free at the point of the delivery that actually works. And how we get there, frankly, I don't think most people could give a damn about.\"\n\nThe party's manifesto promises to give patients a voucher to see a private GP if they're left waiting more than three days to see their family doctor on the NHS.\n\nDespite being Brexit's primary agitator for more than two decades and pushing former Conservative leader David Cameron to call the Brexit referendum in 2016, Farage has since declared \"Brexit has failed\".\n\n\"We've not delivered on Brexit and the Tories have let us down very, very badly,\" he said.\n\nFarage has attacked the government for failing to bring any economic benefits to the country by departing the European Union. Rather than admitting Brexit might have been a mistake, he said \"useless\" Tory politicians were responsible for \"mismanaging\" the process of leaving the EU.\n\nArguing with Remain voters while appearing on TV show 'I'm a Celebrity...', Farage said Brexit had given the UK the freedom to \"make a mess of it ourselves\".\n\nHis attacks on the Conservative Party have even extended to his claim that he wants to take over the party after the election.\n\nDespite achieving rapid success in the polls since announcing his return to UK politics, Farage hit a pothole in the road after he claimed that Western nations and Nato were responsible for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"We provoked this war ... he's used what we've done as an excuse,\" he wrote in a newspaper article. \"Don't blame me for telling the truth.\"\n\nHe added: \"It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union was giving this man [Vladimir Putin] a reason to go to his Russian people to say, 'They're coming for us again' and to go to war.... I saw it coming a decade ago, warned that it was coming and am one of the few political figures who has been consistently right and honest about Russia's Ukraine war.\"\n\nHis comments were met with outrage from voters and other parties. Rishi Sunak accused him of \"appeasement\" of Putin and described him as \"dangerous for Britain's security\".\n\nFarage has long questioned the basis of climate science and argues that the push for net zero by 2050 is bad for the Britain economy. In an interview with the magazine Spiked, he said that the growth of wind energy as a clean source of power was the \"biggest collective economic insanity I've seen in my entire life\".\n\nHe has argued that the case that fossil fuels are a diminishing resource is \"based on a fallacy\" and that there is no need to change the way we live to become more ecologically sustainable.\n\n\"We are a nation that produces 1.8 per cent of global carbon dioxide, so I do not get closing down our aluminium smelters, most of our steel production, and now our refining industry, and all that production being moved to India, and therefore the steel-based products made in India then having to be shipped back to Britain! This to me makes no sense at all,\" Farage said.",

        "summary": "Nigel Farage, a prominent figure in British politics for nearly three decades, has never been elected to Parliament but has significantly influenced the UK's political landscape, particularly through his role in Brexit. Farage led the UK Independence Party (UKIP) for 20 years, then founded the Brexit Party, now known as Reform UK, which he currently leads. He is running for election in Clacton, a right-leaning constituency.\n\nBorn in 1964 in Farnborough, Kent, Farage's early life was marked by his father's alcoholism and subsequent recovery. He attended Dulwich College, where he was involved in right-wing politics and faced accusations of racism and fascism, which he has denied.\n\nFarage has been married twice and has four children. His political career began in the City as a commodities trader before he moved into politics, where he has been a vocal critic of immigration and the Conservative Party's handling of Brexit. He advocates for \"net zero\" immigration and has controversial views on the NHS and climate change.\n\nFarage's recent comments blaming NATO and Western nations for provoking Russia's invasion of Ukraine have sparked outrage and accusations of appeasement. Despite his divisive views, Farage remains a significant and influential figure in British politics.",

        "body": "OPINION - The Cipher Brief tapped expert Dave Pitts for his reaction to Thursday night's debate from a national security perspective.\n\n\"To the original national security questions, the debate was light on real foreign policy and national security issues and discussions. But to the one national security issue that was discussed, there was nothing really new on the question of continued support to Ukraine, although the debate highlighted stark differences in approach to foreign policy.\n\nBoth candidates stated that Putin's terms for ending the war were unacceptable, but the agreements stopped there.\n\nPresident Biden upheld his position of strong, continued support to Ukraine, intent for a strong NATO, and his commitment that Putin could not be allowed to continue his aggression.\n\nIt's not just for the President anymore. Cipher Brief Subscriber+Members have access to their own Open Source Daily Brief, keeping you up to date on global events impacting national security. It pays to be a Subscriber+Member.\n\nFormer President Trump also upheld his previously stated position that the Russian invasion would not have happened under his Presidency, that NATO was not doing enough, that the U.S was spending too much money in Ukraine, and that he would end the Russia-Ukraine War before he took office, if elected.\n\nAlthough other Republican leaders have expressed strong support for Ukraine, this potential conflict within the Republican Party on how to approach the Russia-Ukraine War, if there is a change in Administration, could embolden Putin, confuse our allies, and weaken Ukraine in the process.\n\nBased on this debate, certainly Ukraine, NATO, Russia, China, and other countries will anticipate a change in the U.S position on Ukraine and on other foreign policy issues if there is a new administration. Of course, there is a lot to time before the election and things can change, so stay tuned.\"\n\nThe Cipher Brief is committed to publishing a range of perspectives on national security issues submitted by deeply experienced national security professionals.\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author and do not represent the views or opinions of The Cipher Brief.\n\nHave a perspective to share based on your experience in the national security field?

        "summary": "The recent Presidential Debate inadequately addressed U.S. national security issues, focusing minimally on foreign policy. The main topic discussed was support for Ukraine, revealing significant differences between the candidates. President Biden emphasized strong, continued support for Ukraine and NATO, opposing Putin's aggression. Former President Trump criticized NATO's efforts, claimed the invasion wouldn't have occurred under his leadership, and promised to end the war if elected. This divergence within the Republican Party could potentially embolden Putin and confuse U.S. allies. The debate suggests possible shifts in U.S. foreign policy depending on the election outcome.",

        "summary": "The Modi government is concerned about Indians trapped in the Ukraine-Russia war. Dozens of Indians are believed to be stranded at the Ukraine-Russia border, with families of about two dozen contacting the Ministry of External Affairs. The government has successfully repatriated ten Indians, though two have reportedly died in the conflict.\n\nExternal Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Astana, discussing bilateral relations and global issues, with a strong emphasis on the safety and repatriation of Indians caught in the war.\n\nThis meeting is significant ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's planned visit to Moscow next week, although no official announcement has been made. The visit is expected to take place on July 8-9, marking a resumption of the annual India-Russia summit, which did not occur in 2022 and 2023.",

This will be their second face-to-face meeting since the Russia-Ukraine war began, although they have maintained regular contact via phone and video conferencing. Prior to this, Modi met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the G-7 summit in Italy, advising dialogue for conflict resolution.\n\nTV9 correspondent Manish Jha reported from the frontline in Kharkiv, where he observed Russian soldiers watching Hindi films and expressing a fondness for India, Bollywood, and Indian cuisine. This sentiment was echoed in other conflict zones like Avdiivka, Bakhmut, and Mariupol, where soldiers from both sides showed enthusiasm for India and shared their experiences and aspirations to visit the country.\n\nJha noted that his identity as an Indian journalist often ensured his safety, as both Russian and Ukrainian forces respected India's neutral stance and trusted Indian journalists to remain impartial and not disclose sensitive information. This respect was highlighted by a Russian officer's belief that Hindu deities would protect both their soldiers and Jha.",

        "summary": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's political future appears uncertain as his Liberal Party loses voter confidence, according to a recent survey. The New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Khalistan supporter Jagmeet Singh, is also seeing a decline in support. Key issues include dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, housing crisis, and lack of strong stances on international conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nA L\u00e9ger poll for the National Post indicates that if elections were held today, the NDP's support would drop from 18% to 17%, and Trudeau's Liberals would face significant losses, securing only 67 seats compared to the Conservative Party's 218 seats. The Liberals recently lost a long-held seat in a Toronto by-election, signaling deeper troubles. Jagmeet Singh has expressed public disappointment with Trudeau but remains non-committal about withdrawing support. The Conservatives currently lead with 41% support, far ahead of the Liberals' 27%.",

        "summary": "Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar raised the issue of the safety of Indian citizens fighting in the Russian army during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the SCO Summit. Jaishankar requested their safe return and expressed serious concern over their situation. This meeting precedes a proposed visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Moscow, although it has not been officially announced yet.\n\nJaishankar highlighted the progress in various areas since their last meeting in December 2023 and emphasized the urgency of ensuring the safe return of Indian citizens from the conflict zone. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs has been actively addressing the safety and repatriation of approximately 200 Indian citizens recruited by the Russian army, with reports confirming the deaths of four Indians in the war zone. India has demanded a halt to further recruitment of Indian citizens by the Russian army and has successfully repatriated ten Indians so far.\n\nAdditionally, Jaishankar discussed the global strategic landscape with Lavrov and paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi's statue in Kazakhstan's capital. He also met with Kazakhstan's Deputy Prime Minister Murat Nurtleu to discuss expanding strategic partnerships and India's growing engagement with Central Asia.",

        "summary": "Ukraine has launched a drone attack on Russia's largest Black Sea port, Novorossiysk, which is a significant oil export hub. This attack is part of Ukraine's strategy to weaken Russia economically, similar to Russia's earlier efforts to disrupt Ukraine's gas supply chain. Following the attack, the port's operations were temporarily halted, but later resumed without restrictions. The attack caused minor damage to two commercial properties and a residential apartment, with no reported injuries. Russia's defense ministry claimed to have destroyed two Ukrainian marine drones heading towards the port. This incident follows a similar drone attack on the port in May. Additionally, Russia reported destroying ten aerial drones launched by Ukraine, including one in the Moscow region. Ukraine has not commented on the attack.",

        "summary": "A demand has been raised by the Hindu community in Russia for the establishment of a Hindu temple in the country. This request was made by Sammy Kotwani, the president of the Indian National Cultural Center 'SITA'. The demand comes ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia on July 8, where he will meet President Vladimir Putin. This will be Modi's first visit to Russia since the Russia-Ukraine war began.\n\nKotwani believes that a temple would provide a place for the growing Hindu community in Russia to engage in religious and spiritual activities. He noted that many Indians, including students and professionals, have settled in Russia in recent years, and a temple would meet their religious and cultural needs.\n\nDespite Russia being a predominantly Orthodox Christian country, Kotwani does not expect the demand for a Hindu temple to negatively impact India-Russia relations. He emphasized that Russia has been generally tolerant of various religions and cultures, and the request aligns with the strong bilateral relationship between the two nations. Kotwani hopes that the temple will attract not only Hindus but also people of other faiths.\n\nThe Hindu population in Russia is estimated to be around 30,000, primarily consisting of Indian expatriates. The establishment of a temple is seen as essential to cater to their religious and spiritual needs. Historically, Hinduism began to appear in Russia in the late 19th century, and Indian cultural elements like books, yoga, and spirituality gained attention during the Soviet era.\n\nEarlier this year, Prime Minister Modi inaugurated the first Hindu temple in the Muslim-majority United Arab Emirates, highlighting the significance of such cultural centers for the Hindu community abroad.",

        "summary": "During a debate, U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump reiterated his claim that he could end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day if elected. In response, Russian UN representative Vasily Nebenzya dismissed this notion, stating that the Ukraine crisis cannot be resolved in a single day. Nebenzya mentioned that a peace agreement was close in Istanbul in 2022, but Western countries prevented it, encouraging Ukraine to continue fighting. He criticized peace summits as ineffective, noting that key countries do not participate.\n\nRecently, a Ukraine Peace Summit was held in Switzerland with around 90 countries, including India, which did not endorse any proposals. Russia and China did not attend. Nebenzya highlighted that Putin's ceasefire proposal from June 14 remains open, requiring Ukraine to withdraw troops from areas occupied by Russia in 2022 and abandon its NATO ambitions. Ukrainian President Zelensky has rejected this proposal, refusing to cede any territory.\n\nTrump has consistently claimed he could stop the war quickly if elected, blaming Biden for the conflict. The Russia-Ukraine war has been ongoing for over two years, with significant casualties and millions of Ukrainians displaced.",

        "summary": "In a recent U.S. presidential debate, Donald Trump claimed he could end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours if elected president. In response, Russia's ambassador to the UN dismissed Trump's claim as false, stating that the war could have ended in April 2022, but Western countries, including the U.S., prevented it. The Russian ambassador, Nebenzia, accused Western nations of wanting the conflict to continue and criticized Ukrainian President Zelensky's participation in peace conferences as a joke. Trump has repeatedly made this claim since May 2023, asserting he would meet with both Zelensky and Russian President Putin to stop the war. He also blamed President Biden for escalating the conflict. The war, ongoing for over two years, has resulted in thousands of deaths and displacements.",

This scheme, announced by Finance Minister Ajit Pawar in the June 28 budget, aims to benefit women and is set to start in July using existing BPL cardholder data. Shinde emphasized the government's commitment to women's and youth's welfare, criticizing opposition parties for their objections to the scheme. Additionally, Shinde's claim that Prime Minister Modi halted the Russia-Ukraine war to evacuate Indian students sparked controversy, with opposition leader Vijay Wadettiwar questioning the truth of the statement and criticizing the state's economic performance.",

        "summary": "Two Kashmiri youths are stranded in Russia due to job scams, and their families are urging the Indian government for their swift return. The families have reached out to opposition leader Rahul Gandhi to raise the issue in Parliament. One of the youths, Azad Yusuf Kumar from Pulwama, was deceived by a Dubai-based consultant and ended up in Russia, where he was forced to sign documents in Russian and subsequently handed over to the Russian military. Azad was injured in February and is currently in a dangerous situation. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is pressuring Russia for the release of Indians trapped in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and has demanded a halt to the recruitment of Indian citizens by the Russian military. The families of the stranded individuals have protested in New Delhi, and diplomatic efforts are ongoing to bring them back. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also expected to visit Russia soon, which may influence the situation.",

        "summary": "The Indian government has decided to increase the Windfall Tax on crude petroleum from \u20b93,250 to \u20b96,000 per ton, effective from July 2, 2024. This decision was announced on Monday evening. However, the Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED) on the export of diesel, petrol, and Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) will remain at zero, continuing the current exemption for these exports.\n\nPreviously, on June 15, the government had reduced the Windfall Tax on domestically produced crude oil from \u20b95,200 to \u20b93,250 per ton. The Windfall Tax, introduced on July 1, 2022, is revised every two weeks and is imposed on companies that gain significant profits due to specific circumstances, such as the surge in international crude oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This tax aims to capture the extraordinary profits made by oil companies during such periods.",

        "summary": "The Indian government has decided to increase the windfall tax on crude petroleum from \u20b93,250 per ton to \u20b96,000 per ton, effective from July 2, 2024. The announcement was made on Monday evening through an official notification. Windfall tax is imposed on companies or industries that gain sudden and significant profits due to specific circumstances. In this case, Indian oil companies benefited from the surge in international crude oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Similar taxes have also been implemented by countries like Italy and the UK on their energy companies.",

        "summary": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has announced the formation of a new far-right political alliance named \"Patriots of Europe.\" This coalition aims to become the largest right-wing group in EU politics. It includes Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz party, Austria's Freedom Party (FP\u00d6), and the Czech Republic's Action of Dissatisfied Citizens (ANO) movement. The announcement was made during a press conference in Vienna, where Orb\u00e1n was joined by FP\u00d6 leader Herbert Kickl and former Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161.\n\nThe alliance seeks to reshape European politics by prioritizing national sovereignty over federalism, freedom over orders, and peace over war. The coalition performed well in recent European Parliament elections, with Fidesz winning 11 seats in Hungary, ANO securing 7 seats in the Czech Republic, and FP\u00d6 obtaining 6 seats in Austria.\n\nTo form a new political group in the European Parliament, the alliance needs representatives from at least seven EU member states. Potential additions include Poland's Law and Justice Party (PiS) and Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD).\n\nHungary, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, aims to \"make Europe great again\" and focus on issues like illegal migration, security, and economic competitiveness. There are concerns that Hungary might obstruct Ukraine and Moldova's EU membership, given Orb\u00e1n's close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

His primary focus will be on modernizing the Indian Army under the \"Atmanirbhar Bharat\" (self-reliant India) initiative, enhancing synergy among the three armed forces, and addressing challenges posed by neighboring countries, China and Pakistan. Dwivedi emphasized the need for advanced weaponry and self-reliance in defense systems, drawing lessons from global conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war. He also faces the task of managing the Agnipath scheme, which involves recruiting soldiers on a short-term basis, and integrating new technologies to strengthen the army's capabilities.",

        "summary": "The Russia-Ukraine war, ongoing for over two and a half years, has taken a new turn with Russia deploying motorcycles and buggies in combat. Ukrainian forces, particularly in eastern Ukraine, had been targeting Russian soldiers and armored vehicles with drones and rockets, causing significant losses for Russia. In response, Russia has adopted a new tactic involving fast-moving motorcycles and buggies to attack Ukrainian positions. Ukrainian Lieutenant Mykhailo Hobitsky described a recent attack where Russian soldiers on motorcycles surrounded and fired upon Ukrainian forces, making the conflict more dangerous and intense.\n\nAccording to a New York Times report, Ukrainian officials noted that these motorcycle and buggy attacks have been the most lethal in recent months. The vehicles' speed and zigzag movement make them difficult targets for drones and other attacks, unlike slower, more predictable armored vehicles. Ukrainian artillery commander Captain Yaroslav mentioned that the battle is fierce, with every meter being contested. Russia's strategic advantage lies in its proximity to supply lines in the Donbas region, allowing continuous resupply.\n\nA Ukrainian official explained that Russian forces use heavy bombardment to force Ukrainian soldiers into their trenches, followed by rapid attacks from soldiers on motorcycles and buggies, leading to close-quarters combat. This new Russian strategy has resulted in significant Ukrainian casualties and preserved many Russian armored vehicles. The use of motorcycles and buggies has allowed Russia to inflict considerable damage on Ukrainian forces, countering Ukraine's initial success in targeting larger Russian vehicles with drones.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nIn a thrilling T20 World Cup final, India emerged victorious against South Africa, evoking memories of the iconic film \"Lagaan.\" The match was a nail-biter, with India needing 30 runs off 30 balls and having less than a 4% chance of winning according to win predictors. However, the Indian team showcased resilience and determination, reminiscent of their past comebacks against Pakistan and in other crucial matches. Key moments included a spectacular fielding effort by Suryakumar Yadav, which was compared to historic cricket moments like Kapil Dev's 1983 catch and MS Dhoni's 2011 winning shot.\n\nThe victory highlighted India's character and confidence, reflecting the nation's broader economic and global leadership strides. The Indian cricket team's success is seen as parallel to India's rapid economic growth and increasing influence on the global stage. The clarity and trust within the team, along with a well-defined process by the BCCI and team management, were crucial to their success.\n\nThe match drew attention from global tech leaders like Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who emphasized the potential for cricket's growth in the USA. Nadella, who has invested in the Major Cricket League (MCL), sees the sport's expansion in America as beneficial for business, aligning with the International Cricket Council's (ICC) goals. However, the growth of cricket in the USA will likely require India's support.",

        "summary": "In the recent U.S. presidential race, there have been calls for President Joe Biden to withdraw following a poor performance in the first live debate against Donald Trump. The debate, held on November 5, saw Biden struggling, with moments of hesitation and difficulty countering Trump's accusations. This led to speculation in political circles and media that Biden might not be able to defeat Trump.\n\nThe New York Times editorial suggested Biden should step down for the country's sake, sparking further demands for his withdrawal. However, Biden and his campaign team have firmly stated that he will not back down. Top Democratic leaders, including Senator Raphael Warnock and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, have dismissed the idea of Biden withdrawing, emphasizing their support and focusing on preparing for the next debate in September.\n\nThe debate covered various critical issues such as the Israel-Hamas conflict, Russia-Ukraine war, U.S.-China relations, abortion, gun violence, taxes, inflation, unemployment, climate change, and illegal immigration. Biden criticized Trump for leaving behind a struggling economy, while Trump accused Biden's administration of allowing a surge in illegal immigration. Despite the debate's outcome, Democratic leaders believe Biden is still the best candidate to defeat Trump.",

        "summary": "The JF-17 Thunder, a fighter jet jointly developed by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and China's Chengdu Aircraft Industry Corporation, has faced significant issues despite being praised by China and Pakistan. On June 5, 2024, a JF-17 Block 2 crashed in Punjab, Pakistan, marking the fifth crash in 13 years. The incident was confirmed by Martin-Baker, the ejection seat manufacturer, on June 11.\n\nThe JF-17, intended to replace older aircraft in the Pakistani Air Force, has about 150 units in service, though many are grounded due to maintenance issues, particularly with the Chinese-supplied RD-93 engines. These engines have shown significant operational problems, including cracks in critical components. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has further complicated maintenance due to sanctions on Russian military exports.\n\nThe aircraft also suffers from technical deficiencies, such as inadequate data transfer rates and poor radar performance, limiting its effectiveness in air defense missions. Despite these issues, Pakistan has exported the JF-17 to countries like Nigeria and Myanmar, though both have faced significant problems with the aircraft. Myanmar grounded its fleet due to structural and technical issues, while Nigeria opted for Italian M-346FA aircraft over additional JF-17s.",

        "summary": "A dramatic video has emerged from the Russia-Ukraine war, showing a Ukrainian drone destroying a Russian BM-21 Grad rocket launcher system. The attack, carried out by an FPV drone, took place in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast region of southeastern Ukraine. The video, posted by user @Osinttechnical on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), captures the moment of the explosion and the subsequent smoke cloud. The BM-21 Grad is a multi-rocket launcher system considered one of Russia's lethal weapons. The explosion was so intense due to the detonation of the rockets within the launcher, resulting in the destruction of the vehicle and the death of the Russian soldiers on board.",

        "summary": "A Russian attack on Ukraine resulted in the deaths of at least 12 people, with ongoing rescue operations in a collapsed apartment building in Dnipro. The attacks occurred as Russia intensified its efforts to push back Ukrainian forces along a 1,000-kilometer front. Russian airstrikes have targeted energy facilities and critical infrastructure, aiming to deplete Ukraine's resources. Governor Vadim Filaskin reported injuries and multiple shelling incidents in Donetsk, while Governor Alexei Smirnov mentioned child casualties in Gorodishche. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky highlighted significant losses in the country's thermal and hydroelectric energy capacities and called for more air defense systems from allies. The Ukrainian Air Force claimed to have downed 10 Russian drones overnight.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the application of historical geopolitical concepts to current conflicts. It highlights that geopolitical changes are often accompanied by uncertainty, fear, insecurity, and bloodshed, but also bring new ideological constructs that shape strategic landscapes for decades or centuries. The article references the Thirty Years' War and the Peace of Westphalia, which introduced the concept of \"raison d'\u00e9tat\" (reason of state) by Cardinal Richelieu, emphasizing national interest over universal morality. It also discusses the balance of power concept, used by European politicians like Prince von Metternich to maintain harmony in Europe.\n\nThe article applies these historical concepts to modern conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war, where Russia's actions reflect \"raison d'\u00e9tat\" and balance of power concerns. Similarly, in the Israel-Hamas conflict, Israel's actions are seen as efforts to neutralize threats, albeit with significant violence. In the context of China, its aggressive stance and power play in the Indo-Pacific region are driven by realpolitik and economic growth, with counterbalances from groups like the Quad and AUKUS to prevent excessive Chinese influence.\n\nThe author, Manish Tewari, concludes that while circumstances and times change, fundamental geopolitical concepts remain relevant.",

The attacks occurred as Russia attempts to push back Ukrainian forces along a 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front. Russia has intensified airstrikes targeting Ukraine's resources, energy facilities, and other critical infrastructure. Governor Vadym Filaskin reported that five people were injured in shelling in the village of New York in Donetsk, and that Russian forces have shelled populated areas 13 times in the past 24 hours.",

        "summary": "In a significant attack by Russia on the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, 12 civilians were killed and 10 injured. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that due to Russian attacks, Ukraine has lost about 80% of its thermal energy capacity and one-third of its hydroelectric capacity. He emphasized the need for more air defense systems from Ukraine's allies.\n\nZaporizhzhia Governor Ivan Fedorov reported that the attack occurred in the city center during a holiday, targeting civilians and damaging infrastructure, shops, and residential buildings. Additionally, a Russian attack on the nearby city of Vynnyansk resulted in the deaths of 12 people, including two children, and injured at least 10 others.\n\nIn a related incident, Russian officials reported that a Ukrainian drone attack in Russia's Kursk region killed at least five people, including two children. In Dnipro, rescue workers were clearing debris from a nine-story residential building destroyed by a Russian attack, which resulted in one death and 12 injuries, including a seven-month-old baby.\n\nThese attacks come as Russia continues to deploy its forces across a 1,000-kilometer front and intensifies airstrikes targeting Ukraine's energy production centers and critical infrastructure. The Ukrainian Air Force claimed to have shot down 10 Russian drones overnight.",

        "summary": "Ukraine conducted a drone attack in Russia's Kursk region, resulting in the deaths of at least five people, including two children, according to local Russian officials. Concurrently, in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, rescue workers were clearing debris from a nine-story residential building destroyed by a Russian attack, which killed one person. Regional Governor Serhiy Lysak reported that the attack in Dnipro also injured 12 people, including a 7-month-old baby. These incidents occurred as Russia continues to deploy its forces across a 1,000-kilometer front and intensifies airstrikes targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky highlighted the severe impact on Ukraine's energy capacity and called for more air defense systems from allies. The Ukrainian Air Force claimed to have shot down 10 Russian drones overnight. The ongoing conflict has caused significant damage to both sides, with Ukraine suffering more severely.",

        "summary": "A Ukrainian drone attack in Russia's Kursk region resulted in the deaths of at least five people, including two children, according to local officials. Concurrently, in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, rescue workers were clearing debris from a nine-story residential building destroyed by a Russian attack, which killed one person and injured 12 others, including a seven-month-old baby. These incidents occurred amid Russia's continued military deployment across a 1,000-kilometer front and intensified airstrikes targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky highlighted the significant loss of the country's thermal and hydroelectric capacity due to these attacks and emphasized the need for more air defense systems from Ukraine's allies. The Ukrainian Air Force reported downing 10 Russian drones overnight.",

        "summary": "Former G20 Sherpa for India, Amitabh Kant, revealed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi threatened to withdraw India from the G20 if consensus on the New Delhi Declaration was not reached. This disclosure was made during the launch of Ramaswami Balasubramaniam's book \"Power Within: The Leadership Legacy of Narendra Modi.\" The declaration faced potential deadlock due to Western countries, including the U.S., wanting to blame Russia for the Ukraine war, which India opposed. Ultimately, the declaration mentioned the Ukraine war without naming Russia, marking a significant diplomatic win for India. Modi emphasized ambitious, inclusive, and decisive actions, leading to consensus on 83 paragraphs and 212 conclusions after extensive negotiations. The book analyzes Modi's leadership inspired by Indian principles.",

The conflict has devastated both countries, resulting in thousands of deaths, including many women and children. Despite multiple attempts by other nations to mediate peace over the past two years, these efforts have been unsuccessful. Zelensky is optimistic that his new plan will receive support from the majority of the world's countries. This development has been confirmed by news channel Al Jazeera.",

        "summary": "In the first presidential debate between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, both leaders exchanged sharp criticisms. Post-debate, Biden expressed his determination to defeat Trump in the upcoming November election, despite acknowledging his own physical and verbal limitations due to age. Biden's performance raised concerns among some Democrats about his fitness for another term, though key figures like former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama continue to support him. The debate's viewership was significantly lower than in 2020, with only 48 million viewers. Trump, meanwhile, claimed a significant victory and suggested the debate could boost his chances in traditionally Democratic states like Virginia.",

        "summary": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi once threatened to withdraw India from the G-20 group, as revealed by India's G-20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant during the launch of his book \"Power Within: The Leadership Legacy of Narendra Modi.\" Kant shared several personal anecdotes about Modi, including the intense negotiations during the 2023 G-20 summit amidst the Russia-Ukraine war. Modi demanded consensus on a joint declaration, threatening to exit the G-20 otherwise. His stature and reputation helped resolve last-minute issues.\n\nAjay Piramal of the Piramal Group recounted Modi's dedication, highlighting a five-hour marathon meeting with economists and industry experts in 2013 without taking a break. Kant also shared how Modi's insistence on promoting digital payments post-demonetization led to significant advancements in India's digital transaction system.\n\nThe event also featured insights from IIM Bangalore Professor B. Mahadevan, who discussed leadership qualities, drawing parallels from the Bhagavad Gita.",

        "summary": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump held his first public campaign in Chesapeake, criticizing current President Joe Biden. The event, held at Greenbrier Farm, saw a large turnout, with people lining up 15 hours in advance. Trump labeled Biden as the worst president, accusing him of using law enforcement against political rivals and failing in international relations. He promised tax cuts and criticized Biden's handling of immigration and crime. Trump also discussed various issues like NATO funding, the economy, and climate change, while vowing to start the largest deportation in U.S. history if re-elected. The campaign follows a 90-minute presidential debate between Trump and Biden, covering topics like the Israel-Hamas conflict, Russia-Ukraine war, and domestic issues.",

        "summary": "In a televised debate for the U.S. presidential race, most viewers perceived former President Donald Trump as having performed better than current President Joe Biden. This contrasts with the 2020 debates where Biden was seen as the stronger candidate. The 90-minute debate covered topics such as the economy, immigration, foreign policy, abortion, and national security. Trump criticized Biden's handling of the U.S. border and economy, while Biden accused Trump of lying and questioned his moral integrity. A CNN flash survey indicated that 67% of viewers thought Trump performed better. The debate raised concerns among Democratic leaders about Biden's ability to lead in the upcoming election. Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged Biden's slow start but emphasized his strong finish. The debate took place before either candidate was officially nominated by their respective parties.",

        "summary": "In the recent U.S. presidential debate, Republican candidate Donald Trump criticized President Joe Biden, accusing him of being more aligned with Palestinians than supporting Israel. Trump argued that Biden's administration has mishandled the Russia-Ukraine war, spending $200 billion on Ukraine without achieving victory. The debate also touched on the Israel-Hamas conflict, where Trump claimed Biden does not want to save Israel. Additionally, the candidates' ages were discussed, with Trump, 78, challenging 82-year-old Biden to a golf match to prove their fitness. Trump also accused Biden of using performance-enhancing drugs, demanding a drug test before further debates.",

        "summary": "In the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election in November, Democratic candidate Joe Biden and Republican candidate Donald Trump are intensifying their campaigns following their first presidential debate. The debate, held in Atlanta and organized by CNN, lasted 90 minutes and covered a range of issues including the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war, U.S.-China relations, abortion, gun violence, taxes, inflation, unemployment, climate change, and illegal immigration.\n\nPost-debate, Biden is set to hold a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, featuring performances by artists Fat Joe and E-40, and appearances by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and Attorney General Josh Stein.\n\nDuring the debate, Biden criticized Trump for leaving behind a struggling economy and highlighted his own achievements in job creation and controlling drug prices. Trump countered by accusing Biden of allowing a surge in illegal immigration. Trump also attacked Biden's handling of the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan, calling it shameful and criticizing the loss of military equipment and lives.\n\nOn the Russia-Ukraine war, Trump accused Biden of failing to prevent the conflict and claimed that he would have deterred Russian aggression. Trump also promised to end the war if elected.",

        "summary": "In the first presidential debate of the final phase of the 2024 US Presidential Election, President Joe Biden faced off against former President Donald Trump. The debate covered key issues such as the economy, immigration, public safety, the Gaza conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war, abortion laws, and the China-Taiwan dispute. Biden's performance was widely criticized, with commentators from both political sides expressing concerns. Some Democrats are now questioning Biden's viability as a candidate against Trump.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama's advisor Van Jones described Biden's performance as \"painful,\" while Eurasia Group's Ian Bremmer noted that Trump appeared \"lively and confident,\" whereas Biden seemed \"inconsistent.\" Vice President Kamala Harris attempted to reassure Democrats, asserting that they would ultimately prevail despite a slow start.\n\nThe debate also highlighted concerns about the candidates' ages, with Biden at 81 and Trump at 78. Biden struggled with his delivery, making several errors and appearing less assertive compared to Trump. The Democratic National Convention, where the party officially nominates its candidates, is just two months away, leaving limited time for any potential changes in candidacy. The next and final debate is scheduled for September.",

        "summary": "In a heated 90-minute presidential debate held in Atlanta, Democratic candidate Joe Biden and Republican candidate Donald Trump clashed on various critical issues ahead of the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November. Key topics of contention included the Russia-Ukraine war, U.S.-China relations, abortion, gun violence, taxes, inflation, unemployment, climate change, and illegal immigration.\n\nTrump targeted Biden's son, Hunter Biden, over his legal troubles, while Biden accused Trump of leaving the economy in disarray and benefiting only the wealthy. Trump labeled Biden as a \"Manchurian candidate\" influenced by China and criticized his handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Biden countered by claiming no U.S. soldiers died under his administration, a statement fact-checked as inaccurate.\n\nBiden also attacked Trump's character by bringing up his alleged involvement in an adult scandal. The debate highlighted the deep divisions and intense rivalry between the two candidates, with significant implications for the upcoming election.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nThe export business in Moradabad, known for its brass handicrafts, has seen a significant decline over the past five months, with exports dropping by over 40%. This downturn is attributed to ongoing global conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, and the economic recession in the US. These factors have led to increased container rates and raw material costs. Moradabad, which typically exports goods worth 8,000 to 9,000 crore INR annually, with 60-70% going to the US, is now facing severe challenges. Exporters and artisans are deeply concerned, hoping for an end to the conflicts to revive their business.",

        "summary": "The opinion piece by Prabhunath Shukla in Haribhoomi emphasizes the importance of maintaining the dignity of the Indian Parliament. It criticizes the behavior of newly elected MPs during the 18th Lok Sabha oath-taking ceremony, highlighting that their actions often crossed constitutional boundaries and lacked respect for parliamentary decorum. Key points include:\n\n1. **Disrespectful Behavior**: MPs displayed behavior that was seen as disrespectful to the Constitution and parliamentary traditions. This included shouting regional, caste-based, and religious slogans instead of focusing on national unity.\n   \n2. **Specific Incidents**: \n   - Asaduddin Owaisi from AIMIM raised slogans like \"Jai Bhim, Jai Meem, Jai Telangana, Jai Palestine\" instead of \"Bharat Mata ki Jai\" or \"Constitution Zindabad.\"\n   - Rahul Gandhi, elected as the leader of the opposition, took his oath in English and shouted \"Jai Constitution,\" which was seen as immature.\n   - BJP MPs used religious slogans, such as \"Jai Hindu Rashtra\" and \"Jai Shri Ram,\" which were opposed by other parties.\n   - Other MPs from various parties also raised slogans promoting regionalism and casteism.\n\n3. **Implications**: The article argues that such behavior undermines the unity and dignity of the Parliament and reflects poorly on the country's democratic values. It calls for the establishment of guidelines to ensure that oath-taking ceremonies respect the Constitution and national unity, avoiding divisive slogans.\n\n4. **Call to Action**: The author urges the government and opposition to discuss and implement rules during the monsoon session to preserve the sanctity of parliamentary proceedings.\n\nThe piece concludes by stressing that the behavior of MPs during the oath-taking ceremony should reflect their responsibility towards the nation, the Constitution, and the Parliament.",

        "summary": "In a 90-minute debate held at CNN's studio in Atlanta, Democrat President Joe Biden and Republican former President Donald Trump clashed on key issues such as the economy, foreign policy, immigration, and abortion. \n\n**Economy:** Biden criticized Trump's handling of the economy and COVID-19, highlighting increased unemployment and national debt during Trump's tenure. Trump proposed a 10% tariff increase to protect American interests, despite warnings from economists about potential trade relationship damage.\n\n**Foreign Policy:** The debate intensified over the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump called it a disgrace, while Biden defended his actions, recalling his late son Beau's military service. Trump claimed he would have prevented Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Hamas's attacks on Israel.\n\n**Immigration:** Trump accused Biden of failing to secure the southern border, leading to increased crime. Biden countered that Trump spreads misinformation about immigration.\n\n**Abortion:** Biden attacked Trump for supporting abortion bans, especially affecting rape victims, and referenced Trump's scandal with Stormy Daniels. Trump denied the affair and argued that abortion issues should be managed by states.\n\nThe debate ended without the traditional handshake, reflecting the ongoing tension between the two candidates.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the recent concerns expressed by the U.S. Secretary of State regarding India's increasing hate speech, religious discrimination, and anti-conversion laws. This comes ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's planned visit to Russia on July 8. The U.S. is reportedly uneasy about the growing India-Russia relationship, especially in light of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Russia. Despite these sanctions, India has continued to strengthen its trade and political ties with Russia, including importing oil at record low prices and engaging in energy and military collaborations. The U.S. is also concerned about the use of Iran's port for coal shipments between India and Russia, which could increase Iran's strategic importance. Modi's upcoming visit to Russia is expected to further solidify the India-Russia relationship, marking a significant development since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war.",

        "summary": "In a recent debate between Republican and Democratic candidates for the U.S. presidential election, President Joe Biden struggled significantly, while Donald Trump was notably aggressive. Trump criticized Biden's policies, handling of the migration crisis, and the Russia-Ukraine war. Biden appeared nervous and made several errors, causing concern and dissatisfaction within the Democratic Party. With less than four months until the election, experts suggest Biden might be asked to withdraw his candidacy. CNN's John King reported that some Democrats are considering asking Biden to step down, while others are contemplating speaking out publicly. The debate highlighted deep anxiety among Democratic strategists, elected members, and fundraisers about Biden's performance, fearing it could harm the party. A particularly notable moment was when Biden froze for about nine seconds, raising questions about his capabilities. Trump claimed that Biden's actions have brought the world closer to a third world war. The debate has sparked discussions within the Democratic Party about potentially replacing Biden as their candidate.",

        "summary": "In a heated US presidential debate ahead of the November elections, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump clashed on various issues without even shaking hands. Key topics included illegal immigration, abortion, the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war, relations with Russia and China, gun violence, taxes, inflation, unemployment, and climate change. Trump criticized Biden's immigration policies and blamed him for the rise in crime rates and the Russia-Ukraine war. Biden defended his policies and accused Trump of giving Putin a free pass on Ukraine. The debate also touched on Trump's criminal charges and his alleged comments about fallen soldiers. Biden's health and age were questioned, with Trump asserting his own fitness. The debate saw intense exchanges on the Israel-Palestine conflict, with Biden reaffirming support for Israel and Trump criticizing the US's role in Ukraine.",

Trump also claimed that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if he were still in office, asserting that Russian President Vladimir Putin respected him. In response, Biden defended his stance on NATO, highlighting that a significant majority of Americans view NATO membership positively. The debate focused heavily on foreign policy, particularly the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.",

        "summary": "In the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election in November, the first presidential debate between Democratic candidate Joe Biden and Republican candidate Donald Trump took place in Atlanta, organized by CNN. The 90-minute debate covered key issues such as the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war, abortion, gun violence, taxes, inflation, unemployment, climate change, and immigration.\n\nNotably, Biden and Trump did not shake hands at the start of the debate. Biden greeted Trump with a \"hello,\" but Trump did not respond. The debate began with the issue of rising inflation in the U.S. Biden accused Trump of leaving behind a struggling economy and claimed to have created numerous jobs and controlled rising drug prices. In response, Trump criticized the Biden administration for the influx of illegal immigrants. Trump also attacked Biden over the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, calling it a disgrace.",

        "summary": "In a recent development, the U.S. has accused China of making a significant mistake by providing military and technical assistance to Russia in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. U.S. Ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, revealed in a speech in Shanghai that China has been supplying Russia with missiles, weapons, and other technological components, which he described as a grave error. Burns emphasized that this support contradicts China's long-standing principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Despite China's claims of not providing direct military aid to Russia, it has maintained strong trade relations and frequent meetings between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The U.S. revelation comes amid already strained U.S.-China relations over issues like Taiwan and Tibet. The key question now is whether the U.S. and NATO will take significant action against China for its involvement in the conflict.",

The Russian Defense Ministry reported that they used hypersonic Kinzhal missiles and other weapons to strike these airfields. The objective is to destroy all aircraft and assistance Ukraine receives from NATO countries. This escalation aims to cripple Ukraine's defense capabilities by preemptively eliminating support from allied nations.",

        "summary": "The first presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump for the 2024 US Presidential Elections will be held on Friday, November 5. The 90-minute debate will be broadcast live on CNN from a TV studio, a format being used for the first time in 64 years. The debate will cover key issues such as the Israel-Gaza conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war, US-China business relations, climate change, immigration, abortion, health policy, tax systems, crime rates, gun laws, and the preservation of US democracy.\n\nJoe Biden won the toss and chose to stand on the left side of the stage. The debate will not have an audience or a journalist panel to avoid disturbances. The winner of the debate will be determined based on news channel analyses, opinion polls, social media reactions, and voting intention surveys.\n\nA second debate is scheduled for September 10, hosted by ABC, and the Vice Presidential debate is tentatively set for either July 23 or August 13. Kamala Harris has agreed to participate, but Trump has not yet announced his Vice Presidential candidate.",

        "summary": "NATO has announced its new Secretary General, Mark Rutte, who will assume the position on October 1. Rutte, the outgoing Prime Minister of the Netherlands, will succeed Jens Stoltenberg, who has held the role for 10 years. Despite being a founding member of NATO, the United States has never held the Secretary General position but consistently controls the Allied Command Operations (ACO) post, responsible for planning and executing operations among member countries. The current Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) is General Christopher G. Cavoli of the U.S. Army. NATO, which has been in the spotlight due to the Russia-Ukraine war, now includes 32 member countries, with recent additions like Sweden and Finland.",

        "summary": "Russia has indicated it may reduce diplomatic relations with Western countries due to their involvement in the ongoing Ukraine war. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that this consideration is a response to the deep involvement of the U.S. and its allies in the conflict. He mentioned that it is standard practice to lower diplomatic relations with unfriendly nations and that Russia is exploring various options, though no decision has been made yet.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war began on February 24, 2022, following an announcement by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The conflict has divided the world, with NATO countries supporting Ukraine and nations like China, South Korea, and Iran indirectly backing Russia. India has remained neutral, advocating for an end to the war.\n\nAdditionally, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Russia on July 8-9 for a bilateral summit with President Putin, which is part of India's strategic considerations amid the escalating conflict. Preparations for the visit are underway, though official confirmation is pending.",

        "summary": "The Russia-Ukraine war, ongoing for nearly two years, remains unresolved with significant casualties on both sides. Russia, showing no signs of ending the conflict, has started recruiting its citizens into the military. A senior Russian officer revealed that around 10,000 civilians have been sent to fight in Ukraine. Additionally, Russia faces accusations of pressuring Central Asian migrants to join its military.\n\nAlexander Bastrykin, head of Russia's Investigative Committee, stated that Russia is taking action against migrants who obtained Russian citizenship but failed to register with military officials. He mentioned that over 30,000 such individuals have been identified and added to a list. Bastrykin confirmed that nearly 10,000 civilians have already been deployed to the conflict zone.\n\nMany Central Asian migrants in Russia, often working low-wage jobs, have been granted easier access to Russian citizenship, which simplifies bureaucratic processes but also obligates them to military service. Amid increased inspections, some migrants have started leaving the country. Anti-migrant sentiment in Russia has intensified, especially after a terrorist attack in Moscow in March that killed over 140 people.",

        "summary": "The diamond industry, with an annual turnover of \u20b970,000 crore, is seeking significant tax relief and subsidies in the upcoming Budget 2024. The industry, which employs millions and polishes 80% of the world's rough diamonds, has been impacted by a 30% drop in imports from Russia due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This has led to an eightfold increase in synthetic diamond production. The industry is urging the Finance Minister to remove the 10% commercial tax, provide subsidies for machinery purchases and electricity bills, and promote lab-grown diamonds. Key figures like diamond unit owner Jitubhai Mordia and Sardar Patel Diamond Association President Narsingh Patel emphasize the need for these measures to sustain and grow the industry. The sector also seeks policy changes and economic support to overcome current challenges and continue its growth trajectory.",

        "summary": "In a speech in Shanghai, U.S. Ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, criticized China for aiding Russia in the Russia-Ukraine war, calling it a \"big mistake.\" Burns highlighted that China's support, including supplying technology, microprocessors, and nitrocellulose to Russia, has exacerbated the conflict, which poses an existential crisis for Europe. He emphasized that China is not neutral in this war and has effectively supported Russia, contradicting its stance on sovereignty and territorial integrity. The speech underscored the deepening ties between China and Russia since the war began, with China becoming Russia's largest trade partner and major importer of gas and oil. Despite these remarks, China has not yet responded to Burns' comments.",

        "summary": "Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Group is currently facing a shortage of 45,000 workers and engineers, as stated by the group's Chairman, S N Subramanyan. The engineering, procurement, and construction sectors are short by 25,000-30,000 workers, while the IT and IT-enabled services sectors lack 20,000 engineers. Honorary Chairman A M Naik mentioned that many Indians are seeking higher-paying jobs in conflict-affected regions like Russia-Ukraine and Israel. This workforce challenge is not new; last year, despite hiring over 30,000 workers, the company still faced difficulties. Subramanyan attributed the shortage to the high demand for certain skills, project execution pressures, and factors like elections and weather instability. The company is addressing these issues by providing transportation, nutritious food, and beverages to employees, and has established skill centers to mitigate the problem.",

        "summary": "Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Group is currently facing a shortage of 45,000 workers and engineers, as stated by Chairman S N Subrahmanyan. The engineering, procurement, and construction sector is short of 25,000-30,000 workers, while the IT and IT-enabled services sector lacks 20,000 engineers. Honorary Chairman A M Naik attributed this shortage to Indian workers seeking higher-paying opportunities in conflict-affected regions like Russia-Ukraine and Israel. This workforce challenge is not new; similar issues were reported last year despite hiring over 30,000 workers. Contributing factors include a demand for scarce skills, project execution pressures, and weather-related disruptions. L&T is addressing these issues by providing transportation, nutritious food, and health facilities to its employees, and through skill centers and other initiatives.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nMark Rutte, the outgoing Prime Minister of the Netherlands, has been appointed as the new Secretary-General of NATO by the alliance's 32 member countries. He will take over from Jens Stoltenberg on October 1, 2024, ahead of a NATO summit in Washington. Rutte's appointment comes at a critical time with Russia advancing in Ukraine and upcoming U.S. elections. Russia has responded strongly, asserting that the U.S. controls NATO and that Rutte's appointment will not change NATO's policy towards Russia. NATO has recently strengthened its security in Eastern Europe and included Sweden and Finland as new members. Rutte, who resigned as Dutch Prime Minister in July 2023, will lead NATO, an alliance formed in 1949 to counter Soviet expansion, now comprising 32 countries. NATO has been a significant supporter of Ukraine, especially since Russia's invasion in 2022.",

        "summary": "NATO has appointed outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as its new chief, succeeding Jens Stoltenberg on October 1. This appointment comes amid Russia's ongoing aggression in Ukraine and upcoming U.S. elections. Stoltenberg, who extended his term due to the Ukraine crisis, welcomed Rutte as a strong leader and consensus builder. U.S. President Joe Biden and other leaders will formally welcome Rutte at a summit in Washington in July.\n\nIn response, Russia emphasized that the U.S. remains in control of NATO, dismissing the significance of the new appointment. NATO has recently strengthened its security in Eastern Europe and included Sweden and Finland as new members following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Rutte, who resigned as Dutch PM last July, will now lead the 32-member alliance, which was originally formed in 1949 to counter Soviet expansion. NATO continues to support Ukraine's defense and its right to choose its security arrangements, with Ukraine's future seen as aligned with NATO.",

        "summary": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit Russia next month for the India-Russia Annual Summit, where he will meet President Vladimir Putin. This visit is significant as it marks Modi's first trip to Moscow since the Russia-Ukraine war began. Despite international pressure and sanctions on Russia, India has maintained its friendship with Russia, supporting it during the conflict. Modi's decision to visit Putin instead of attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in Kazakhstan, where he would have met Chinese President Xi Jinping, sends a strategic message. Modi aims to demonstrate India's independent foreign policy and solidify its ties with Russia, countering China's growing influence over Russia. This move is expected to increase tensions with China, especially since Modi is skipping the SCO Summit due to issues with China and Pakistan. The visit underscores India's commitment to its longstanding relationship with Russia, which has been a key defense supplier and trade partner.",

        "summary": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit Russia next month to meet with President Vladimir Putin. This visit is significant as it will be Modi's first trip to Russia since the Ukraine war began, and the global community is closely watching the outcomes. Experts suggest that Modi might discuss the Ukraine conflict with Putin. The visit is scheduled for July, following an invitation from Putin in March. The two leaders are expected to discuss various bilateral issues, including trade and technology. Despite the Ukraine war, India has maintained strong relations with Russia and has not condemned Russia's actions, advocating for a diplomatic resolution instead.",

        "summary": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit Russia next month, marking his first trip to the country in nearly five years. The Kremlin announced the visit, with Yuri Ushakov, a foreign affairs aide to President Vladimir Putin, confirming preparations are underway, though specific dates have not been disclosed. This visit, if it occurs, will be for the annual India-Russia summit, the first since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The last summit was held in New Delhi in December 2021. \n\nThe visit comes amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has resulted in the deaths of four Indian citizens fighting for the Russian army. India has requested a halt to the recruitment of its citizens by the Russian military. Despite international pressure, India has continued to purchase Russian crude oil to manage domestic prices, reflecting its longstanding strategic partnership with Russia.",

        "summary": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit Russia in July, marking his first visit since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war. Although the Indian Ministry of External Affairs has not confirmed the visit, preparations are underway in both countries. This visit follows an invitation from Russia, as mentioned by the Kremlin in March. Reports suggest that Modi may visit Moscow on July 8 for a one-day trip, but official confirmation is pending. \n\nEarlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Modi on his third term during a phone call. Modi last visited Russia in September 2019, while Putin visited India in 2021 for the annual India-Russia summit. Their last meeting was in September 2022 at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Uzbekistan, where they discussed the Ukraine conflict.\n\nAdditionally, Russia is hosting the BRICS summit in Kazan in October, which Modi is expected to attend. The visit underscores the longstanding friendship between India and Russia, with India being a major purchaser of Russian arms.",

This visit, if confirmed, would be the first by an Indian Prime Minister to Russia in nearly five years, with Modi's last visit occurring in September 2019. The trip is being planned for the annual India-Russia summit, a key event for high-level strategic dialogue between the two nations. Kremlin official Yuri Ushakov confirmed preparations for Modi's visit. The last summit was held in New Delhi on December 6, 2021, attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

        "summary": "Asle Toje, Deputy Leader of the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee, stated that India will become the world's largest economy by 2050, surpassing China, the United States, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil, and Russia. Toje, a renowned political scientist and international relations expert, emphasized India's readiness to become a global superpower. He highlighted the importance of addressing global climate change and suggested that India should promote peace and reduce suffering rather than imposing its ideals on others.\n\nRajiv Kumar, former Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog and founder of the India Foundation, stressed the need for a unique development approach for India, focusing on rapid growth while reducing carbon footprints, a feat not previously achieved by any country.\n\nRegarding the Russia-Ukraine war, Toje criticized the failure of diplomacy, noting that the West did not recognize Russia's legitimate geopolitical interests, leading to the conflict. He warned that the ongoing war could ultimately fracture Europe.",

        "summary": "The Union Budget for 2024-25 is set to be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman by the end of July 2024. This comes amidst global uncertainties, potential economic slowdowns in the US and Europe, and ongoing conflicts in regions like Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine. The budget aims to balance bold initiatives with fiscal prudence, following the Modi government's third consecutive electoral mandate.\n\nKey discussions in pre-budget meetings with corporate representatives included reducing income tax burdens, increasing capital expenditure, and controlling food inflation. Emphasis was also placed on infrastructure development and strengthening the MSME sector, crucial for economic growth and employment.\n\nThe first session of the 18th Lok Sabha began on June 24, 2024, and will run until July 3, 2024, during which the budget date is expected to be clarified. President Droupadi Murmu will address a joint session of both houses on June 27, 2024.\n\nThe Economic Survey, prepared under Chief Economic Advisor Dr. V. Anantha Nageswaran, will provide an annual review of the country's economic progress and challenges. An interim budget was presented on February 1, 2024, to cover expenses until the new government took office. The comprehensive budget for the remaining fiscal year will be presented in July.\n\nThe fiscal deficit, representing the gap between the government's total revenue and expenditure within a financial year, highlights the extent to which government spending exceeds its earnings, excluding borrowings.",

        "summary": "In May 2024, India's import of gems and jewellery surged by 23.61% compared to the previous year, reaching \u20b915,794.26 crore (approximately $1,894.4 million USD). However, exports in the same sector saw a decline, dropping to \u20b920,713.37 crore (around $2,484.48 million USD) from \u20b921,795.65 crore (about $2,646.92 million USD) in May 2023. Colin Shah, MD of Kama Jewellery, attributed this decline to economic instability and geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict, which have negatively impacted overseas demand. Additionally, the upcoming elections in over 60 countries, including India and Italy, have also affected trade. Despite these challenges, there is optimism for increased trade activity during the upcoming festive season.",

Additionally, there is tension between North and South Korea. The article suggests that if these conflicts escalate, a third world war could occur, especially considering many countries possess nuclear weapons.

This initiative began in response to the Russia-Ukraine war. As a result, the RBI has brought back 47% of its gold reserves to India, leaving only 53% still held abroad. As of March 2024, the RBI's total gold reserves stood at 822.1 tons.",

        "summary": "In the past four months, Russia has experienced two significant terrorist attacks, raising questions about President Vladimir Putin's ability to handle the situation amidst the ongoing war with Ukraine. The first attack occurred on March 22 at Moscow's Crocus City Hall, resulting in 145 deaths and over 500 injuries. The second attack took place on June 24 in two cities in Dagestan, killing 17 and injuring more than 25 people. These incidents suggest that terrorist organizations in Dagestan might be receiving external support.\n\nPutin, who has been in power for 24 years and recently won his fifth presidential term on March 17, 2024, with 87% of the vote, has been engaged in the war with Ukraine since February 22, 2022. Despite significant losses, Ukraine continues to resist, bolstered by substantial support from NATO countries, particularly the United States. The prolonged conflict has damaged Putin's international image and strained Russia's relations with Western nations, leading to various sanctions.\n\nPutin has warned NATO against direct confrontation, suggesting it could lead to World War III, but also stated that Russia has no plans to attack NATO countries unless provoked by actions such as the deployment of F-16 fighter jets in Ukraine. The war shows no signs of ending soon, with neither Putin achieving a decisive victory nor Ukrainian President Zelensky conceding defeat.",

        "summary": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is rapidly repatriating its gold reserves from abroad, resulting in the lowest level of overseas gold holdings in six years. As of March 2024, 47% of India's total gold reserves were held abroad, the lowest since December 2017. The RBI had accelerated gold purchases in December 2017 and is now focused on bringing more of this gold back to India.\n\nRecently, the RBI made headlines by repatriating a significant amount of gold from the UK, approximately 100 tons. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das stated that this move is not unexpected, citing increased domestic storage capacity as the reason.\n\nHowever, market analysts link this strategy to the Russia-Ukraine war, noting that Western countries, led by the U.S., imposed economic sanctions on Russia and seized its foreign assets. The RBI aims to preemptively safeguard India's assets from similar risks.\n\nAs part of its strategy to bolster foreign exchange reserves, the RBI has purchased record amounts of gold in recent years. By March, the RBI held over 822 tons of gold, with 53% now stored domestically, up from 39% in September 2021.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nOn Sunday, Ukraine launched attacks on two Russian cities, Sevastopol in Crimea and the southern Belgorod region. In Sevastopol, two people, including a two-year-old child, were killed, and 22 others were injured due to missile fragments. The attack involved five missiles intercepted by Russian air defense, but debris caused damage and fires. In Belgorod, a drone attack killed one person and injured three. These attacks followed a Russian assault on Kharkiv, Ukraine, which resulted in three deaths and around 30 injuries. The ongoing conflict began on February 24, 2022, when Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine, leading to global divisions and support for Ukraine from NATO countries, while Russia received indirect support from nations like China and Iran. India has remained neutral, advocating for an end to the war.",

        "summary": "A viral video from the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict shows a dramatic incident involving Russian soldiers. In the video, three Russian soldiers are walking across a field when a small drone attacks the middle soldier, causing a severe injury. The injured soldier, realizing his critical condition, signals his comrade to shoot him in the head to avoid capture and potential torture by Ukrainian forces. The comrade complies, shooting the injured soldier at point-blank range before moving on.\n\nUkraine has been using small drones, referred to as FPV attacks, to target Russian soldiers, vehicles, and tanks. The conflict has resulted in significant casualties, with estimates suggesting over 500,000 Russian soldiers and more than 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died. The war has caused substantial losses for both sides, with Ukraine receiving continuous support from Western countries in the form of money and weapons.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the escalating global threat of nuclear warfare, highlighting several key regions and actors:\n\n1. **Russia**: President Putin has expressed willingness to use nuclear weapons and has strengthened ties with North Korea, which is developing destructive bombs. This has heightened global fears of a nuclear conflict.\n\n2. **Iran and the Middle East**: Iran's nuclear ambitions are a significant concern. Experts warn that if Iran develops nuclear weapons, it could trigger a regional arms race. The future stance of Iran's leadership on nuclear policy remains uncertain.\n\n3. **South Asia**: The ongoing tensions between nuclear-armed Pakistan, India, and China could potentially lead to a nuclear war. Pakistan is prepared to use nuclear weapons first, while India is enhancing its missile capabilities. Historical conflicts and recent incidents, like India's accidental missile launch into Pakistan, exacerbate these risks.\n\n4. **Pakistan**: Beyond its conflict with India, Pakistan's political instability and presence of terrorist groups pose a global threat. There are concerns about the control of nuclear weapons in the event of a leadership change or coup.\n\n5. **Russia-Ukraine War**: The conflict has persisted for two years, with Western support for Ukraine angering Russia. Experts fear that if Russia feels it is losing, it might resort to using tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n6. **North Korea**: Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un continues to expand North Korea's nuclear capabilities, posing a threat to the US and Western countries. North Korea reportedly has around 50 nuclear weapons, with the potential to increase this number.\n\nThe article underscores the precarious state of global security due to the proliferation and potential use of nuclear weapons by various nations.",

        "summary": "A video from the Russia-Ukraine war has surfaced, showing three Russian soldiers walking through an open field when a small drone attacks the middle soldier, causing a severe injury. The injured soldier, in a display of immense courage, signals his comrade to shoot him in the head to avoid capture and torture. The comrade complies, shooting him with an AK-series assault rifle.\n\nThe war has resulted in significant casualties and losses for both sides. Reports suggest that around 500,000 Russian soldiers and 50,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died, though these figures are unverified. Russia has also lost substantial military equipment, including tanks, aircraft, and drones. The ongoing conflict has led to the creation of over 70 new cemeteries in Russia since February 2022.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nOn Saturday, Russia launched another attack on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, resulting in three deaths and around 30 injuries. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shared an image of a damaged building on social media and urged international partners to take decisive actions against Russian aggression. Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko confirmed the casualties and infrastructure damage. Additionally, Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure with missiles and drones, marking the eighth significant attack on such facilities in three months. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed they targeted ammunition depots containing Western-supplied weapons. The ongoing conflict, which began on February 24, 2022, has divided global alliances, with NATO countries supporting Ukraine and nations like China and Iran indirectly backing Russia. India has maintained a neutral stance, advocating for an end to the war.",

        "summary": "The NATO Innovation Fund, announced in 2022 amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, aims to address defense and security challenges by investing \u20ac1 billion (approximately \u20b990 billion) in AI, space, and robotic defense technologies. Out of NATO's 32 members, 24 have agreed to invest in four European tech companies: Germany's ARX Robotics, London's Fractile, iComat, and Space Forge. The fund also invests in four venture capital funds focusing on deep tech: Join Capital, Vsquared Ventures, OTB Ventures, and Alpine Space Ventures. The initiative seeks to bridge the gap between military needs and technological innovations, facilitating faster project execution without government delays. However, major NATO countries like the USA, Canada, and France do not support this fund.",

        "summary": "The Indian government has expressed significant concern over the deaths of four Indian citizens who were recruited into the Russian army amidst the Russia-Ukraine conflict. India has demanded action from Moscow, including the immediate release and repatriation of Indian citizens currently serving in the Russian military. Approximately 200 Indians have been recruited as security assistants in the Russian army, and efforts have led to the release and return of 10 individuals so far. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs is also working to repatriate the bodies of the recently deceased Indians and is in contact with their families. Additionally, the ministry refuted claims by French journalist Sebastien Farcis about being forced to leave India, clarifying that his work permit renewal application is still under consideration. The ministry also dismissed an ABC News documentary alleging Indian intelligence interference in Australia's national security as false and aimed at discrediting India.",

This concern arose after two more Indian nationals were reported killed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, bringing the total number of Indian casualties to four. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs, represented by spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, has called for the immediate release and repatriation of Indian citizens recruited by the Russian military and has requested a halt to such recruitment practices.\n\nApproximately 200 Indian citizens have reportedly been recruited as security assistants in the Russian military. So far, efforts have led to the release and return of 10 Indian nationals. India remains in contact with Russian authorities in both New Delhi and Moscow to address this issue.\n\nAdditionally, India is working with Russia to expedite the return of the bodies of the recently deceased Indian nationals. The Ministry of External Affairs is also in touch with the families of the deceased.\n\nIn a separate matter, the Ministry refuted claims by French journalist Sebastien Farcis that he was forced to leave India, clarifying that his work permit renewal application is still under consideration. Farcis, an OCI cardholder, requires approval for journalistic activities under Indian regulations.\n\nFurthermore, the Ministry dismissed an ABC News documentary alleging Indian intelligence agents' interference in Australia's national security as \"blatantly false\" and aimed at discrediting India. The Ministry condemned any attempts to ignore, justify, or glorify terrorism.",

        "summary": "India has expressed \"extreme concern\" over the recruitment of Indian citizens into the Russian army, urging Moscow to take action. The issue gained urgency after two more Indian nationals were reported killed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, bringing the total to four. Approximately 200 Indians have been recruited as security assistants in the Russian army. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, stated that India has requested the immediate release and repatriation of these individuals and demanded a verified halt to further recruitment. So far, 10 Indian citizens have been released and returned. The MEA is also working to repatriate the bodies of the deceased and is in contact with their families.",

        "summary": "India has expressed significant concern over Indian citizens working in the Russian military and has called for action from Moscow. The issue gained urgency after two more Indian nationals were killed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, bringing the total to four. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has requested the release and repatriation of Indian citizens recruited by the Russian military and has demanded a verified halt to such recruitment. Approximately 200 Indians are reportedly working as security assistants in the Russian army. So far, 10 Indian citizens have been released and returned to India. The MEA is also working to repatriate the bodies of the recently deceased Indians and is in contact with their families.\n\nAdditionally, the MEA refuted claims by French journalist Sebastien Farcis that he was forced to leave India, stating his work permit renewal application is still under consideration. The MEA also dismissed an ABC News documentary alleging Indian intelligence agents' interference in Australia's national security as \"blatantly false\" and aimed at discrediting India.",

        "summary": "The article discusses India's diplomatic strategies to counter China's influence. Key points include:\n\n1. **Global Alliances and Tensions**: The U.S. is using the Tibet issue to challenge China, while Russia, China, and North Korea are forming an alliance. Iran and Syria are also aligning with Russia and China. Saudi Arabia seeks independence from U.S. pressure, and Europe is weary of the Ukraine conflict. Israel's Netanyahu is defying U.S. warnings against Hamas.\n\n2. **India's Position**: India has maintained neutrality in the Ukraine war but is aligning with U.S. diplomacy on Tibet. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's warm reception of a U.S. congressional delegation signals this shift. India had recognized Tibet as part of China in 2003, hoping to ease tensions, but China's actions in Doklam and Arunachal Pradesh have kept relations strained.\n\n3. **Diplomatic Moves**: Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar also met with U.S. delegates, indicating India's intent to respond to China. Despite this, India aims to maintain good relations with Russia, as seen in Modi's silence on the Russia-Ukraine war at the G-20 and G-7 summits.\n\n4. **China's Global Influence**: China is expanding its influence in Asia and beyond, controlling key trade routes and ports. The U.S. fears China's growing power and is using India as a strategic base to counter it.\n\n5. **U.S.-India Relations**: The U.S. has used Indian soil to challenge China, with a U.S. delegation visiting the Tibetan government-in-exile in India. This move, while diplomatically sensitive, shows the U.S. leveraging India in its strategy against China.\n\n6. **Strategic Caution for India**: The article advises India to remain non-aligned, given its proximity to China and the complex global dynamics. India's cautious diplomacy with China and Russia has been beneficial and should continue.\n\nIn summary, India is navigating a complex diplomatic landscape, balancing relations with major powers while countering China's regional ambitions.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is set to impose additional financial burdens on his country's wealthy population due to the ongoing Ukraine war. The Russian parliament has given preliminary approval to a bill that plans to increase taxes on the income of the rich. This move comes as Russia enters the third year of its conflict with Ukraine, despite pressure from the U.S. and Western countries. The bill, which passed its first reading in the State Duma, aims to amend the 2001 tax law by introducing a slab tax system. Individuals earning over $27,500 annually will see increased tax rates, with those earning above $573,000 facing a 22% tax rate. Additionally, corporate tax rates will rise from 20% to 25%. This legislation is expected to significantly boost Russia's revenue by $29 billion by 2025, highlighting the economic strain caused by the war and Western sanctions.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the Congress party's protest against irregularities in the NEET and NET exams conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA). Rahul Gandhi criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi, suggesting that while Modi could intervene in the Russia-Ukraine war, he failed to prevent exam paper leaks in India. The Youth Congress, led by Srinivas BV, protested outside the Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan's residence, accusing him of misleading the nation and demanding his resignation and thorough investigation. The Congress party called for the dissolution of the NTA, citing a lack of integrity and repeated exam scandals. They urged the government to review exam-related issues, address complaints, and ensure justice for students under Supreme Court supervision. Rahul Gandhi emphasized the need for honest officials and criticized the government's credibility and responsiveness.",

        "summary": "The article highlights the growing influence of Indian culture, particularly astrology, among Russian youth. Over 60% of young Russians trust \"Kundli remedies\" for solving their problems. Professor Vinay Pandey from BHU's Sanskrit Vidya Dharma Vigyan faculty recently returned from Moscow, where he observed this trend during an international workshop on astrology. Russian youth are increasingly interested in astrological solutions, including mantras and rituals for peace and problem-solving. The lifestyle in Russia, characterized by early independence and a search for stability after a decade of a solitary and unrestrained life, is seen as a reason for this interest. Additionally, Russian women prefer Indian men as life partners, attributing this to the stability and lifelong commitment associated with Indian culture. The spread of Indian knowledge and astrology in Russia is seen as a positive development, with a notable interest in yoga as well.",

        "summary": "The Congress party is staging nationwide protests today against irregularities in the NEET and NET exams. Leaders and workers from the party will hold demonstrations in various parts of the country, including a significant protest in Bhopal addressing issues like the NEET and nursing exam scandals and paper leaks in Madhya Pradesh. Key figures such as Digvijay Singh and Jitu Patwari will participate.\n\nCongress leader Shashi Tharoor criticized the practice of paper leaks, while Rahul Gandhi attacked the Modi government, accusing it of failing to prevent these leaks and alleging that BJP-ruled states have become centers for such issues. Gandhi claimed that the BJP and RSS have taken over educational institutions, leading to ongoing problems. He sarcastically remarked that while PM Modi can intervene in international conflicts, he seems unable or unwilling to stop paper leaks. The INDIA alliance, according to Gandhi, will ensure such issues are addressed.",

        "summary": "The controversy surrounding the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) has intensified following the cancellation of the University Grants Commission National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET) due to alleged irregularities. Students have protested, and opposition leaders have criticized the government, likening the situation to the Vyapam scam and claiming it jeopardizes students' futures. The Ministry of Education is awaiting a report from Bihar Police's Economic Offenses Unit on the alleged irregularities in the NEET exam held in Patna. \n\nKey figures involved include Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who has accused the government of failing to prevent paper leaks and criticized the influence of the BJP and RSS on educational institutions. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Kumar Sinha has linked the main accused in the NEET paper leak to officials associated with RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav. Kerala Chief Minister P. Vijayan and other political leaders have called for immediate action to address the crisis within the National Testing Agency (NTA).\n\nProtests have led to the detention of over two dozen students and members of various student organizations. Calls for the resignation of the Education Minister and the dismantling of the NTA have been made by leaders from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and other opposition parties. The situation has raised significant concerns about the integrity and management of national examinations in India.",

        "summary": "The news article discusses the escalating controversy surrounding the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) due to alleged irregularities, including a paper leak. Students have intensified their protests, and opposition parties have criticized the government, comparing the situation to the Vyapam scam and claiming it jeopardizes students' futures. The University Grants Commission National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET) was canceled, raising questions about the National Testing Agency's (NTA) ability to conduct exams. The Education Ministry is awaiting a report from Bihar Police's Economic Offenses Unit and has summoned NTA's Director-General for discussions. Prominent political figures, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, have condemned the government, alleging BJP and RSS influence over educational institutions. Several students and activists were detained during protests. Various political leaders have called for the NTA's dissolution and the resignation of the Education Minister, demanding compensation for affected students and a review of the current examination system.",

He assured that those responsible will face strict action and announced the formation of a high-level committee to investigate the matter. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also stressed that student interests are paramount and no guilty party will be spared.\n\nEarlier, former Congress President Rahul Gandhi criticized the central government over the alleged paper leaks in UGC-NET and NEET-UG exams, accusing PM Modi of failing to prevent such incidents despite his international diplomatic successes. Gandhi claimed that BJP and its affiliates have taken over educational institutions, leading to these leaks. He vowed that the opposition would raise this issue in the upcoming parliamentary session.\n\nIn response to the controversy, the Education Ministry has canceled the UGC-NET exam conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) and handed the investigation over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).",

        "summary": "The news article discusses the controversy surrounding the NEET exam paper leak in India, which has become a significant issue for the Modi government. Key points include:\n\n1. **NEET Exam Results and Paper Leak**: The NEET exam results were announced on June 4, the same day as the 2024 Lok Sabha election results. The paper leak has caused a nationwide uproar, with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi for failing to prevent the leak.\n\n2. **Political Reactions**: The BJP has attempted to deflect blame onto Bihar's Tejashwi Yadav, while the RJD has questioned the integrity of the National Testing Agency (NTA). The central government has offered affected students the option to retake the exam or proceed without grace marks.\n\n3. **Legal and Investigative Actions**: Multiple petitions have been filed in various High Courts, and the Supreme Court is set to hear the combined cases on July 8. The government has formed a special panel to investigate, and Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has acknowledged the need for reforms in the NTA.\n\n4. **Political Implications**: The issue has provided Rahul Gandhi and the opposition with ammunition to criticize the Modi government, linking it to broader concerns about corruption and mismanagement in educational institutions.\n\n5. **Government's Response**: The government has canceled the UGC-NET exam and is considering re-conducting the NEET exam. The Supreme Court's upcoming decision may lead to further actions against NTA officials.\n\nThe controversy highlights systemic issues in exam administration and has significant political and educational implications.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nFormer Congress President Rahul Gandhi criticized the central government over alleged paper leaks in UGC-NET and NEET-UG exams, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being psychologically broken and more concerned with retaining power than addressing the issue.

        "summary": "In a recent press conference, former Congress President Rahul Gandhi criticized the central government over alleged paper leaks in UGC-NET and NEET-UG exams. He mocked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, claiming that while Modi boasts of stopping the Russia-Ukraine war, he cannot or does not want to stop paper leaks in India. Gandhi asserted that Modi is psychologically broken and more concerned with retaining power than addressing educational issues. He accused the BJP and its affiliates of controlling educational institutions, leading to these leaks. Gandhi also mentioned that the opposition will raise this issue in the upcoming parliamentary session. Following the controversy, the Education Ministry has ordered the cancellation of the UGC-NET exam and handed the investigation over to the CBI.",

        "summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping met again at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, marking their second meeting in two months. This meeting underscores their strategic partnership amid ongoing geopolitical tensions with the West. Experts suggest that while the summit may yield some economic agreements, it is unlikely to significantly boost the domestic economies of China and Russia. The summit also highlights China's efforts to expand its influence through regional forums like the SCO, BRICS, and the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nThe meeting comes at a critical juncture in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, drawing attention from NATO and countries like Japan and Australia. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the security risks posed by the China-Russia alliance and the need for the U.S. to strengthen its alliances in Europe and Asia. Despite the high-profile meeting, experts believe it is improbable that China and Russia will reach a substantial consensus on ending the Russia-Ukraine crisis.\n\nThe SCO, founded by China and Russia in 2001, includes Central Asian countries, India, Iran, and Pakistan. The summit's agenda covers economic, energy, and anti-terrorism issues, along with the Russia-Ukraine war and other geopolitical concerns. However, internal divisions within the \"Global South\" and differing views on opposing developed democratic nations suggest that China's ability to counter Western influence through the SCO remains limited.",

        "summary": "A new conflict is brewing as North Korea prepares to send troops to Ukraine. Following a recent military assistance agreement with Russia, North Korea, under Kim Jong-un's authorization, is dispatching 20,000 soldiers to Eastern Ukraine. Their mission is to bolster Russian military fortifications, indirectly aiding Russia in the conflict. This move has drawn strong opposition from the U.S. and South Korea, and has alarmed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who fears it will further disadvantage Ukraine.\n\nIn response, Zelensky has urgently sought help from China, despite previously criticizing China at the Shangri-La Dialogue. Ukraine plans a major counteroffensive in July, but past engagements have not been favorable. Zelensky's appeal to China highlights the significant global influence China wields, as evidenced by multiple countries' decisions to skip the Swiss Peace Summit after China declined to participate.\n\nZelensky is also concerned about pushing China closer to Russia, but China's stance remains neutral, advocating for a political resolution to the conflict. The article suggests that Ukraine should adopt a more realistic approach, acknowledge Russia's frontline advantage, and engage in negotiations facilitated by neutral countries like China to achieve a peaceful resolution and prevent further casualties.",

        "summary": "Finnish President Alexander Stubb stated that China's significant influence over Russia could potentially end the Ukraine war if President Xi Jinping made a decisive call. However, China has declined this suggestion. Stubb's comments reflect growing frustration among Ukraine's allies over China's perceived support for Russia, including providing military technology and helping circumvent trade restrictions.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning emphasized that China and Russia are independent nations and reiterated China's commitment to peace and dialogue. Despite China's neutral stance, trade between China and Russia has increased, while EU-Russia trade has decreased.\n\nStubb, who took office on March 1, argued that ending Russia's aggression in Ukraine would benefit China by upholding international rules on territorial integrity and sovereignty. He also stressed the need for Europe to support Ukraine militarily and politically, including its aspirations to join the EU and NATO.\n\nStubb highlighted the importance of Europe transitioning to a wartime economy to support defense industries and called for increased European support for Ukraine. He also noted Finland's strategic importance in Europe, given its extensive border with Russia and its recent NATO membership.",

Trump's plan reportedly involves ending the Russia-Ukraine war by having Ukraine cede territory.\n\nZelensky stated that if Trump knows how to end the war, he should share the details immediately so Ukraine can prepare, especially if its independence and statehood are at risk. He emphasized that any proposal must respect Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\nUkraine is firm on not giving up its territory or sovereignty, and NATO is shifting the command of aid to Ukraine from the U.S. to NATO leadership. Despite Trump's potential influence, Europe and Ukraine remain committed to their goals. Ukraine has previously declared its determination to fight, even without aid. If Trump returns to the White House and pressures Ukraine to cede territory, success is not guaranteed.",

        "summary": "In a recent military action, Russian forces destroyed five Ukrainian Su-27 fighter jets using \"Iskander\" tactical missiles at the Mirgorod airport in eastern Ukraine. This attack, which resulted in the complete destruction of two jets and damage to three others, is seen as a significant blow to the Ukrainian Air Force. The timing of the strike coincides with the recent deployment of F-16 fighter jets by Ukraine, marking their first use in the conflict. The Russian attack is perceived as a warning to the capabilities of the F-16s.\n\nHistorically, Ukraine inherited around 77 Su-27s after the Soviet Union's dissolution, but due to economic and military challenges, only about 32 were operational before the war. Over two years of conflict have reduced this number significantly, with only about a dozen remaining before this latest attack.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force has been using a strategy of limited engagement to preserve its remaining aircraft, contrasting with the more frequent sorties by Russian forces. The recent introduction of F-16s, although in limited numbers (4-6 jets), is unlikely to shift the balance of air superiority. The F-16s are primarily intended to launch AIM-120 long-range air-to-air missiles to deter Russian aircraft.\n\nGiven the current situation, Ukraine has requested to station its F-16s in neighboring countries like Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia to protect them from immediate destruction. The article suggests that while the F-16s are advanced, they are not invincible, and their mythologized status may lead to unrealistic expectations.",

        "summary": "Finnish President Alexander Stubb recently stated that Russia's dependence on China has reached a level where a single phone call from Chinese President Xi Jinping could end the Russia-Ukraine war. Stubb emphasized that if Xi were to suggest peace talks, Russia would have no choice but to comply. Ukraine's allies have accused China of providing military technology and components to Russia and helping Moscow circumvent international trade restrictions. Despite this, China maintains a stance of neutrality in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the current Sino-Russian relationship as the best in history, highlighting its importance for global stability. The comments were made ahead of a meeting between Putin and Xi at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Astana, Kazakhstan. The SCO, founded in 2001, includes Russia, China, and several Central Asian countries, with India, Iran, and Pakistan as current members.",

        "summary": "The European Union (EU) has imposed additional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, a move criticized by former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis. He reminded the EU of China's crucial support during the 2008 global financial crisis, which helped Europe recover quickly. Varoufakis argued that the EU's actions are unfair and counterproductive, especially given China's potential to aid Europe's green transition. The tariffs could harm EU-China relations and possibly lead to a trade war, negatively impacting both sides. Critics suggest the EU's decision is influenced by the US and highlights the EU's lack of autonomy.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the recent deployment of 20,000 North Korean soldiers to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has been widely publicized. Russian supporters are optimistic, believing these troops will significantly impact the war in Russia's favor. However, the article argues that the nature of modern warfare, which relies on technology rather than sheer numbers, makes the effectiveness of North Korean troops questionable.\n\nThe article also highlights the strategic alliance between Russia and North Korea, formalized through a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty. This move is seen as a desperate measure by Russia, which has significant diplomatic costs and further damages its international credibility. The alliance is perceived as a poor strategic decision, as it may provoke increased support for Ukraine from countries like South Korea and Japan, who are already concerned about North Korea's military capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the article suggests that the Russia-North Korea alliance and the deployment of North Korean troops are unlikely to change the course of the war and may instead exacerbate geopolitical tensions, ultimately benefiting Ukraine and its allies.",

        "summary": "The news article from \"\u770b\u4e2d\u56fd\" discusses the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war as of July 3, 2024, highlighting several key points:\n\n1. **Russian Casualties**: The Russian military has suffered nearly 550,000 casualties, with 35,030 losses in June 2024 alone. Ukrainian forces, particularly the 47th Brigade, have been effective in combat, significantly depleting Russian troops.\n\n2. **Russian Recruitment Efforts**: Due to heavy losses, Russia is intensifying recruitment efforts, increasing compensation for new soldiers and placing recruitment ads in major cities.\n\n3. **Destruction of Russian Equipment**: Ukrainian forces have successfully destroyed advanced Russian artillery and other military equipment using drones and precision strikes.\n\n4. **Crimea Defense**: Russia is urgently fortifying Crimea, installing air defense systems, which poses risks to local civilians. Despite these efforts, Ukrainian attacks continue to target strategic locations in Crimea.\n\n5. **Ukrainian Advances**: Ukrainian forces are making strategic gains in various regions, including Kharkiv and Bakhmut, using high-precision weaponry and drones to disrupt Russian supply lines and military operations.\n\n6. **Russian Tactical Shifts**: Facing equipment shortages, Russian forces are resorting to unconventional tactics, such as using motorcycles for rapid assaults and ammunition transport, indicating deteriorating conditions.\n\n7. **International Involvement**: The article mentions the potential deployment of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, with NATO support, which could significantly impact the conflict dynamics.\n\nOverall, the article underscores the severe toll on Russian forces, the strategic maneuvers by Ukrainian troops, and the broader implications for the ongoing conflict.",

Key points include:\n\n1. **Russian Casualties**: The Ukrainian military reports that Russian forces have suffered nearly 550,000 casualties, with 35,030 losses in June 2024 alone. The elite Ukrainian 47th Brigade has been particularly effective, killing 975 Russian soldiers in two weeks.\n\n2. **Russian Recruitment Issues**: Evidence suggests that Russia is running out of soldiers, leading to increased recruitment efforts and higher compensation for new recruits.\n\n3. **Destruction of Advanced Artillery**: Ukrainian forces have destroyed advanced Russian artillery using drones, and have successfully targeted a Russian fuel train.\n\n4. **Crimea Defense**: Russia is urgently fortifying Crimea, installing air defense systems, which poses risks to local civilians. Despite militarization, Russia continues to promote tourism in the region.\n\n5. **Ukrainian Airstrikes**: Ukrainian forces have conducted successful airstrikes, including on a Russian base in Crimea and using high-precision bombs in Kharkiv and Bakhmut.\n\n6. **Russian Tactical Shifts**: Russian forces are using motorcycles for rapid movement and supply transport to avoid drone attacks, indicating deteriorating equipment conditions.\n\n7. **International Involvement**: Reports suggest that NATO aircraft, including F-16s, are being deployed to Ukraine, potentially escalating the conflict.\n\nThe article highlights the severe human and material toll of the conflict, the strategic maneuvers by both sides, and the broader geopolitical implications.",

        "summary": "U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a new $2.3 billion security aid package for Ukraine during a meeting with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov at the Pentagon. Umerov expressed gratitude and highlighted the ongoing efforts to secure more air defense systems. Both Austin and Umerov discussed Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO, with Austin supporting the idea and mentioning steps to facilitate Ukraine's membership. The aid package includes anti-tank weapons, air defense interceptors, and expedited procurement of NASAMS and Patriot missile systems. Since 2022, the U.S. has provided over $50 billion in military aid to Ukraine. However, future support may be uncertain if Donald Trump wins the upcoming presidential election, as his advisors propose linking further aid to Ukraine's engagement in peace talks with Russia, potentially altering U.S. policy and facing opposition from European allies and within the Republican Party.",

        "summary": "A major European poll indicates that most European countries now believe negotiations are the best way to end the Russia-Ukraine war, rather than a complete military victory for Ukraine. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to consider a ceasefire to expedite peace talks. During a joint press conference in Kyiv, Orb\u00e1n discussed the potential for a ceasefire to accelerate negotiations, while Zelensky highlighted the possibility of broad bilateral cooperation between Ukraine and Hungary.\n\nThe poll, conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations in May, surveyed 19,566 people across 15 European countries. It revealed that few respondents believe Ukraine can achieve a decisive military victory. Despite setbacks for Russian forces, most European voters support aiding Kyiv, not for a complete victory, but to strengthen Ukraine's position in future negotiations with Russia.\n\nCountries like Estonia believe Ukraine will win, while Sweden and Poland support continued fighting until all Ukrainian territory is reclaimed. Conversely, Italy, Greece, and Bulgaria view increased arms supplies to Ukraine unfavorably. Italy is notably the least supportive major European nation, and there is a lack of national consensus in countries like the Czech Republic, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has struggled to convince the French public to adopt a stronger pro-Ukraine stance, with opinions divided on supporting Ukraine's territorial recovery, pushing for peace talks, or remaining neutral. The poll's authors highlight the stability of public opinion despite the escalating conflict, noting the challenge for Western leaders in reconciling differing views on ending the war.",

Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov emphasized the importance of the SCO and BRICS in establishing a new world order and promoting true multilateralism. Despite their declared \"no limits\" partnership, China and Russia have long competed for influence in Central Asia, a region crucial for China's Belt and Road Initiative due to its rich natural resources and strategic location for land transport between China and Europe. The summit also saw participation from Central Asian countries, India, Iran, and Pakistan, with Belarus expected to join as a new member.

        "summary": "In June, the U.S. government announced a $360 million arms sale to Taiwan, including two attack drone missile systems. This sparked controversy in Taiwan, with some commentators claiming the drones were overpriced and ineffective. These claims were widely circulated in Taiwanese and Chinese media.\n\nThe Asia Fact Check Lab (AFCL) investigated these claims by consulting U.S. State Department sources, military experts, and public records. They found that the commentators lacked evidence and spread misleading information. For instance, contrary to claims that no other countries wanted the \"Switchblade 300\" drones, France and another U.S. ally had purchased them.\n\nExperts like Richard Fisher and Tony Hu argued that these drones are suitable for Taiwan's defense needs, especially against potential Chinese military actions. The Taiwan Ministry of National Defense also defended the purchase, stating the drones are crucial for asymmetric warfare.\n\nThe AFCL found discrepancies in the reported costs of the drones, noting that the actual unit cost is higher than some commentators claimed. They emphasized that the total cost includes training and maintenance, not just the drones themselves.\n\nThis incident is part of a broader pattern of skepticism towards U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, often fueled by misinformation. Despite the controversy, Taiwan's government welcomed the arms sale, while China opposed it, citing violations of the One-China principle.",

        "summary": "NATO is preparing a \"Plan B\" to ensure continued support for Ukraine amid the increasing possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House. Trump's team is considering a strategy to reposition NATO, making Europe the dominant force while the U.S. takes a secondary role. This plan includes a two-tier NATO system where countries not meeting the 2% GDP defense spending target would not receive U.S. defense guarantees. NATO is also planning new measures, such as establishing a new military command in Wiesbaden, Germany, to coordinate military aid and training for Ukraine. Additionally, NATO is discussing the deployment of more nuclear weapons in response to threats from Moscow and Beijing.",

        "summary": "NATO is preparing a \"Plan B\" to ensure continued support for Ukraine amid the increasing possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House. Trump's team is considering a strategy to reposition NATO, making Europe the dominant force while the U.S. takes a secondary role. This plan includes demanding European NATO members significantly increase their defense spending and potentially creating a two-tier NATO system where only countries meeting the 2% GDP defense budget target receive U.S. security guarantees.\n\nNATO's new measures, to be announced at a summit in Washington, D.C., include appointing a senior civilian official to Kyiv and establishing a new military command in Wiesbaden, Germany, to coordinate military aid and training for Ukraine. This comes as NATO faces internal debates over defense spending and the potential impact of Trump's policies on the alliance's support for Ukraine.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has emphasized the importance of increased defense spending among European and Canadian allies, noting significant budget increases since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Additionally, NATO is discussing the deployment of more nuclear weapons in response to threats from Moscow and Beijing, maintaining its stance as a nuclear alliance for deterrence and security.",

        "summary": "On July 3, 2024, significant developments occurred in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n visited Kyiv on July 2, proposing to deepen bilateral relations, assist in Ukraine's modernization, and provide humanitarian aid. Orb\u00e1n expressed support for Ukrainian President Zelensky's peace initiatives but suggested a ceasefire before negotiations. His visit aimed to balance interests between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nUkrainian forces launched several attacks, including a missile strike on a Russian Black Sea Fleet logistics center in Sevastopol, Crimea, and an assault on a Russian airbase in Kursk. Ukrainian drones also targeted Russian defenses in Novorossiysk port. Ukrainian forces made gains in various regions, including Kharkiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, while Russian forces faced significant losses.\n\nUkraine announced the imminent arrival of the first batch of F-16 fighter jets, expected to enhance its defense capabilities. The U.S. pledged an additional $2.3 billion in military aid, including air defense systems and anti-tank weapons. NATO plans to propose a \"New Sweden\" model for Ukraine, offering close security cooperation without formal membership, and to establish a new command center in Wiesbaden, Germany, to coordinate military support.\n\nDespite ongoing conflict, Ukraine remains determined to resist and achieve victory, with continued support from Western allies.",

        "summary": "On July 3, Politico reported that if Donald Trump is re-elected, his new NATO plan includes a proposal to end the Russia-Ukraine war by having Ukraine cede territory. Trump is reportedly negotiating with Russian President Vladimir Putin on how much Ukrainian land Russia can retain. Two national security experts connected to Trump indicated that the plan involves NATO not expanding eastward, particularly not into Ukraine and Georgia. Trump aims to significantly increase European contributions to NATO and make substantial adjustments to the alliance. Although U.S. law prevents a president from unilaterally withdrawing from NATO, Trump plans to reform it. His advisors suggest that Trump would reduce aid to Ukraine to force peace talks, leading to territorial concessions. Russia is betting on Trump's return to the White House, especially as President Biden faces health issues. Meanwhile, Europe and NATO are developing new mechanisms to continue supporting Ukraine, anticipating potential disruptions from Trump's possible re-election and the rise of right-wing parties in Europe.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the recent escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, highlighting a specific incident where Ukrainian forces used American-supplied missiles to attack Russian civilians, resulting in significant casualties, including children. This event has caused a major shock in Russia. The article suggests that the U.S. is using a \"salami-slicing\" tactic, where it tests the limits of its adversaries by allowing its allies to cross red lines, then quickly seeks to de-escalate tensions through diplomatic communication. This tactic aims to force adversaries into compromises while maintaining plausible deniability. The article also compares this strategy to U.S. actions in the Middle East and towards China, noting that China has responded with strong countermeasures, unlike Russia, which the article claims is more cautious due to its own limitations. The article concludes that the U.S. appears to back down only superficially and that true deterrence against such tactics requires absolute strength.",

        "summary": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visited a military factory following the conclusion of the 10th plenary meeting of the 8th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, as reported by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). During his visit, Kim emphasized the need to modernize production processes across all economic sectors. He inspected unmanned production lines and integrated production management systems, urging the sharing of these advancements with other industries. The plenary meeting, which reviewed the first half of the year's work, was held from June 28 for four days. Kim praised the economic improvements and aimed to extend military production modernization to other sectors. Analysts suggest North Korea is accelerating its military industry development not only to bolster defense but also to capitalize on opportunities arising from the Russia-Ukraine war. Kim has made several visits to military factories this year, including in May.",

        "summary": "The article discusses China's strategic opportunity to expand its land power westward, particularly through Central Asia, due to recent geopolitical shifts. Historically, China's land power expansion has been hindered by Russia's control over Central Asia and the U.S. presence in Afghanistan. However, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and Russia's preoccupation with the Ukraine war have created a power vacuum in Central Asia. This has allowed China to advance projects like the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway, which had been stalled for 27 years. The article highlights China's recent visit to Kazakhstan as a sign of deepening cooperation in the region. The author warns of potential risks, such as Russia's strategic maneuvers and the possibility of escalating tensions in the Korean Peninsula, which could complicate China's plans. Overall, the article suggests that China stands to gain significantly if it can navigate these challenges and maintain strategic stability.",

        "summary": "The news article discusses the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine, highlighting several key points:\n\n1. **Rising Ammunition Costs**: The price of 155mm artillery shells has surged from $1,500 to $8,000 per shell due to the war, creating lucrative opportunities for countries like Pakistan.\n\n2. **Pakistan's Role**: Pakistan, facing significant debt and economic challenges, is reportedly selling artillery shells to Ukraine. These shells were originally imported from China in 2020.\n\n3. **U.S. Involvement**: The U.S. is indirectly funding Pakistan's ammunition sales to Ukraine through the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n4. **Third-Party Transactions**: Both Ukraine and Russia are using third-party countries to circumvent direct sanctions and embargoes, with Ukraine receiving drones and other military supplies through such channels.\n\n5. **Russian Military Production**: Russia is ramping up its military production, aiming to significantly increase the output of artillery shells, rockets, drones, and armored vehicles by 2024.\n\n6. **Western Sanctions**: Sanctions have increased the cost of key electronic components for Russian military equipment by 30%.\n\n7. **Russian Strategy**: Russia is intensifying its military pressure on Ukraine, aiming to deplete Ukrainian resources and force a favorable ceasefire agreement.\n\nThe article underscores the complex international dynamics and economic implications of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.",

        "summary": "A widely circulated claim on social media suggests that five regions in Russia held an online referendum to secede from the country, potentially indicating a \"second disintegration\" of Russia. This claim refers to an online vote initiated in February 2023 by the anti-Russian organization Free Nations of PostRussia Forum (FNRF), which advocates for the dissolution of Russia. The vote, which lacks legal validity, was conducted without any official oversight, and its results were published solely by the organizing committee, raising questions about their authenticity. The Russian government has labeled FNRF as an \"undesirable organization\" due to its perceived threat to national security and constitutional order. The voting website has been restricted by Russian authorities.",

        "summary": "The news article addresses claims circulating on social media about five regions in Russia holding an online referendum to secede from the country. This purported referendum, which took place in February 2023, was organized by the anti-Russian group Free Nations of PostRussia Forum (FNRF). The FNRF, deemed an \"undesirable organization\" by the Russian Prosecutor General's Office for threatening constitutional order and security, lacks legal authority. The results of this online vote, which showed significant support for independence in regions like Kaliningrad and Siberia, were released solely by the FNRF without any verification from independent bodies. Consequently, the authenticity of the data is questionable. The Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology, and Mass Media has since restricted access to the voting website.",

        "summary": "A widely circulated claim on social media suggests that five regions in Russia held an online referendum to secede from the country. This claim refers to an online vote initiated in February 2023 by the anti-Russian organization Free Nations of PostRussia Forum (FNRF), which advocates for the dissolution of Russia. The vote, which lacks legal validity, was conducted without any official oversight, and its results were published solely by the organizing committee, raising questions about their authenticity. The Russian government has labeled FNRF as an \"undesirable organization\" due to its perceived threat to national security and constitutional order. The website hosting the vote has been restricted by Russian authorities.",

        "summary": "The U.S. Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program is facing significant uncertainty due to budget constraints and evolving technological considerations. Key points include:\n\n1. **Budget Constraints**: U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff David Alvin and Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall have indicated that financial limitations are forcing a reassessment of the NGAD program. The high costs of developing and purchasing the next-generation fighter, estimated at around $300 million per unit, are a major concern.\n\n2. **Technological Shifts**: The emergence of new technologies, such as drones, and lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war are prompting the Air Force to reconsider its strategy. There is a growing preference for rapidly evolving autonomous drones over long-serving manned aircraft.\n\n3. **Industry Impact**: Companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which have heavily invested in competing for the NGAD contract, face potential setbacks if the program is canceled. This uncertainty also affects suppliers preparing for the next-generation air dominance systems.\n\n4. **Strategic Re-evaluation**: The Air Force is contemplating a shift away from traditional, expensive, and complex aircraft towards a mix of B-21 bombers, drones, and standoff weapons. This reflects a broader change in military strategy and operational concepts.\n\n5. **Uncertain Future**: No final decisions have been made, but the Air Force's leadership is considering difficult choices. The potential cancellation of NGAD could lead to extended use of existing platforms like the F-35.\n\nIn summary, the NGAD program's future is uncertain due to budgetary pressures, technological advancements, and strategic shifts, impacting both the military and defense industry stakeholders.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the recent television debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, highlighting Biden's perceived frailty and Trump's stronger performance. A significant portion of the audience favored Trump, with post-debate polls showing an increase in his support. The White House has denied claims that Biden has dementia, despite his age-related challenges.\n\nThe article notes that Biden's presidency has had successes, such as handling the COVID-19 pandemic and uniting allies, but also faced issues like inflation and international conflicts. It suggests that Biden's age (82) is a significant obstacle for his re-election chances, with some media speculating about his potential withdrawal from the race.\n\nTrump's potential return to the presidency is discussed, with expectations of continued tough policies on trade and technology, particularly against China. The article also speculates on Trump's ability to end the Russia-Ukraine war through strategic negotiations.\n\nThe economic implications of a Trump presidency are considered, with predictions of slowed economic growth and accelerated inflation. The article concludes by reflecting on the broader geopolitical shifts and the increasing polarization of global economic policies.",

        "summary": "In February 2023, an online vote was initiated by the anti-Russian organization Free Nations of PostRussia Forum (FNRF), advocating for the dissolution of Russia. This vote, which lacks legal validity, was aimed at determining whether five Russian regions should secede. The results, released solely by the organizing committee without any verification, indicated a majority support for independence in these regions. However, the authenticity of the data is questionable, and the voting website has been restricted by Russian authorities. The FNRF has been labeled an \"undesirable organization\" by the Russian Prosecutor General's Office, citing threats to constitutional order and security. The online vote and its results have been widely circulated on social media, but they have not been officially recognized or reported by major Russian media outlets.",

        "summary": "Finnish President Alexander Stubb stated that Russia's dependence on China has reached a point where a single phone call from Chinese President Xi Jinping could end the Russia-Ukraine war. Stubb's comments reflect growing frustration among Ukraine's allies over China's perceived support for Russia, including providing military technology and helping Moscow circumvent international trade restrictions. He emphasized that if Xi called for peace negotiations, Russia would have no choice but to comply.\n\nChina has positioned itself as a neutral party in the conflict, criticizing Russia's attacks on civilians and threats of nuclear weapon use, while opposing international sanctions not backed by the UN. Trade data shows China's share of Russia's trade increased to 28% in 2022, while the EU's share dropped to 17%.\n\nStubb argued that ending the war would benefit China by upholding international rules related to territorial integrity and sovereignty. Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to discuss the issue further at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan.",

        "summary": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump, who is actively participating in the 2024 presidential election, has repeatedly claimed that he could resolve the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours if re-elected. During the first debate of the election on June 27, Trump reiterated this claim, stating he could solve the conflict even before his potential inauguration. However, Russian officials, including Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, have dismissed Trump's assertions as unrealistic and lacking substantive details. Peskov emphasized that any peace plan proposed by a future Trump administration must reflect the current situation in Ukraine. Nebenzia criticized Western support for Ukraine and dismissed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's peace proposals as impractical. The ongoing conflict, which began in February 2022, remains unresolved, with significant geopolitical implications.",

        "summary": "European officials have reported that Chinese and Russian companies are collaborating to develop and test an attack drone similar to the Iranian Shahed drones used in Ukraine, indicating potential lethal military aid from Beijing to Moscow. The project began last year and has now reached the development and testing phase, with plans to ship the drones to Russia. These drones have not yet been deployed in Ukraine.\n\nSince the Russia-Ukraine war began, Russia has used thousands of Iranian Shahed drones and even built a factory for their mass production. Russia continues to rely on supplies from countries like North Korea and Iran, and on China for key components. European officials are concerned that China could produce these drones faster than Iran or Russia.\n\nThe specific drone being developed by Chinese and Russian companies has not been disclosed, but reports suggest it may be similar to the Chinese \"Sunflower-200\" suicide drone, which resembles the Iranian Shahed-136.\n\nDespite warnings from the U.S. and other Western nations against providing lethal weapons to Russia, this collaboration suggests deepening support from Beijing to Moscow. Some countries view supplying attack drones as crossing a line into providing lethal aid.\n\nThe U.S. assesses that China is considering sending fully assembled drones to Russia but is currently shipping parts that can be converted into attack drones. The U.S. has not concluded that China is providing lethal aid, though other countries might interpret the situation differently.\n\nChina has also been reported to supply Russia with satellite imagery, microelectronics, and other materials that can be used for military purposes. The Chinese embassy in the U.S. denies providing weapons to any party in the Ukraine conflict and emphasizes China's call for dialogue and peace.\n\nU.S. NATO Ambassador Julianne Smith stated that China claims neutrality in the Ukraine war but has provided dual-use components that enable Russia's aggression. NATO aims to expose China's support for Russia and warn of the risks involved.",

        "summary": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspected an arms factory following the conclusion of the 10th Plenary Meeting of the 8th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. During his visit, he emphasized the need to promote the modernization of production processes across all economic sectors. Kim reviewed the factory's unmanned production lines and integrated production management system, urging the enhancement of production command informatization and the sharing of these advancements with other economic fields. He also visited a machinery plant and a medical equipment factory.\n\nThe plenary meeting, which Kim chaired, began on June 28 and lasted four days, summarizing the first half of the year's work. Kim positively assessed the economic situation, noting an upward trend. Analysts suggest that Kim's immediate visit to the arms factory aimed to encourage party officials to extend military production modernization achievements to other sectors.\n\nNorth Korea has been accelerating its military industry development, with experts suggesting this move aims to bolster defense capabilities and potentially capitalize on opportunities arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Kim had previously inspected military enterprises multiple times in May.",

        "summary": "The news article addresses claims circulating on social media about an online referendum held in five Russian regions regarding their independence from Russia. This referendum, initiated in February 2023 by the anti-Russian organization Free Nations of PostRussia Forum (FNRF), lacks legal validity and official recognition. The FNRF, deemed an \"undesirable organization\" by the Russian Prosecutor General's Office for threatening constitutional order and security, conducted the vote without any certified oversight, casting doubt on the authenticity of the results. The Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology, and Mass Media has since restricted access to the voting website. The article clarifies that the purported referendum results, which suggest significant support for independence in these regions, are not credible and have been disseminated solely by the FNRF.",

        "summary": "In June, the U.S. government announced a $360 million arms sale to Taiwan, including two attack drone missile systems. This sparked controversy in Taiwan, with some commentators claiming the drones are overpriced and ineffective. These claims were widely circulated by media in both Taiwan and China.\n\nThe Asia Fact Check Lab (AFCL) investigated these claims by consulting U.S. State Department sources, military experts, and official documents. They found that the criticisms lacked evidence and were misleading. For instance, contrary to claims that no other countries wanted the \"Switchblade 300\" drones, France and another U.S. ally had purchased them.\n\nExperts like Richard Fisher and Tony Hu argued that these drones are suitable for Taiwan's defense needs, especially against potential Chinese military actions. The Taiwan Ministry of National Defense also defended the purchase, stating the drones are crucial for modern asymmetric warfare.\n\nThe AFCL noted that the cost of the drones includes additional components and services, making direct price comparisons misleading. This incident is part of a broader pattern of skepticism towards U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, often fueled by misinformation. The AFCL emphasized the importance of verifying such claims to avoid the spread of false information.",

        "summary": "The news article discusses the severe corruption within the Chinese military, as highlighted by former officer Jiang Lin, now residing in Canada. Two former Chinese Defense Ministers, Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe, have been expelled from the Communist Party due to corruption charges, which have been handed over to military prosecutors. Jiang Lin asserts that the Chinese military is deeply corrupt and lacks combat effectiveness. The article also touches on the large-scale purge within China's defense institutions since last summer, resulting in the removal of over a dozen senior military officials and defense industry executives. Despite President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, the military continues to struggle with corruption due to the lack of civilian oversight and an independent judiciary. The article further explores the implications of this corruption on China's military capabilities and Xi's ambitions regarding Taiwan.",

        "summary": "The news article discusses the severe corruption within the Chinese military, as highlighted by former officer Jiang Lin, now residing in Canada. Two former Chinese Defense Ministers, Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe, have been expelled from the Communist Party due to corruption charges, which have been handed over to military prosecutors. This is part of a broader purge within China's defense institutions since last summer, resulting in the removal of over a dozen senior military officials and defense industry executives.\n\nJiang Lin, a former journalist for the PLA Daily, asserts that the Chinese military is deeply corrupt and lacks combat effectiveness. Despite President Xi Jinping's efforts to strengthen the military and assert China's territorial claims, the top echelons of the PLA are in turmoil. Analysts suggest that the ongoing corruption, despite Xi's anti-corruption campaign, underscores the difficulty of eradicating corruption without proper civilian oversight and an independent judiciary.\n\nThe article also touches on the implications of this corruption for China's military ambitions, particularly regarding Taiwan. Jiang Lin predicts that Xi might hesitate to use force against Taiwan due to the military's compromised state. The article concludes with a discussion on the broader societal impact of corruption and the erosion of trust in the Chinese government and military.",

        "summary": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not attend the 24th Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, on July 3. Instead, Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar will represent India. Modi is preparing for visits to Russia on July 8-9 for a bilateral summit with President Vladimir Putin, and to Austria for a two-day visit starting July 9. \n\nThe SCO Summit will focus on regional security, member connectivity, and trade, discussing issues like the Afghanistan situation and the Ukraine war. Modi's absence, attributed to scheduling conflicts and domestic parliamentary duties, may impact the summit and the SCO's future activities. Analysts suggest India's strategic balancing act between China-Russia and the West is a key reason for Modi's decision. \n\nThe SCO, founded in 1996, includes nine member countries, with Belarus expected to join as the 10th member. Modi's absence is notable as Indian Prime Ministers usually attend these summits.",

        "summary": "On July 1, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke at a foreign policy forum in Washington, hosted by the Brookings Institution. Blinken mentioned China over 30 times, asserting that China aims to dominate the international system with a vision different from other countries. He argued that the U.S. must engage in \"fierce competition\" with China to ensure it is the U.S. that shapes the future.\n\nBlinken also linked China's support for Russia to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, suggesting that China's actions enable Russia to sustain its defense industry and high-intensity conflict. This stance was criticized as hypocritical, given the U.S.'s role in NATO expansion, which has been seen as a factor in the war.\n\nThe article questions whether the U.S. can truly represent global interests, noting that the Western bloc led by the U.S. comprises only 22 countries, and even within this group, there are disagreements, such as between the U.S. and France. It argues that the U.S. has historically pursued its own interests at the expense of global stability, citing its influence in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East, and its role in various conflicts and economic policies.\n\nThe article concludes that Blinken's claim that the U.S. represents global interests is a fallacy, as the U.S. has often acted in ways that benefit itself rather than the global community.",

        "summary": "Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia inherited a significant portion of its military-industrial complex but has struggled to maintain and advance it due to economic challenges and export controls from the US and Europe. To overcome these obstacles, Russia has increasingly turned to China for advanced equipment and technology. \n\nKey points:\n1. **Historical Context**: Russia inherited a substantial but incomplete military-industrial system from the Soviet Union, which has deteriorated over time due to economic difficulties and lack of investment.\n2. **Current Challenges**: The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has highlighted deficiencies in Russia's military capabilities, including outdated equipment and insufficient production capacity.\n3. **Export Controls**: US and European export controls have severely restricted Russia's ability to import high-tech equipment, particularly CNC machines, which are crucial for modern military production.\n4. **China's Role**: In response, Russia has significantly increased its imports of Chinese advanced equipment. Chinese products are replacing those from \"unfriendly countries,\" with around 70% of Russian enterprises now opting for Chinese-made equipment.\n5. **Economic Data**: Trade between China and Russia has surged, with a notable increase in the export of machinery and high-tech products from China to Russia. For instance, the trade in CNC machines between the two countries has increased tenfold since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began.\n6. **Mutual Benefits**: This deepening cooperation is mutually beneficial. Russia gains access to essential technology and equipment, while China secures a significant market for its products, especially in the face of Western sanctions.\n\nThe collaboration between Russia and China is expected to continue growing, providing both nations with new opportunities and reinforcing their economic and strategic partnership.",

        "summary": "The latest economic data from the European Union indicates that inflation in the Eurozone slightly decreased in June. However, experts believe this reduction is insufficient to persuade the European Central Bank (ECB) to accelerate its rate-cutting cycle, despite sluggish economic growth.\n\nKey points include:\n- The Eurozone's consumer price index (CPI) annual growth rate for June was 2.5%, down from 2.6% in May, aligning with forecasts by FactSet and Bloomberg economists.\n- Core inflation, excluding volatile items like energy and food, remained steady at 2.9%, higher than the expected 2.8%.\n- Inflation had peaked at 10.6% in June 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine war, prompting unprecedented rate hikes by the ECB.\n- The ECB announced its first rate cut since 2019 on June 6, but officials are cautious about further cuts in the upcoming July meeting.\n- ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasized the need for continued vigilance, stating, \"Our task is not yet complete.\"\n\nThe data suggests a cautious approach by the ECB towards future rate cuts, reflecting ongoing economic uncertainties.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the escalating tensions between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, particularly around the Ren'ai Shoal. Key points include:\n\n1. **Recent Clashes**: On June 17, Chinese and Philippine vessels collided, with both sides blaming each other for the incident.\n2. **Statements from Officials**: Philippine military chief Romeo Brawner emphasized the need for preparedness but denied that recent military actions were aimed at China. President Marcos has instructed efforts to avoid war while maintaining sovereignty in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\n3. **Expert Opinions**: Analysts believe that while tensions are high, the likelihood of full-scale war is low due to the economic interests of both nations. Experts suggest that both countries will likely seek negotiations and diplomatic solutions.\n4. **International Involvement**: The U.S. has reiterated its support for the Philippines, with high-level discussions between U.S. and Philippine officials emphasizing the importance of the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty.\n5. **Strategic Measures**: The Philippines is enhancing its military capabilities and diversifying its economic partnerships to reduce dependence on China. The country is also strengthening ties with other nations like Japan, Australia, and the EU for security cooperation.\n\nOverall, the situation remains tense but controlled, with both nations and their allies focusing on diplomatic and strategic measures to manage the conflict.",

        "summary": "A German professor at Jilin University, Bj\u00f6rn Alexander D\u00fcben, was expelled from China after commenting on President Xi Jinping's European visit and China's support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine during an interview with Voice of America. D\u00fcben, who had a high-level foreign talent visa valid until 2033, was forced to resign and leave China within two weeks. His lectures and courses were canceled, and he was given the option to resign or face disciplinary action. D\u00fcben believes his comments on Xi's visit, which aimed to divide US-EU relations and probe EU internal fractures, led to his expulsion. This incident highlights the increasing control of Chinese universities by the Communist Party and serves as a warning to foreign scholars about the risks of criticizing Chinese policies.",

        "summary": "The news article discusses the evolving dynamics of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its broader geopolitical implications. Key points include:\n\n1. **Zelensky's Shift in Stance**: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who previously refused to negotiate with Russia as long as Vladimir Putin remained in power, has now expressed willingness to engage in talks through third-party mediation. This change is attributed to Russia's military gains in Eastern Ukraine and significant Ukrainian casualties.\n\n2. **NATO's Reaction**: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg accused China of inciting the Russia-Ukraine conflict and supporting Russia's ongoing military efforts. This accusation, made without evidence, suggests NATO's strategic focus may be shifting towards countering China.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Implications**: The article suggests that NATO has long considered strategies to confront both Russia and China. Stoltenberg's comments indicate a potential alliance between NATO and Asia-Pacific countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand to counter China.\n\n4. **China's Response**: The article emphasizes the need for China to prepare for potential military conflicts with NATO and to support Russia to prevent NATO from concentrating its efforts solely on China.\n\nThe article underscores the interconnectedness of global conflicts and the strategic calculations of major powers like the US, NATO, Russia, and China.",

        "summary": "Kyiv is seeking to increase GDP-linked bonds to avoid a debt default amid the restructuring of approximately $20 billion in international debt. Despite failing to reach an agreement with bondholders during formal negotiations, Ukrainian authorities remain optimistic about achieving their debt restructuring goals by August 1. Key figures involved include Yuriy Butsa, head of Ukraine's Debt Management Office, and Gavin Gray, IMF's representative in Ukraine. The restructuring plan includes converting existing international bonds into new sovereign bonds maturing between 2034 and 2040, and introducing state-contingent debt instruments. The IMF's debt sustainability analysis has highlighted the importance of addressing GDP-linked bonds, which amount to $2.6 billion. The Ukrainian government has proposed measures to ensure these bonds do not trigger default events, but bondholders have countered with proposals that do not meet IMF requirements. The outcome of these negotiations is crucial for Ukraine's financial stability amid the ongoing conflict with Russia.",

        "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who was visiting Ukraine as Hungary began its six-month term as the EU's rotating presidency. This visit marked Orb\u00e1n's first trip to Kyiv since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war on February 24, 2022. During their meeting, both leaders held a joint press conference where Orb\u00e1n expressed Hungary's desire to establish bilateral global cooperation with Ukraine and to resolve past differences. They discussed various issues including trade, cross-border cooperation, infrastructure, energy, and humanitarian concerns. Notably, Orb\u00e1n had previously vetoed a \u20ac50 billion EU aid package for Ukraine in December 2023 but later withdrew the veto.",

        "summary": "The Chinese media recently released an illustration of the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) new \"Xia Pao\" artillery, a 300mm caliber howitzer capable of firing across the Taiwan Strait into Taiwan. The PLA claims this artillery has a maximum range of 400 kilometers and can destroy dense structures, influenced by the Russia-Ukraine war and potential future unification actions. Developed by China North Industries Group, the \"Xia Pao\" is a vehicle-mounted howitzer with a 15-meter barrel. This development reflects China's advanced capabilities in large-caliber artillery and provides new tactical options for military operations.",

        "summary": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n visited Kyiv to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a day after Hungary assumed the EU Council presidency. The main topics were Ukraine's resistance against Russia and peace opportunities, as well as bilateral relations. Orb\u00e1n's visit is notable given his close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his opposition to EU aid and sanctions against Russia, which has frustrated Zelensky and other EU leaders. Despite Hungary's EU presidency, Orb\u00e1n has been critical of EU policies and skeptical about Ukraine's EU membership. The visit follows months of diplomatic preparation and occurs amid historically tense Hungary-Ukraine relations, partly due to Ukraine's language laws affecting Hungarian minorities. The outcome of the visit on bilateral relations remains to be seen.",

        "summary": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to consider a ceasefire to expedite the end of the war with Russia. Following their meeting on July 2, Orb\u00e1n emphasized the importance of Ukraine's peace efforts at the May summit in Switzerland and the upcoming second summit later this year. He discussed the potential for a ceasefire with Zelensky and appreciated Zelensky's honest responses. Zelensky mentioned that their dialogue could form the basis for bilateral cooperation. Orb\u00e1n welcomed Zelensky's comments and expressed Hungary's willingness to help modernize Ukraine's economy. This meeting is notable as Hungary has often opposed EU support for Ukraine and sought to limit sanctions against Russia, leading to tense relations between Hungary and Ukraine. Hungary recently assumed the EU's rotating presidency, and Orb\u00e1n's visit to Kyiv was aimed at addressing EU challenges.",

        "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is formulating a comprehensive plan to end the ongoing war with Russia, based on Kyiv's stance. During a joint press conference with visiting Slovenian President Natasa Pirc Musar, Zelenskyy emphasized the importance of presenting a peace plan supported by the majority of the world's nations. Currently, there are no negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, with significant differences in their conditions for ending the war. Ukraine demands a complete Russian withdrawal from its internationally recognized territories, including Crimea, while Russia insists on Ukraine ceding four eastern and southern regions.\n\nRecently, over 90 leaders and officials attended the first Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland, where Zelenskyy sought support for Ukraine's negotiation position. Meanwhile, Russian forces have exploited delays in Western military aid to Ukraine, launching large-scale attacks near Kharkiv, though their momentum has waned. Outgoing NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noted that Russian offensives have achieved minimal success and sees no signs of a significant Russian breakthrough.\n\nAdditionally, a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian village near the border killed five people, including two children, and injured two others. Both sides frequently use drones for attacks, with Ukraine intensifying strikes on Russian targets. In another incident, a Russian missile hit a nine-story apartment building in Dnipro, Ukraine, killing at least one person and injuring 12.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the delicate balancing act of Chinese President Xi Jinping amid pressures from both the West and Russia. The U.S. and NATO have warned China against providing military support to Russia, threatening economic consequences if China continues its support. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg have accused China of aiding Russia's defense industry, which helps sustain its war efforts against Ukraine.\n\nChina, on the other hand, maintains that its trade with Russia is normal and not intended to fuel the conflict. However, internal and external pressures are mounting. Notably, Poland's President Andrzej Duda has urged Xi to reconsider support for Russia, highlighting the war's impact on Europe.\n\nThe article also mentions the defection of former Russian Deputy Defense Minister Tatyana Shevtsova to France, which could provide the West with insights into China's contributions to Russia's military capabilities.\n\nChina's economic ties with Russia have fluctuated, partly due to fears of secondary sanctions from the U.S. and NATO. Despite a temporary decline in trade, recent meetings between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin have led to a resurgence in trade activities, facilitated by smaller Chinese banks to avoid sanctions.\n\nThe West, particularly the U.S. and NATO, is considering expanding sanctions and rallying other countries, like Japan, to impose economic measures against China. Japan has already sanctioned Chinese entities aiding Russia, marking a significant move.\n\nThe article concludes by noting the strategic pressures on Xi from both the West and Russia, with the West offering potential economic incentives to sway China away from supporting Russia. The outcome of these geopolitical maneuvers could significantly impact the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.",

        "summary": "In a recent development in the Russia-Ukraine war, Ukrainian forces launched a night assault on Russian positions near Vovchansk, leading to significant Russian casualties and a mutiny among Chechen units and the 153rd Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment. The mutiny was driven by severe war fatigue and heavy losses among Russian troops. Additionally, Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian female prisoner assault unit and captured female prisoners for the first time.\n\nIn a separate but related event, former Russian Deputy Defense Minister Tatyana Shevtsova defected to the West, taking with her highly classified intelligence sought by NATO. This defection has caused significant turmoil within the Russian government, with President Putin reportedly furious and the new Defense Minister, Belousov, condemning Shevtsova as a traitor. The defection is expected to have severe implications for Russian military operations and intelligence security.",

It attributes this shift to factors such as globalization, market liberalism, and the advent of mobile internet, which decentralized information production from professional media to the general public. This shift has led to a proliferation of low-quality, extreme content driven by algorithms on internet platforms, prioritizing sensationalism and \"hate traffic\" for commercial gain.\n\nThe article emphasizes the dangers of \"hate traffic,\" which includes spreading rumors, vulgar content, anxiety-inducing information, and hate speech. It warns that such content can lead to societal division, violence, and the erosion of rational discourse. The author calls for internet platforms to take responsibility and actively resist promoting hate-driven content. Recent actions by platforms like NetEase and Tencent to penalize content that incites extreme nationalism are seen as positive steps, but the author argues that more comprehensive measures are needed across all platforms, especially video platforms.\n\nThe article concludes by urging large internet companies to adopt more responsible business models, akin to those of international tech giants like Google and Microsoft, focusing on solving real human problems and fostering technological innovation rather than merely chasing traffic. Failure to do so, the author warns, could result in these companies being undermined by the very extremism they help propagate.",

This visit, Modi's first bilateral trip since winning his third term, breaks the tradition of visiting neighboring countries like Bhutan, Maldives, and Sri Lanka first. The visit underscores India's emphasis on its relationship with Russia, a key supplier of military hardware and a major source of crude oil for India. Discussions are expected to cover military logistics cooperation, the joint development of fifth-generation fighter jets, and nuclear energy collaboration, though no major agreements are anticipated.",

        "summary": "The article reports on recent developments in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Key points include:\n\n1. **Russian Attack on Ukrainian Air Base**: Anticipating the arrival of the first batch of F-16 fighter jets from Western countries to Ukraine, Russia attacked a Ukrainian air base in Starokostiantyniv, Khmelnytskyi region. This base has been a frequent target since the war began in February 2022.\n\n2. **F-16 Deployment Challenges**: Ukraine faces challenges in deploying these F-16 jets due to ongoing Russian attacks. Despite these attacks, Ukrainian officials assert that the delivery and operational deployment of the F-16s will proceed.\n\n3. **ATACMS Missile Study**: Russia is studying the U.S.-made ATACMS long-range missiles after recovering a guidance system from a downed missile. This study aims to improve Russia's ability to intercept these missiles.\n\n4. **Impact of U.S. Presidential Election**: The outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election is significant for Russia, as it will influence the level of U.S. support for Ukraine. Former President Donald Trump claims he could end the war quickly if re-elected.\n\n5. **Peace Negotiations**: Russia remains open to peace talks but emphasizes the need to consider the realities on the ground in Eastern Ukraine. Recent peace proposals by President Putin have not been accepted by the West or Ukraine.\n\nThese developments highlight the ongoing strategic maneuvers and geopolitical implications of the conflict.",

        "summary": "The news article reports on recent military developments involving Ukraine and Russia. Key points include:\n\n1. **Russian Attack on Ukrainian Air Base**: Russia attacked a Ukrainian air base in Khmelnytskyi, targeting facilities potentially housing incoming F-16 fighter jets provided by Western countries. This attack is part of Russia's efforts to prevent the deployment of these jets.\n\n2. **Ukraine's Use of ATACMS Missiles**: Ukraine used MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to strike the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, causing casualties. In response, Russia is studying the technology of these American-made long-range missiles to improve its defense capabilities.\n\n3. **Impact on F-16 Deployment**: Despite the attacks, Ukrainian officials assert that the delivery and deployment of F-16 jets will proceed. However, military analysts suggest that the attacks on air base infrastructure could complicate the operational use of these jets.\n\n4. **Russian Analysis of ATACMS**: Russian forces have reportedly obtained and are analyzing the guidance system of an ATACMS missile to identify vulnerabilities and enhance their interception capabilities.\n\n5. **Political Context**: The article also touches on the broader political implications, including statements from former U.S. President Donald Trump about ending the war if re-elected, and comments from Russian officials on the improbability of a quick resolution to the conflict.\n\nThese developments highlight the ongoing strategic and technological maneuvers in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with significant implications for military operations and international political dynamics.",

        "summary": "On July 2, 2024, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban arrived in Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. This visit marks Orban's first trip to Ukraine since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war. The primary agenda of their talks is to explore opportunities for peace between Russia and Ukraine and to discuss bilateral relations. Orban's visit coincides with Hungary's first day as the rotating president of the EU Council, a role that allows Hungary to influence the EU's agenda and priorities. Orban has previously criticized Western military aid to Ukraine, arguing it exacerbates the conflict. He advocates for peace negotiations and a ceasefire to end the war. Hungary has historically opposed EU intervention in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and has maintained relations with Moscow.",

        "summary": "NATO is set to deploy a senior civilian official to Kyiv and establish a new command center in Wiesbaden, Germany, to coordinate military aid and training for Ukraine. This move aims to ensure continued support for Ukraine, even if former President Trump, who has criticized U.S. spending on Ukraine, returns to power. The new measures, to be announced at an upcoming summit in Washington, are designed to support Ukraine's eventual NATO membership without granting immediate membership. The initiative will involve nearly 700 personnel from 32 NATO countries and aims to institutionalize NATO's role in aiding Ukraine, making it less susceptible to political changes in member countries. The U.S. will continue to play a significant role, but the new structure will allow NATO to manage aid and training more independently. The summit will also discuss financial commitments for military support to Ukraine, with a target of around $40 billion annually.",

        "summary": "On July 2, 2024, significant developments occurred in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Ukrainian forces launched missile attacks on Crimea's Sevastopol, reportedly hitting a Russian logistics base despite Russian claims of intercepting all missiles. Additionally, Ukrainian forces targeted Belgorod, Kursk, and Voronezh, causing widespread power outages.\n\nRussian forces retaliated by attacking Ukraine's Myrhorod airbase, destroying a Su-27 aircraft. Ukrainian officials downplayed the damage, suggesting the targeted aircraft were non-operational.\n\nIn Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces are strategically depleting Russian resources without launching a full-scale offensive. Meanwhile, Russian forces faced setbacks in Sumy, Avdiivka, Bakhmut, and other regions, suffering significant losses.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n visited Kyiv, signaling a shift in European support towards Ukraine. The Netherlands announced the imminent delivery of Patriot air defense systems and F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. NATO and the EU are bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities, with the U.S. also increasing pilot training.\n\nTurkey, Bulgaria, and Romania began mine-clearing operations in the Black Sea to secure grain shipments. Finland approved U.S. military base access, indicating increased Western military presence near Russia.\n\nUkrainian President Zelensky emphasized that negotiations with Russia are unlikely until a decisive outcome is achieved. European leaders, including Poland's Prime Minister, expressed confidence in Ukraine's eventual victory.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nAt the \"Asia Logistics Biennial - ESG30 Forum\" hosted by Caixin, Ni Xiaorong, President of Kuehne + Nagel Greater China, highlighted the challenges in reducing carbon emissions in the logistics industry due to geopolitical events like the Red Sea crisis and the Russia-Ukraine war. These events have forced commercial ships on the Asia-Europe route to alter their paths, increasing travel time by about 30%, and significantly raising logistics costs and carbon emissions. Additionally, shipping companies have increased vessel speeds to meet schedules, consuming more fuel and further escalating emissions. Despite plans to reduce logistics costs and carbon footprints post-pandemic, the current geopolitical situation has caused these metrics to exceed planned figures, putting substantial pressure on businesses.",

        "summary": "Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Astana on July 2, 2024, to attend the 24th Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit and visit Kazakhstan. The Chinese state media highlighted themes like the \"New Silk Road,\" \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" and \"Community of Shared Future for Mankind,\" suggesting significant benefits provided to Kazakhstan by China. Xi's arrival was marked by high-level reception and military escort.\n\nXi's visit includes discussions with Kazakh President Tokayev on bilateral relations, comprehensive cooperation, and regional and international issues. The SCO, founded by China and Russia in 2001, includes Central Asian countries, India, Iran, and Pakistan. The summit, held from July 3-4, will focus on economic and energy issues, the Russia-Ukraine war, and other geopolitical matters.\n\nThere is speculation about a potential meeting between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who will also attend the summit. Their discussions, if they meet, are expected to cover aid, cooperation, and Western sanctions. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and China's deepening ties with Russia have posed challenges for Kazakhstan, which seeks to maintain neutrality.\n\nXi will also visit Tajikistan, where China has promised significant investments in infrastructure projects. The summit and potential Xi-Putin meeting are closely watched for their implications on international relations and regional stability.",

        "summary": "Mercenary Li Jianwei has reported that the Ukrainian military has achieved NATO-level modernization, making it one of the most formidable forces globally. His unit, comprising around 100 soldiers, is well-equipped with transport vehicles, armored cars, drones, Starlink receivers, and anti-tank missiles. The U.S. has provided significant support, including Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles, enhancing Ukraine's combat capabilities.\n\nNATO's information support allows Ukrainian forces to anticipate Russian air and ground attacks, effectively countering them. This has forced the Russian military to adapt by using forest and urban warfare tactics. Strategically, the UK-supplied \"Storm Shadow\" missiles and U.S.-supplied HIMARS have inflicted significant damage on Russian forces and infrastructure.\n\nThe article also warns that the U.S. might apply similar strategies in Taiwan, suggesting a need for vigilance and study. Russian military adaptations are noted, with General Surovikin highlighted for his effective responses.",

The discussions focused on bilateral relations and opportunities for establishing peace. This visit came a day after Hungary assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union, giving it influence over the EU's upcoming agenda. Ukrainian officials had been negotiating for months to arrange this face-to-face meeting. Zelensky expressed hope that Hungary would effectively promote shared European values and goals. Despite Orb\u00e1n's frequent opposition to EU support for Ukraine and his efforts to limit sanctions against Russia, Zelensky emphasized the importance of Hungary's stance on achieving peace and regional security.",

        "summary": "The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are projected to generate $1-2 trillion in wealth by 2025, becoming a key region for economic development. Kashif Ansari, co-founder and CEO of Juwai IQI, highlighted that high economic growth in the region is attracting global investors. Key sectors contributing to this wealth include real estate, services, oil and gas, tourism, and technology.\n\nSignificant developments include Saudi Arabia's tourism sector growing by 32% in 2023, contributing $118 billion to the economy, and the UAE expected to attract a record 6,700 wealthy immigrants by the end of the year. Dubai's real estate market saw a 20% price increase in Q1 2024, with total transactions reaching 35,310. Oil prices are expected to range between $91 and $147 per barrel.\n\nJuwai IQI predicts the UAE's GDP will grow by 2-3%, and the GCC's GDP by 2-4%. The region is expected to maintain strong economic growth and stability over the next 3-5 years. Infrastructure investments, such as a new $34.85 billion terminal at Dubai World Central Airport, will further boost the real estate market.\n\nDespite challenges like inflation, global interest rate policies, geopolitical tensions, and the Russia-Ukraine war, Dubai remains an attractive market for international investors, particularly in luxury real estate.",

        "summary": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed he could end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours if re-elected. However, Russia's UN representative, Vassily Nebenzia, dismissed this notion, stating that the Ukraine crisis cannot be resolved in a single day. Trump's campaign spokesperson asserted that Trump is an efficient negotiator capable of resolving the conflict if elected. During a recent debate, Trump reiterated his confidence in resolving the war before his potential inauguration. The outcome of the U.S. presidential election on November 5 is significant for Moscow, as it will influence the extent of U.S. support for Ukraine. The Kremlin has indicated that any future peace proposal from a potential Trump administration must align with the realities on the ground, and President Putin remains open to negotiations.",

        "summary": "A shocking rumor has emerged from Russia, suggesting that Tatyana Shevtsova, the former Deputy Minister of Defense and a high-ranking female official, has defected to the West after being dismissed in mid-June. If true, Shevtsova would be the highest-ranking official to defect since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. Reports indicate she fled to France with large sums of cash and transferred billions of dollars in assets via cryptocurrency, without any interference from Russian authorities.\n\nThis potential defection could cause significant political turmoil in Russia, as Shevtsova was recently dismissed by President Vladimir Putin. Analysts speculate her defection might be linked to recent anti-corruption efforts by the Putin administration. Shevtsova, who managed military funds for 14 years, has been rumored to possess significant unexplained wealth, possibly tied to corruption.\n\nIf confirmed, her defection could lead to a major purge within the Russian government and military, as it raises questions about possible internal and external collusion. Additionally, Shevtsova's knowledge of military operations and finances could pose a severe threat if shared with Western intelligence, potentially demoralizing Russian forces and triggering further defections.\n\nThe situation underscores the deep-rooted corruption within Russia and the urgent need for effective measures to address it. The West's response to Shevtsova's defection, particularly regarding her assets, remains uncertain and could influence future defections. However, until official confirmation is provided, these remain speculative analyses.",

However, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman intervened to prevent this. The missiles, which are harder to detect and intercept, would have enhanced the Houthis' ability to attack ships in the Red Sea. The Saudi Crown Prince's intervention came after discussions with Putin during his visit to Saudi Arabia, where they agreed to reduce regional tensions. This move by Saudi Arabia has so far prevented the escalation of the Gaza conflict and highlighted the interconnectedness of global conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine war. Saudi Arabia's actions also reflect its closer ties with the U.S. and Israel, opposing any Russian involvement that could empower the Houthis, Iran's allies, near its borders.",

        "summary": "A high-ranking official from the Russian Ministry of Defense, Deputy Minister Tatyana Shevtsova, is rumored to have defected to France. The Kremlin has not officially responded, but the new Russian Defense Minister, Belousov, has shown anger. Shevtsova, who has a significant military and advisory background, is noted for her high rank and extensive financial control within the ministry. She allegedly prepared for her defection by acquiring expensive properties and assets abroad. \n\nHer defection raises concerns about systemic corruption within the Russian military, as she was involved in managing finances and compensations for soldiers. The situation suggests possible involvement of high-level officials, potentially including former President Medvedev, who appointed her in 2010. The defection could have serious implications, as Shevtsova possesses extensive knowledge of Russian military secrets and financial operations, which could impact global security dynamics.",

        "summary": "The article discusses a Taiwanese figure, Yu Beichen, who was once praised by Taiwanese pro-independence media as a military genius akin to Zhuge Liang. Born in Taipei in 1968 with ancestral roots in Shandong, Yu initially supported the unification of Taiwan and China, influenced by his family's history and the early Kuomintang (KMT) stance on unification. He served in the Taiwanese military, reaching the rank of major general, and was a prominent advocate for unification during Ma Ying-jeou's presidency.\n\nHowever, Yu's stance shifted dramatically after retiring from the military and leaving the KMT. Discontent with policies under President Tsai Ing-wen, particularly those affecting military salaries, Yu began appearing on pro-independence media, criticizing the KMT and China. He eventually joined the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), adopting increasingly extreme and often absurd anti-China rhetoric, which has been widely mocked.\n\nThe article concludes by asserting that Yu's transformation from a unification supporter to a pro-independence figure highlights his opportunism and lack of genuine principles. It emphasizes that the unification of Taiwan and China is an inevitable historical trend, and those who oppose it will ultimately be marginalized.",

        "summary": "In May 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin began his new term by replacing Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu, signaling a purge of the military's top ranks. Among those affected was former Deputy Defense Minister Tatiana Shevcova, who recently fled to France with substantial assets, seeking political asylum. This move has sparked speculation about its potential impact on Putin's regime, given Shevcova's knowledge of military finances.\n\nShevcova, a former tax official, rose to prominence in the Russian government, eventually becoming the youngest and only female Deputy Defense Minister. Her wealth includes properties in Russia and Europe. Following her dismissal, she quickly left Russia, raising concerns about the security risks if she shares sensitive information with foreign entities.\n\nPutin's recent reshuffle also saw the appointment of new deputy defense ministers, including Anna Tsivileva, believed to be a close relative of Putin, and other officials with significant ties to the Russian elite. This restructuring aims to address corruption and improve the efficiency of Russia's war economy amidst the ongoing conflict with Ukraine.",

        "summary": "In May 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin began a new term and subsequently replaced Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu, signaling a potential purge of the military's top ranks. Among those affected was former Deputy Defense Minister Tatiana Shevcova, who has reportedly fled to France with substantial assets. This move is speculated to have significant repercussions for Putin, as Shevcova possesses sensitive military information.\n\nShevcova, previously a high-ranking tax official, became Deputy Defense Minister in 2010, managing military finances and welfare. Her wealth includes luxury properties in Russia and Europe. Following Shoygu's dismissal, many anticipated Shevcova's removal, which occurred within two months. Russian media reported her seeking political asylum in France, raising concerns about potential security risks if she divulges military secrets.\n\nPutin's recent reshuffling of the Defense Ministry included appointing Anna Tsivileva, believed to be a close relative, as Deputy Defense Minister. This move is part of a broader effort to address corruption and inefficiency within the military, especially in the context of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. The appointments reflect Putin's reliance on trusted associates to implement his strategic objectives.",

        "summary": "The editorial discusses the political crisis within the U.S. Democratic Party following President Joe Biden's poor performance in a televised election debate. Biden's unclear speech and occasional incoherence have raised concerns about his cognitive health, leading to calls for him to withdraw from the race. The situation is complicated by the proximity of the November election and procedural and legal challenges within the party. The debate has significantly damaged Biden's image, with 72% of voters doubting his cognitive ability to serve as president, according to recent polls.\n\nLeft-leaning media outlets and social media are increasingly calling for Biden to step down, but the party lacks a clear alternative candidate. Key figures like former President Obama continue to support Biden, complicating any potential leadership change. The broader U.S. public is questioning how long Biden's cognitive issues have been concealed and who is effectively leading the country.\n\nThe debate also highlighted the decline in the quality of U.S. democratic politics, with both Biden and Trump failing to display decorum. Trump's chances of re-election have increased, with polls showing a significant rise in voter preference for him over Biden. This potential shift could lead to major changes in U.S. domestic and foreign policies, affecting global geopolitics, especially in regions like Ukraine, Israel, and the South China Sea.\n\nThe editorial concludes that the Democratic Party's crisis has far-reaching implications, necessitating swift action from Washington to stabilize the situation and minimize risks of misjudgment by international actors.",

        "summary": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that China aims to become a leading and dominant nation in military, economic, and diplomatic spheres over the coming decades. However, he noted that China's vision for the future differs from that of the U.S. and many other countries, prompting the U.S. to engage in intense competition with China to shape the future effectively.\n\nSpeaking at the Brookings Institution, Blinken discussed the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Palestine conflict, and competition with China. He emphasized the importance of international alliances in addressing shared challenges, citing China's investment in Russia's defense industry, which supports its aggression in Ukraine and impacts Europe significantly. He also mentioned that Asian partners are recognizing the global implications of such challenges.\n\nBlinken highlighted that China's actions contribute to global threats and stressed the need for the U.S. to manage its complex and crucial relationship with China. This involves standing firm on areas of deep disagreement while seeking cooperation in mutually beneficial areas, such as combating illegal fentanyl trafficking. He underscored the necessity of addressing each aspect of the U.S.-China relationship through competition, dialogue, and cooperation.",

        "summary": "The recent French parliamentary elections have resulted in a significant shift in the political landscape, with the far-right National Rally (RN) securing 33% of the vote, leading the first round. The left-wing New People's Ecological and Social Union (NUPES) came second with 28.5%, while President Emmanuel Macron's centrist coalition, Together, garnered only 22%, placing third. This outcome is a major setback for Macron, who had dissolved the National Assembly in hopes of gaining more control.\n\nThe RN's success marks a historic high in voter turnout since 1986, and projections suggest they could secure between 260 to 310 seats in the 577-seat assembly. If they reach 289 seats, they would control the parliament, potentially sidelining Macron's influence and positioning RN leader Jordan Bardella as a prime candidate for Prime Minister.\n\nThis shift has broader implications for Europe, as it may signal a rise in far-right influence across the continent, potentially altering EU dynamics and relations with the US and Russia. The far-right's pragmatic approach could also open new opportunities for China to strengthen economic ties with Europe, as these parties may seek more autonomous foreign policies less aligned with US interests.",

        "summary": "On June 25, the 853rd day of the Ukraine war, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin initiated a call with Russia's new Defense Minister, Belousov. This call, initiated by the U.S., aimed to reassure American citizens of their safety and demonstrate that U.S.-Russia military communication lines remain open, indicating stable and controlled relations. The call also served to reassure NATO members that Russia is still engaging in conventional warfare and not resorting to extreme measures, thus encouraging continued support for Ukraine.\n\nHistorically, such calls have led to increased military aid to Ukraine and significant Russian losses. For instance, after previous calls in May and October 2022, and March 2023, Ukraine received substantial military support, leading to key victories and shifts in the war dynamics.\n\nThe recent call comes as NATO prepares for its summit, aiming to set the tone for future operations against Russia. It also signals to Ukraine that the U.S. remains a deterrent to Russia, encouraging Ukraine to continue its offensive efforts. The call suggests that while Russia is intensifying its military actions, it has not yet decided to escalate to more extreme measures, providing a temporary sense of stability.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, which has lasted nearly three years and significantly impacted global affairs. Recently, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a firm statement that Russia will not withdraw its troops from Ukraine, emphasizing that the only way to end the war is for Ukraine to be completely defeated. Putin's comments came during a press conference in Vietnam, where he accused Ukraine of using delay tactics and disrupting peace negotiations.\n\nPutin also addressed the issue of nuclear weapons, suggesting that Russia might adjust its nuclear policies in response to the West lowering the threshold for their use. However, he clarified that Russia currently sees no benefit in being the first to use nuclear weapons.\n\nWith 700,000 Russian troops positioned at the Ukrainian border, Putin believes Russia has the upper hand and is prepared to continue the conflict until Ukraine surrenders. He also indicated that Russia is not intimidated by potential Western or NATO intervention, hinting at the possible use of nuclear weapons if necessary. The article concludes by noting the increasing pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the growing concern among Western nations led by the United States.",

        "summary": "Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, from July 2 to 6, and will also make state visits to Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. The summit, held on July 3-4, will focus on economic and energy issues, as well as the Russia-Ukraine war and other geopolitical matters. China will assume the SCO rotating presidency for 2024-2025. The potential meeting between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who will also attend the summit, has garnered significant attention. The summit comes amid deepening Sino-Russian ties since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began. Additionally, China is investing heavily in Central Asia, including major projects in Tajikistan. Concerns have been raised about Kazakhstan's authoritarian trends following a recent shooting of a Kazakh activist in Ukraine.",

        "summary": "Taiwan's \"representative to the U.S.,\" Bi-khim Hsiao, made assertive remarks in an interview on July 1, as reported by AFP. Hsiao stated that the more the People's Republic of China tries to \"suppress\" Taiwan's internal freedom and \"sovereignty,\" the more it pushes Taiwan away. She emphasized that mutual prosperity is better, but China must accept Taiwan's current status and existence.\n\nHsiao also mentioned that the Russia-Ukraine war has taught Taiwan and its allies the importance of building defensive capabilities and diplomatic understandings to prevent actions similar to those taken by the Kremlin in 2022. She suggested that Taiwan's defenses should be strong enough to make China reconsider any aggressive actions daily.\n\nThe article criticizes Hsiao's statements, comparing her to another pro-independence figure, Bi-khim Hsiao, and argues that Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has worsened cross-strait relations by not acknowledging the 1992 Consensus and promoting anti-China policies. The article asserts that unification is inevitable and that Taiwan's pro-independence actions will not succeed, especially with new punitive regulations in place.",

        "summary": "In May, India deployed a complete S-400 long-range air defense system at the Adampur Air Force Base in Punjab, located 100 km from the Pakistan-India border and 120 km from Lahore International Airport, posing a significant threat to Pakistan. India has ordered five S-400 systems, with three already delivered and deployed in central India, Gujarat, and Assam. The remaining two have been delayed due to the Russia-Ukraine war. To counter the threat from Pakistan's Northern Air Command, India redeployed the S-400 system from Gwalior to Adampur.\n\nIn response, Pakistan is considering deploying the FATAH-2 MLRS system to neutralize the S-400 threat. The FATAH-2, similar to the U.S. GMLRS, has a range of up to 450 km, capable of covering the Adampur base. The FATAH-2 was showcased at the IDEF-2023 exhibition in Turkey, with a reported range of 170 km and high accuracy. The system is believed to be an improved version of China's A-100 MLRS, first publicly displayed in January 2021.",

        "summary": "The article reports on Chinese President Xi Jinping's directive to execute Li Shangfu, a former defense minister, as a punishment for supporting Taiwan independence. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has issued a 22-point judicial opinion targeting \"stubborn Taiwan independence elements,\" which is seen as more severe than the National Security Law. The CCP has also expelled two former defense ministers, Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu, from the party and military, and they will face military court trials.\n\nThe article reveals that the CCP has circulated three lists for feedback: one for new Taiwan independence elements, one for those to be tried in absentia, and one for individuals in Taiwan to be protected. The lists include prominent Taiwanese politicians and public figures. The CCP's actions aim to support pro-unification forces in Taiwan and prepare for potential military action.\n\nAdditionally, the article discusses the broader implications of these actions, including the CCP's strategy to undermine Taiwan's democracy and the potential for increased military aggression. It also mentions North Korea's involvement in the Ukraine conflict as part of China's global strategy to distract the West and support Russia, thereby weakening Western intervention in East Asia.",

        "summary": "The article discusses recent developments in China's stance towards Taiwan and internal political purges. Key points include:\n\n1. **Judicial Opinions on Taiwan Independence**: China has issued 22 judicial opinions targeting \"stubborn Taiwan independence elements,\" which are seen as more severe than the National Security Law. This move follows Taiwan's legislative changes by the Kuomintang and White Party, suggesting collusion between these parties and the Chinese government.\n\n2. **Leadership and Lists**: Xi Jinping's Central Committee for Taiwan Affairs has circulated three lists for feedback: new Taiwan independence elements, those to be tried in absentia, and individuals in Taiwan to be protected. These lists include prominent Taiwanese politicians and public figures.\n\n3. **Punishment of Former Defense Ministers**: Xi Jinping has reportedly approved the death penalty for former Defense Minister Li Shangfu, citing severe political and organizational discipline violations. Another former Defense Minister, Wei Fenghe, is also implicated and may face a death sentence with a two-year reprieve.\n\n4. **Strategic Implications**: The article suggests that these actions are part of Xi Jinping's broader strategy to assert control over Taiwan and suppress dissent within the Chinese military. It also highlights the potential for increased military aggression towards Taiwan and the need for international preparedness.\n\n5. **North Korea's Role**: The article links North Korea's involvement in Ukraine to China's strategy, suggesting that China supports Russia to distract the West and weaken its response to potential Chinese actions in Taiwan.\n\nThe article emphasizes the urgency for Taiwan to address internal threats and for the international community to recognize and counter China's expansionist ambitions.",

        "summary": "A recent news article falsely claimed that President Joe Biden decided to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, citing an \"exclusive report\" from BillOReilly News Headquarters. However, this claim is baseless. In reality, Biden has the full support of his family and Democratic Party leaders and is unlikely to withdraw unless significant health issues arise. Polls show Biden slightly leading over Trump, with 46.7% of voters supporting Biden and 43.9% supporting Trump.\n\nThe article also speculates on the potential outcomes if Trump were to win the election, particularly regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It suggests that Trump would not allow Russia to win but would likely push for a compromise, potentially involving Ukraine ceding some territory while joining NATO. The article doubts that European countries would intervene militarily in Ukraine unless there is a direct threat to Europe.\n\nIn summary, the article debunks the rumor of Biden's withdrawal, highlights the current electoral landscape, and discusses potential geopolitical implications of a Trump presidency.",

D\u00fcben, who had worked at the university for nine years and held a high-level foreign talent visa valid until 2033, was informed by university officials that his comments were unacceptable and that he had to leave the country by May 30. The university canceled all his lectures and courses, and he was told that re-entry into China would be denied. D\u00fcben's comments included observations on China's strategic goals in Europe and the Russia-Ukraine war. The incident highlights the strict control over academic and media expressions in China.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the first debate between U.S. presidential candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump on June 27, highlighting the contrast between the democratic process in the U.S. and the authoritarian regime in China. It criticizes the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for its lack of transparency and public accountability, suggesting that the CCP's reliance on lies and violence to maintain power is leading to its inevitable decline. The article emphasizes that while American leaders must address voters' concerns to gain support, Chinese leaders focus on suppressing dissent and maintaining their own power. It also points out the economic struggles in China, including high unemployment and failing businesses, and criticizes the CCP's ineffective policies. The article concludes that the CCP's inability to genuinely care for its citizens and its poor handling of both domestic and international issues will lead to its downfall.",

        "summary": "The article recounts the experiences of Wenqi, a Chinese student who returned to Kyiv, Ukraine, in August 2023 amidst the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Despite the semblance of normalcy in Kyiv, with bustling streets and social activities, the city is still under the constant threat of air raids, leading to frequent air raid sirens and occasional explosions.\n\nWenqi describes the challenges of living in Kyiv, including significant power outages caused by Russian airstrikes on the city's largest power plant. These outages have disrupted daily life, making it difficult to maintain a consistent schedule and forcing residents to adapt to unpredictable electricity availability.\n\nWenqi's return to Kyiv was driven by his desire to resume his interrupted studies, despite the ongoing conflict. He details his arduous journey back to Ukraine, involving multiple flights and a bus ride from Moldova, due to the lack of air travel into Ukraine.\n\nThe article also highlights the economic hardships faced by Kyiv residents, with rising living costs and inflation outpacing wage increases. Wenqi notes the significant increase in prices for basic goods and services, making daily life increasingly expensive.\n\nDespite the war, cultural activities like music concerts have proliferated in Kyiv, often serving as fundraisers for the war effort. Wenqi finds solace in these events, which provide performance opportunities for music students and foster a sense of community.\n\nOverall, the article paints a picture of resilience and adaptation in the face of ongoing conflict, as residents of Kyiv navigate the challenges of war while striving to maintain a semblance of normal life.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the potential for conflict in the Taiwan Strait, focusing on the views of French scholar Emmanuel Lincot. Lincot argues that while China has shown military aggression towards Taiwan, it is unlikely to engage in a full-scale military invasion. Instead, China is expected to use economic measures to pressure Taiwan, which Lincot believes is a more cost-effective and rational approach.\n\nKey points include:\n- Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te is seen by China as a pro-independence figure, despite his attempts to show goodwill.\n- China has conducted large-scale military exercises as a show of force but is not preparing for an invasion.\n- Lincot suggests that economic pressure is a more likely strategy for China, given the high costs and global repercussions of a military conflict.\n- He highlights the economic challenges within China, such as high urban unemployment and dependency on food imports, which would be exacerbated by war and sanctions.\n- Lincot also notes the internal and external political dynamics, including China's support for Russia in the Ukraine conflict and the potential isolation similar to pre-World War II Japan.\n- The article concludes that Taiwan must rely on its own strength for survival, as international support may be limited.\n\nOverall, the article emphasizes the complexities and potential consequences of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, suggesting that economic strategies are more probable than military action.",

        "summary": "Germany's arms exports are set to reach a new record this year, with the first half of 2024 already achieving 60% of last year's total. The German Ministry of Economic Affairs reported a 30% year-on-year increase in arms exports, totaling at least \u20ac7.48 billion from January 1 to June 18, 2024. Nearly two-thirds of these exports, amounting to \u20ac4.88 billion, were sent to Ukraine, marking a historic high. Despite the ruling coalition's initial promise to limit arms deliveries, especially to non-EU and non-NATO countries, the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to a surge in exports. Germany is now Ukraine's second-largest arms supplier after the U.S. Other significant recipients include Singapore, India, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. The data was released at the request of Sevim Dagdelen from the newly formed BSW party, who criticized the government for increasing arms exports to conflict zones, warning it could lead to a European war.",

Key points include:\n\n1. **Ukrainian Counterattacks**: Ukraine has launched successful localized counterattacks, trapping around 30,000 Russian troops in Vovchansk. Ukrainian forces have also defeated Russia's elite 83rd Airborne Brigade.\n\n2. **F-16 Fighter Jets**: Ukraine has reportedly received its first batch of F-16 fighter jets, which have already been used in combat. However, the number of jets is limited, and Ukraine still faces challenges in achieving full air superiority.\n\n3. **Israeli Aid**: Israel plans to provide Ukraine with up to eight Patriot missile defense systems, pending U.S. approval or equivalent military aid to Israel.\n\n4. **Russian Losses and ICC Warrants**: Russia continues to suffer significant losses in personnel and equipment. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Army Chief Valery Gerasimov for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe article underscores the ongoing intensity of the conflict and the international efforts to support Ukraine while holding Russian officials accountable.",

        "summary": "On July 1, 2024, the 859th day of the Russia-Ukraine war, Ukraine launched missile and drone attacks on Crimea and six Russian states, with Russia claiming to have shot down 36 Ukrainian drones. Ukraine's ongoing attacks on Russian military infrastructure have left 30,000 Russian troops trapped after a failed attempt to capture Vovchansk, with significant Russian equipment losses reported. Ukraine has also downed 686 Russian aircraft since the war began.\n\nUkraine's first F-16 fighter jets have reportedly arrived and engaged in combat, though their numbers are limited. Western countries, including Denmark, Belgium, Norway, and the Netherlands, are expected to deliver more F-16s, but Ukraine still faces challenges in achieving full air superiority.\n\nAdditionally, Israel plans to provide Ukraine with eight Patriot missile defense systems, pending U.S. approval. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Russian officials Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov for war crimes, signaling increased international legal pressure on Russia.",

        "summary": "The British media outlet \"Tyrepress\" recently released the 2024 global top 20 tire companies list based on 2023 sales figures. Despite global challenges such as supply chain issues, inflation, and geopolitical tensions, the domestic Chinese tire market has thrived due to recovering demand, rapid growth in new energy vehicles, and strong export markets.\n\nKey highlights include:\n- Michelin, Bridgestone, Goodyear, and Continental maintained their top positions.\n- Pirelli moved up to fifth place, surpassing Sumitomo Rubber.\n- Sailun Group notably climbed two spots to enter the top ten for the first time, replacing Toyo Tires.\n\nSailun Group's rapid growth is attributed to its strategic global expansion and innovative product development. In 2023, Sailun's revenue increased by 18.61% to approximately 25.978 billion yuan, with a 35.84% year-on-year growth in the first quarter of 2024. The company has expanded its international presence with investments in Vietnam, Cambodia, Mexico, and planned projects in Indonesia and North America.\n\nOther notable changes include:\n- Nokian Tyres dropped out of the top 20 due to the Russia-Ukraine war, replaced by India's JK Tyre.\n- Kumho Tires rose to 14th place, while Giti Tire saw the largest drop, falling two places.\n- Nexen Tire improved its ranking, driven by strong performance in the European market.\n\nThe global tire market faces significant shifts, with Western companies reducing production and workforce due to economic pressures, while Chinese companies are expanding their global footprint. This dynamic is reshaping the competitive landscape, with Chinese tire manufacturers gaining a stronger position in the international market.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the challenges Ursula von der Leyen faces in her bid for re-election as President of the European Commission in 2024. Key points include:\n\n1. **Election Dynamics**: The recent European Parliament elections saw traditional parties (European People's Party, Socialists, and Renew Europe) lose seats but maintain a majority. Meanwhile, far-right parties gained significant ground in France, Germany, and Italy, complicating von der Leyen's re-election efforts and causing internal negotiations to be difficult.\n\n2. **Leadership and Power Distribution**: Leaders from Italy, Poland, and other EU countries are vying for influence in the new EU leadership, adding pressure on von der Leyen. Balancing these internal conflicts will be a significant challenge during her potential second term.\n\n3. **Political Shifts**: The European political landscape is shifting towards conservatism. While there is consensus on strict anti-immigration policies, there are differences on economic, climate, and foreign policies, including relations with Russia and China.\n\n4. **Negotiation Outcomes**: Despite the rise of the far-right, von der Leyen's re-election is supported by key EU leaders from Germany, Spain, France, and the Netherlands. However, internal party dynamics and the need to appease various factions, including the far-right, complicate the process.\n\n5. **Future Challenges**: If re-elected, von der Leyen will face a more fragmented and conservative European Parliament. This will impact EU policies on immigration, economic governance, climate change, and defense, as well as relations with Russia and China.\n\nThe article underscores the complexity of maintaining stability and unity within the EU amidst rising far-right influence and internal power struggles.",

        "summary": "A survey by the Korea Economic Research Institute, under the Federation of Korean Industries, revealed that over 60% of major South Korean companies expect an increase in exports in the second half of 2024 compared to the same period last year. The survey, conducted by Mono Research, included the top 1,000 companies in twelve key export industries. Notably, the shipbuilding, petrochemical, biopharmaceutical, automotive parts, and electrical electronics sectors are optimistic about export growth. However, the steel and petroleum products sectors anticipate a decline.\n\nThe primary reasons for expected export growth include improved industry conditions and enhanced product competitiveness through new technologies. Conversely, companies expecting a decrease cite rising commodity and oil prices and economic slowdowns in key markets like China.\n\nDespite the optimistic export outlook, 79% of respondents believe that profitability will either remain the same or worsen due to increased raw material costs, lower export prices, and higher import costs due to exchange rate fluctuations. Key risk factors include rising raw material prices, slow global demand recovery, and geopolitical tensions.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, companies plan to cut costs, raise product prices, and diversify supply chains. They also suggest that the government should stabilize the foreign exchange market, provide tax support for raw material imports, expand corporate tax reductions, prevent logistics disruptions, and increase policy-based financial support.",

        "summary": "This news article discusses recent setbacks in two major U.S. defense projects and speculates on whether Americans might blame the Russia-Ukraine war for these issues in the future. The key points are:\n\n1. **Sentinel ICBM Project**: The project leader was dismissed, and the project is under severe scrutiny by Congress due to cost overruns. The Sentinel missile is intended to replace the aging Minuteman III missiles, but the project has faced numerous delays and technical challenges, including the need to refurbish old missile silos, which has proven more costly than anticipated.\n\n2. **Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) Project**: The U.S. Air Force is reconsidering the future of this sixth-generation fighter jet project. There are concerns about the project's feasibility and cost, with potential cancellation being considered. The article suggests that the defense industry, particularly companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, is struggling with innovation and efficiency.\n\n3. **U.S. Arms Sales to Taiwan**: The U.S. approved the sale of drones to Taiwan at exorbitant prices, raising questions about the value and effectiveness of these purchases. The article criticizes the high costs and suggests that these sales are more about political posturing than practical defense.\n\n4. **Broader Implications**: The article argues that these issues reflect deeper problems in the U.S. defense industry and military strategy, exacerbated by monopolistic practices and a decline in technological and industrial superiority. It suggests that future military failures might be blamed on the Russia-Ukraine war, similar to how past failures were attributed to counterinsurgency operations.\n\nOverall, the article paints a picture of a U.S. defense sector facing significant challenges and inefficiencies, with potential long-term implications for national security.",
