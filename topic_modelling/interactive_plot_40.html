The conflict began with significant geopolitical shifts, including the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych on February 20, 2014. This event was pivotal, setting the stage for Russia\u2019s aggressive actions. Western countries quickly recognized the threat posed by Russia's Federation Council\u2019s authorization to use military force in Crimea on March 1, 2014. This move not only exacerbated regional tensions but also prompted immediate international condemnation. Western support for Ukraine has been a critical factor in its ongoing defense efforts. In the wake of Crimea\u2019s controversial referendum to join Russia on March 16, 2014, which was widely condemned internationally, Western nations began providing significant military aid. This support was further underscored by the tragic events of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 being downed by a missile over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014. The global outrage that followed this incident highlighted the need for a coordinated response to Russian aggression. The signing of the Minsk agreements in September 2014 and February 2015 aimed to halt hostilities and establish a fragile ceasefire. However, these agreements faced numerous challenges in implementation. Despite these setbacks, Western nations continued to support Ukraine through military and economic assistance, recognizing the strategic importance of bolstering Ukraine\u2019s defenses against ongoing threats. The conflict\u2019s escalation with Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, brought renewed urgency to Western support.

Despite a robust international response, including military aid and economic support, several delays and internal disagreements among Western allies have raised concerns about the sustainability of this aid. The conflict, which began in February 2022 with Russia's full-scale invasion, has seen substantial international involvement. However, the timeliness of aid delivery has been a recurring issue. On March 16, 2022, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning Russia\u2019s invasion, signaling a global commitment to Ukraine\u2019s defense. Yet, reports indicate that some of the promised aid faced significant delays. The issue of timely aid has been particularly critical as Ukraine strives to regain control over its territories and stabilize the region. The delays in delivering crucial military equipment and financial support have been a point of contention. Internal disagreements among Western allies have also complicated the aid efforts. The coordination among nations, while intended to be unified, has sometimes resulted in conflicting priorities and slow decision-making processes. For instance, the military exercises conducted by Russia on November 25, 2017, highlighted the growing threat, but the response from Western nations lacked immediacy. These delays have led to questions about the effectiveness of the aid in bolstering Ukraine\u2019s defense. As the conflict continues, the potential reduction in future support remains a concern. The sustainability of aid has been debated, especially in light of internal political shifts within donor countries.
