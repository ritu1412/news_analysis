        "body": "The outcome of Mandate 2024 was a bitter pill for the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) in Nagaland and the National People's Party (NPP) in Meghalaya's Tura Lok Sabha seats.\n\nThese were constituencies where the NDPP and the NPP had a stranglehold for years. But the party that was hit the hardest was the Assam-based All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) led by Maulana Badruddin Ajmal, a perfume baron-turned-politician.\n\nElection Results 2024: Highlights on June 5, 2024\n\nThe AIUDF, born after the Supreme Court scrapped the allegedly pro-foreigners Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act in 2005, sought to do what its predecessor, the United Minority Front could not -- make the Bengali-origin Muslims a political force.\n\nThe party went from 10 seats in the 2006 Assembly elections to 18 in 2011 before the 'Modi wave' saw its tally dipping to 13 in 2016. The party's victories, mostly in the Muslim-dominated constituencies, were seen as an outcome of a shift in the minority vote from the Congress and former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi's tendency to ignore Mr. Ajmal.\n\nThe Congress has traditionally been seen as a beneficiary of two large \"vote banks\" -- the Muslims who constitute more than 34% of Assam's population and the Adivasis or \"tea tribes\" who comprise almost 20% of the voters.\n\nThe AIUDF, Congress and some smaller parties formed a pre-poll alliance before the 2021 Assam polls. The alliance helped the AIUDF more than the Congress as it won 16 of the 20 seats it contested.\n\nControversial statements\n\nThe AIUDF walked out of the alliance as the Congress kept accusing it of being the B team of the BJP. Mr. Ajmal's statements, often controversial, were also seen as fuel for the BJP's vehicle of polarisation.\n\nIn the Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Ajmal won the Dhubri seat for the first time in 2009 and retained it in 2014 and 2019 by defeating his nearest Congress rivals by huge margins. The AIUDF put up its best performance by winning three seats, the same as that of the Congress.\n\nOver the last couple of years, it was becoming apparent that the AIUDF was losing ground with people in its strongholds speaking out against the party's strategies that were allegedly against the secular entities. It also did not help that Mr. Ajmal was seen as having fielded candidates in the Muslim-dominated Nagaon and Karimganj primarily to harm the Congress.\n\nThe 2023 delimitation resulted in an increase in Muslim voters in Nagaon and Karimganj losing its status as a seat reserved for the Scheduled Castes. Delimitation also increased the number of Muslim voters in Dhubri, the constituency Mr. Ajmal represented, which already had more than 70% Muslims.\n\nWhile Pradyut Bordoloi of the Congress retained Nagaon, the BJP's Kripanath Mallah managed to overcome the challenge from Hafiz Rashid Ahmed Choudhury of the Congress to retain Karimganj after a see-saw battle.\n\nThe Hindu had reported how Mr. Ajmal would face his toughest test in Dhubri from former Minister Rakibul Hussain of the Congress. The latter won by a record margin of 10,12,476 votes.\n\nMr. Ajmal's highest margin of victory was 2,29,730 in 2014.\n\n\"It [losing Dhubri] is a big blow. We will take our time to analyse what went wrong in a constituency that made me an MP for three consecutive terms,\" he said on Wednesday.\n\nThe threadbare analysis, he asserted, would help the AIUDF stage a comeback in the 2026 Assembly elections.\n\nRead Comments",

        "summary": "In the 2024 elections, the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) led by Maulana Badruddin Ajmal faced significant setbacks, particularly in Assam. The AIUDF, which had previously gained political traction among Bengali-origin Muslims, saw a decline in support. Ajmal, who had won the Dhubri seat in 2009, 2014, and 2019, lost to Congress's Rakibul Hussain by a record margin. The AIUDF's decline was attributed to controversial statements by Ajmal and strategic missteps, including fielding candidates in Muslim-dominated areas to harm the Congress. The party plans to analyze these failures to strategize for a comeback in the 2026 Assembly elections.",

        "body": "Hyderabad (Telangana) [India], June 5 (ANI): After winning from the Bhongir Lok Sabha constituency, Congress MP Chamala Kiran Kumar Reddy took a dig at the exit poll predictions that predicted a big majority for the BJP and said that the \"false\" predictions caused a loss of about Rs 20 lakh crore to investors in the share market.\n\nThe Congress candidate from the Bhongir parliamentary seat, who was declared the winner from the Lok Sabha seat, expressed gratitude to the people for their support.\n\nSpeaking to ANI here on Wednesday, Reddy said, \"People have blessed me with the maximum majority. The public has continued the same rhythm in the assembly polls. At the same time, so many media channels have been exposed due to their false exit poll predictions.\"\n\n\"The media speculated wrong numbers on the eve of counting day, which has made the common man lose 20 lakh crore rupees in the share market. This is called the Satta Market Bazar. The total exit polls are false, influenced by the Gujarat model and Gujarat politicians,\" he said.\n\n\"The Gujarat Satta Market people have influenced these exit polls. Even the renowned exit polls have failed this time because they were influenced,\" stated Reddy.\n\nKey contenders in the Bhongir Lok Sabha Constituency for the 2024 elections included Kyama Mallesh from the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), Boora Narsaiah Goud from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Chamala Kiran Kumar Reddy from the Indian National Congress (INC).\n\nThe Bhongir constituency has been an important political battleground, influencing regional politics significantly.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Komati Reddy Venkata Reddy from the Congress emerged victorious, closely followed by TRS candidate Boora Narsaiah Goud, while PV Shyam Sundar Rao from the BJP secured third place.\n\nSimilarly, in the 2014 general election, Boora Narsaiah Goud of TRS won the seat by defeating Congress's Raj Gopal Reddy.\n\nWith its rich electoral history and dynamic political contests, the Bhongir parliamentary constituency continues to shape the political narrative of Telangana, making it a significant battleground for various political parties.\n\nA steep selloff in the Indian stock market on Tuesday, June 4, led to a massive loss for investors, wiping out approximately Rs 20 lakh crore within the first few minutes of trading.\n\nAs per reports, market experts highlighted that the stock market had already priced in a significant majority for the NDA, based on exit poll predictions. However, the unexpected tightness in early election results spooked investors.\n\nIndian stocks witnessed a bloodbath on the day the Lok Sabha results were announced, where the incumbent BJP performed below par and seemed to fall short of exit poll predictions and the majority mark on its own.\n\nMany investors booked the profits they accumulated from the gains they made a day after the exit poll predictions indicated a a comfortable majority for the BJP.

He also mentioned that there were some seats, where the BJP lost by a small margin.\n\n\"NDA got more than 290 seats and NDA government is going to be formed at the centre and Narendra Modi will become the Prime Minister for the third time. Our party will analyse it (why the seats decreased),\" Shettar said. \"In every election, there is win and lose. In some seats, we lose by a small margin. Last time results were surprising even for us,\" he added.\n\nJagdish Shettar won the Belgaum parliamentary seat with a margin of 1,78,437 votes. He defeated Congress' Mrinal R Hebbalkar who got 5,83,592 votes. However, the BJP will observe that its performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka has declined, with the party's seats reducing from 26 in the 2019 elections to 17 in 2024.\n\nJanata Dal (Secular), which contested as an ally with the BJP in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), won two seats, taking the total tally of the alliance to 19. The Congress's performance in its ruled state has improved, increasing from one seat in 2019 to nine seats in 2024.\n\nCongress won the most controversial Hassan seat after sitting MP Prajwal Revanna was accused in an obscene video case. Revanna lost the seat to Congress's Shreyas M Patel by a margin of 42,649 votes. Polling for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka was held in the second and third phases on April 26 and May 7, respectively.\n\nAs per the results announced by the Election Commission of India on Tuesday, the BJP won 240 seats and the Congress 99 seats. BJP had won 303 seats in the 2019 general elections and 282 seats in the 2014 general elections.

        "title": "Modi shifts gears: Shuns 'Jai Shree Ram' for 'Jai Jagannath' in Lok Sabha Poll victory speech. Here's why",
        "body": "In an unexpected move, Narendra Modi on Tuesday started his Lok Sabha election 2024 victory speech by chanting \"Jai Jagannath\" instead of usual chant 'Jai Shree Ram'. In the speech, he conciously avoided the mention Uttar Pradesh and Maharashta, where BJP witnessed drubbing losses.\n\nDespite BJP's focus on the Ram Temple as a key campaign issue, Samajwadi Party's Dalit leader Awadhesh Prasad defeated the BJP's sitting MP in Ayodhya, part of the Faizabad constituency, a suprising political shift. Meanwhile, The BJP is set to form its first government in Odisha, winning 78 of 147 assembly seats. This victory ends over two decades of Naveen Patnaik's Biju Janata Dal (BJD) rule, which secured 51 seats, while Congress won 14.\n\nAs per political experts, 'Jai Jagannath' instead on 'Jai Shree Ram' is a clear indication of the setbacks and gains made by BJP in Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, resptectively.\n\n\"In Odisha, BJP is all set to form the government and in the Lok Sabha elections too Odisha has performed well. This will be the first time that Jagannath's land will have a BJP CM. BJP has also won seats in Kerala. Our workers in Kerala have made many sacrifices. For many generations they have been fighting and doing seva. And for generations, not years, the moment they waited for has come today.\"\n\nOfficial results from the Election Commission showed the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance won 294 of the 543 seats, more than the 272 needed for a majority but far fewer than what had been expected. For the first time since the BJP swept to power in 2014, it did not secure a majority on its own, winning 240 seats, far fewer than the record 303 it won in the 2019 election.\n\nIn the election, the opposition Congress party won 99 seats, improving its tally from 52 in the 2019 polls. Among its key allies, the Samajwadi Party won 37 seats in Uttar Pradesh in a major upset for the BJP, the All India Trinamool Congress took 29 seats in West Bengal, and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam won 22 seats in Tamil Nadu.\n\nCombined, the opposition INDIA coalition won a total of 232 seats.\n\nMilestone Alert!

The BJP faced significant losses in Uttar Pradesh, where Samajwadi Party's Dalit leader Awadhesh Prasad won in Ayodhya, but achieved a historic victory in Odisha, ending over two decades of Biju Janata Dal rule by winning 78 of 147 assembly seats. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured 294 of 543 seats, falling short of a majority on its own with 240 seats, a decline from 303 in 2019. The opposition Congress party improved its tally to 99 seats, and the INDIA coalition collectively won 232 seats.",

        "body": "Jaipur, Jun 5 (PTI) After the ruling BJP's poor show in the Lok Sabha polls in Rajasthan, the focus is now on first-time Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma who was chosen by the party high command to lead the state last December.\n\nSharma, also a one-time MLA, may face challenges ahead as his cabinet colleague Kirodi Lal Meena, who was among the contenders for the top post after the BJP won the assembly elections, has indicated that he will resign taking responsibility of the party's defeat on seats under his responsibility.\n\nAlso Read | What Is the Oath of the Prime Minister of India? Who Administers the Oath of Office and Secrecy to PM?.\n\nIf Meena resigns, it is likely to put pressure on other ministers whose areas also saw poor performance in the general elections.\n\nOn the other hand, PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra's stature in the Congress is expected to go up as the party has been able to win parliamentary seats after a decade. The party, in January this year, had also won assembly election on Karanpur seat despite the BJP making its candidate a minister.\n\nAlso Read | ICAI CA Foundation Exam 2024: Admit Card for CA Foundation June Examination Released at eservices.icai.org, Know Steps To Download Hall Ticket.\n\nIn the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP managed to secure 14 out of 25 seats, with the Congress winning eight and its INDIA bloc partners bagging three seats. This is a significant change from 2014 when the BJP won all 25 seats and 2019 when the BJP got 24 seats and its ally Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) one.\n\nThis time, the BJP lost 10 seats compared to 2019, while the RLP contested in alliance with the Congress on Nagaur seat and emerged victorious.\n\nThe BJP's vote share also saw a notable decline of 9.23 percentage point in 2024 compared to 2019, while the Congress experienced a modest increase of 3.67 percentage point in its vote share.\n\nAlong with the BJP state president CP Joshi, party's election campaign in the state was run by CM Sharma.\n\nSince Joshi was also contesting elections from Chittorgarh seat, Sharma held rallies and meetings across the state.\n\nSenior BJP leader and former CM Vasundhara Raje was missing from the campaign in the state as she focused on the Jhalawar-Baran seat from where her son Dushyant Singh was contesting.\n\nMajor setback for the BJP came from eastern Rajasthan, where it lost Bharatpur, Karauli-Dholpur, Tonk-Sawaimadhopur and Dausa seats. Significantly, Bharatpur is the hometown of CM Sharma.\n\nThe Congress has won all these seats.\n\nIn Shekhawati region, the BJP faced defeat in Churu, Jhunjhunu, Sikar and Nagaur seats while the most embarrassing defeat came from Barmer where Union minister Kailash Chaudhary lost election with a huge margin of 4,17,943 seats and stood third.\n\nWinning margin of Union ministers Arjun Ram Meghwal in Bikaner and Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in Jodhpur, and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla in Kota-Bundi also reduced as compared to the 2019 elections.\n\nCM Sharma held as many as 89 public meetings and rallies in Rajasthan and 62 in other states, including Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Odisha, West Bengal and Haryana.\n\n\"In the period of three months, the CM took several decisions to curb paper leaks and control the law and order situation. Besides, a tripartite agreement on Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project was signed between the Centre and Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh governments for addressing water needs of eastern Rajasthan,\" an aide of the CM said.\n\nApart from that, an agreement with Haryana was signed regarding Yamuna water to resolve water problems in the Shekhawati region.\n\n\"The BJP government started work with a proactive approach to deliver on promises made in the election manifesto. The CM led the election campaign but the loss happened due to various factors such as farmer issues, and the opposition raising SC/ST reservation issue,\" a BJP leader said.\n\nFive MLAs -- three of the Congress, one of RLP, one of Bharat Adivasi Party -- have won the Lok Sabha elections and bypolls to their assembly seats will be held in coming months.\n\nThe BJP leader said that the performance of the CM and the government will be judged in the assembly bypolls.\n\n\"There might be some challenges including assembly bypolls ahead, but the CM is likely to continue,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition Congress targeted the BJP and questioned the performance of the government in the state.\n\nFormer chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that people within a few months have regretted giving mandate to the BJP in the assembly elections.\n\n\"The state government has failed to deliver and people have realised that the Congress government was better than this government,\" he said.\n\nGehlot also targeted the government over law and order issue.",

        "summary": "The BJP's poor performance in the recent Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan has put Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma under scrutiny. Sharma, a first-time CM, faces potential challenges, especially as his cabinet colleague Kirodi Lal Meena has indicated he might resign due to the party's defeat in his areas. The BJP won only 14 out of 25 seats, a significant drop from previous elections, while the Congress and its allies secured 11 seats. This shift has elevated the stature of Congress PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra. The BJP's vote share also declined by 9.23 percentage points compared to 2019. Sharma, who led the election campaign along with state president CP Joshi, held numerous rallies but faced setbacks, particularly in eastern Rajasthan and the Shekhawati region. Despite these challenges, Sharma's government has made efforts to address issues like water scarcity and law and order. The performance of Sharma and his government will be further evaluated in upcoming assembly bypolls. Meanwhile, the opposition Congress, led by former CM Ashok Gehlot, has criticized the BJP's governance, claiming the public regrets their mandate.",

        "body": "Narendra Modi is expected to be sworn in for his third term on Saturday. Reuters\n\nThe BJP-led NDA is set to return to power with Prime Minister Narendra Modi reportedly being sworn in on Saturday.\n\nThe campaigning for the elections, which was conducted from 19 April to 1 June in seven phases, saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi hold more than 300 rallies, travelling tirelessly almost every day to multiple locations.\n\nBut how has the political landscape of the country changed since 2014?\n\nIn 2014, the BJP had been out of power for ten years after the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA with its 'India Shining' slogan lost its majority.\n\nThe country, which had seen a decade of Congress rule, was fed up of the myriad scandals and corruption scams.\n\nThe BJP projected Narendra Modi - then the chief minister of Gujarat - as its prime ministerial face.\n\nThe BJP secured the first majority since 1984 at the election, on a promise of reviving manufacturing and investment to create millions of jobs.\n\nThe party which won 282 seats - enough to form a majority in Parliament on its own - netted a 31 per cent vote share\n\nMeanwhile, the National Democratic Alliance won 336 seats with a 38.5 per cent vote share.\n\nThe election saw the BJP dominate the Hindi heartland with the alliance picking up a mammoth 73 seats in UP, 41 seats in Maharashtra, 31 seats in Bihar, and 27 seats in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe NDA also made massive gains in Gujarat (26 seats), Rajasthan (25 seats), Delhi (7 seats) Himachal Pradesh (4 seats) and Uttarakhand (five seats), Jharkhand (12 seats), Chhattisgarh (11 seats) and Haryana (7 seats).\n\nThe jaw-dropping performance was dubbed the 'Modi wave.'\n\nHis pledge to overhaul the flagging economy won over voters, along with his rags-to-riches story and reputation as a clean and efficient chief minister.\n\nThe UPA, on the other hand, was reduced to just 60 seats - of which the Congress, then lead by Rahul Gandhi, won 44 seats.\n\nThe grand old party won a 19.3 per cent vote share.\n\nThe Congress picked up just two sedates in Uttar Pradesh - in its strongholds of Amethi and Raebareli.\n\nThe UPA and Congress won just 12 seats in the Hindi heartland.\n\nModi was sworn in as Prime Minister of India on 26 May, 2014.\n\nModi, the country's 15th prime minister, replaced Manmohan Singh.\n\n2019\n\nIn 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seeking his second straight term.\n\nWhile most pollsters said that the BJP would return, they did predict a reduced footprint.\n\nWhich is why many people were shocked in 2019 when the BJP increased its tally in Parliament to a massive 303 seats with a 37.46 per cent vote share.\n\nThe party made history by increasing its majority in a second straight landslide election win.\n\nThe NDA, meanwhile, got 353 seats.\n\nYet again it was the Hindi heartland that powered the BJP to a massive win.\n\nThe party won 74 seats in Uttar Pradesh, 39 in Bihar and 28 in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe party also won 77 seats in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Delhi plus another nine in Chhattisgarh and 11 in Jharkhand.\n\nIn all, the BJP picked up 238 seats in the Hindi heartland.\n\nThe Congress, being led by Rahul Gandhi, came a cropper again.\n\nThe grand old party won just 52 seats on its own with its vote share falling under 10 per cent.\n\nThe UPA won 91 seats.\n\nEven worse for the Congress was that Rahul lost from the party's prestigious Amethi constituency to Smriti Irani.\n\nModi was sworn in for his second term on 30 May, 2019, in front of 8,000 people including South Asian leaders, Bollywood stars and leading political figures.\n\nRahul , whose Congress party suffered a second straight humiliating defeat, was among the crowd with his mother Sonia, the former Congress leader.\n\nThe fallout led to Rahul resigning as Congress chief - seemingly for good - despite the vehement pleas of people in his party.\n\n2024\n\nModi in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls was seeking his third straight term - to equal the record of India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nBefore the polls, the NDA had set itself a lofty goal of 400 seats in the Lok Sabha.\n\nThough three exit polls gave the BJP a chance to achieve its '400 paar' goal, things turned out far different than expected.\n\nThe BJP won 240 seats - 32 less than the majority needed to form a government on its own - a far cry from the 303 and 282 seats it had won in 2019 and 2014 respectively.\n\nIt is the Hindi heartland that is in the spotlight yet again.\n\nThe BJP has suffered crushing losses in three Hindi heartland states including in politically-crucial Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana.\n\nThe party got no seats in Tamil Nadu and lost ground in Karnataka.\n\nHowever, the BJP made inroads into Kerala, winning a seat for the first time in a state where the Congress and the Left are the major political forces, and in Telangana where it won eight seats.\n\nPopular Malayalam actor Suresh Gopi won the Thrissur seat in Kerala to help the lotus bloom.\n\nHowever, the NDA alliance netted 292 seats with 42.8 per cent vote share.\n\nThis after the BJP's key allies N Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Nitish Kumar's JD(U) bagged 16 and 12 seats in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar respectively.\n\nThe elections also highlighted the revival of the main Opposition Congress party under Rahul Gandhi, and the unexpected role of the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh under Akhilesh Yadav as a giant slayer.\n\nThe Congress, which is is part of the Opposition INDIA alliance, won 99 seats in 2024.\n\nThe party ate into the BJP's share in Rajasthan and Haryana.\n\nThe Trinamool Congress, another key ally of the Opposition alliance, won in 29 seats in West Bengal.\n\nThe BJP, which had 18 seats in Bengal in the previous the last Lok Sabha election, won in 12 seats.\n\nPreparing to take office for a record-equalling historic third term, Prime Minister Modi pledged to work with all states, regardless of the party in power, to build a developed India. India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had served three consecutive terms.\n\nIn his first speech after the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections on Tuesday, Modi laid out his vision for the third term saying it would be a tenure of big decisions and key emphasis would be on uprooting corruption.\n\nThis is the first time that Modi, 73, will be dependent on allies to remain in the government since he came into politics.\n\n\"The fight against corruption is becoming tougher by the day. Corruption is being shamelessly glorified for political interest. In our third term, NDA will focus a lot on rooting out corruption of all kinds,\" Modi said.\n\nCongress chief Mallikarjun Kharge termed the poll outcome as the \"victory of the people and that of democracy\".\n\n\"We had been saying that this battle is between public and Modi&mldr; This mandate is against Modi. This is his political and moral defeat. It is a big defeat for a person who sought votes in his own name. He has suffered a moral setback,\" Kharge told reporters at the AICC headquarters, flanked by Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi after the good showing by the Congress.",

        "body": "Devendra Fadnavis Wants To Be Relieved Of His Duties As He Takes Responsibility For BJP's Poor Show In Maharashtra\n\nThe Lok Sabha elections 2024 finally suffices with the results out on 4th June. This time, the Indian General assembly elections indeed hit various unexpected turns. Especially with some wins particularly standing out.\n\nFor example, four young candidates, who are all 25 years old, were also elected to Parliament as a consequence of the election. As per the ECI data, these four candidates from constituencies across Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar are the youngest candidates who have emerged victorious these Lok Sabha elections.\n\nThese Four Gen-Z candidates indeed managed to defeat even the veterans. So, let's take a look at their names -\n\nIn 2019, the Samajwadi party fielded a five-time MLA and former minister in the UP cabinet, name, Indrajeet Saroj from Kaushambi Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh. But Mr. Saroj lost to BJP's Vinod Kumar Sonkar.\n\nBut, five years later, Indrajeet Saroj's son, Pushpendra Saroj steps in the electoral battle and avenges his father's defeat by defeating his father's rival Mr. Sonkar by 1 Lakh votes.\n\nHe has also set record for the highest margin win by the youngest parliamentarian.\n\nA Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader, became the youngest Member of Parliament in India on Tuesday after she won the Lok Sabha elections from Bihar's Samastipur. She defeated the Congress party's candidate, Sunny Hazari, by 187251 votes.\n\nShe is also 25 years old abd a third generation politician. Shambhavi Choudhary's father, Ashok Choudhary is a JDU leader. He is one of the most influential ministers in Nitish Kumar's cabinet.\n\nHer father had switched to JD(U) from the Congress.\n\nTwenty-five-year-old Sanjana Jatav of the Congress is set to be one of the youngest Members of Parliament (MPs) after her victory in the Bharatpur Lok Sabha seat of Rajasthan. Ms Jatav registered an impressive win over BJP's Ramswaroop Koli by 51,983 votes.\n\nShe hails from a Dalit community and is one of the youngest Members of Parliaments elected to the 18th Lok Sabha.\n\nIn the 2023 Rajasthan Assembly elections, Ms Jatav lost to BJP's Ramesh Khedi by a minuscule margin of 409 votes. Putting the disappointment of defeat behind her, she ran a spirited campaign for Lok Sabha elections and registered a historic win for the grand old party, which had failed to open its account in the 2019 polls.\n\nThe 25 year old, has been elected MP from Machhalishahr Parliamentary seat that her father Toofani Saroj represented from 2009 to 2014. In this election, the first-time Parliamentarian defeated BP Saroj by 35,850 votes. While Priya Saroj got 4,51,292 votes, BP Saroj got 4,15,442 votes. In 2019, BJP's BP Saroj had won by 181 votes.\n\nAs Hindustan Times reported, On the question if she entered politics suddenly, Priya said, \"I always played an active role in social activities in college and university during studies. I have grown up in a political environment. In the 2022 elections, my father contested the assembly elections. I looked after the campaigning during the election. So, poll politics is not new to me. I know the people of the area. With the blessings of people, I won the election.",

        "body": "Among the losses suffered by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in West Bengal in the 2024 Lok Sabha election, two seats stand out -- Hooghly and Barrackpore. Sprawled across the opposing banks of the Hooghly river and in strategic proximity to Kolkata, both constituencies caused a significant setback to the BJP's performance in the State with the defeat of Arjun Singh and Locket Chatterjee.\n\nIn Barrackpore, Mr. Singh lost to the Trinamool Congress's Partha Bhowmick by a margin of 64,438 votes. In Hooghly, Trinamool candidate and actor Rachna Banerjee defeated Ms. Chatterjee by a margin of 76,853 votes.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Textiles, India has 98 composite jute mills of which 75 are in West Bengal. Many of these are nestled across Hooghly and Barrackpore.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Ms. Chatterjee, an actor-turned-politician, defeated her Trinamool rival by a margin of over 70,000 votes. The same year, after the alleged suicide of an out-of-work jute mill worker in Chinsurah, she blamed the Trinamool government for the rampant closure of jute mills in the region and the \"brainwashing\" of labour unions.\n\n\"The majority of jute belt workers in West Bengal are Hindi speakers and the BJP candidates had a huge impact on them in 2019,\" said Anadi Sahu, general secretary of the West Bengal unit of Centre of Indian Trade Unions, the labour arm of the CPI(M). As of this year, he said, around 2.5 lakh workers are employed in Bengal's jute industry. He said that in a Lok Sabha election, the Hindi-speaking workers often reflect the popular sentiment of North India's Hindi-speaking belt, particularly the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. \"That's why if you notice, the wind blew in a different direction this year both in Uttar Pradesh as well as in Hooghly and Barrackpore constituencies,\" he said.\n\nMr. Sahu said the BJP and the Trinamool have been apathetic to issues plaguing Bengal's jute belt which include a shortage of orders, rampant closure of mills, little work for labourers, and mill owners holding back gratuity of the retired workers. \"Neither of the parties has done much to develop or modernise this industry and the workers are disgruntled,\" he said.\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Ms. Chatterjee was accused by the Trinamool of doing little for the industrial development of her constituency and remaining detached from the people. The party called her a 'missing MP'. She retorted by saying the Trinamool government hindered her from solving Hooghly's problems.\n\nIn Barrackpore, for the last five years, voters saw Mr. Singh going back and forth between the two rival parties. In 2019, he ended his long association with the Trinamool and won the Barrackpore seat on a BJP ticket with a margin of around 13,000 votes. Three years later, Mr. Singh returned to the Trinamool amid the price-cap crisis in the jute industry that had led to the closure of around a dozen jute mills in Barrackpore and job losses. However, ahead of the 2024 election, he joined the BJP after being denied a ticket by the Trinamool.\n\nRead Comments",

Arjun Singh and Locket Chatterjee, the BJP candidates, were defeated by Trinamool Congress's Partha Bhowmick and Rachna Banerjee, respectively.

The jute industry, employing around 2.5 lakh workers in West Bengal, has faced issues like mill closures and lack of modernization, leading to worker dissatisfaction. Additionally, Chatterjee was criticized for her detachment from local issues, earning the label of a 'missing MP,' while Singh's frequent party-switching eroded voter trust.

        "body": "Tejashwi Yadav Takes A Jibe At PM Modi Ahead Of INDIA Bloc Meet: Modi Factor Is Finished\n\nThe Lok Sabha 2024 elections were a hardly contested battle. The world's largest democratic exercise carried on for more than a month and culminated in seven phases. The Lok Sabha Election 2024 commenced with the first polling on April 19, 2024, and concluded with the seventh round of voting on June 1, 2024.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured 291 seats, while the Congress-led INDIA bloc won 234 seats. The Congress improved its performance, winning 99 seats compared to 52 in 2019. The BJP won 240 seats.\n\nThis time, the battle was quite interesting as the behemoth BJP was looking to secure another term in the Lok Sabha, while the newly formed coalition, the I.N.D.I Alliance stood against it as a formidable opponent. While a few seats witnessed a change in leadership, some remained strongholds for their respective contenders.\n\nLet's take a look at the seats that still remained a stronghold for their respective candidates.\n\nOne of the most significant seats to consider is Varanasi, the very constituency from which Prime Minister Modi himself contested. The Kashi seat has been a strong Bastion for the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has secured victory in the Varanasi seat for the third consecutive term. Narendra Modi, the BJP candidate, contested from the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh. His opponent in the elections was the state Congress chief, Ajay Rai.\n\nVaranasi holds significance as the spiritual capital of the Hindu faith, where devotees from all over India come to cremate their deceased loved ones by the Ganges river. The campaigning in Varanasi witnessed Narendra Modi, Ajay Rai, and their supporters rallying through the streets despite the scorching sun, with afternoon temperatures soaring as high as 45 degrees. PM Modi secured victory in the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat in the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections by a margin of 1,52,513 votes. However, this victory margin has noticeably narrowed in comparison to the 2019 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nAnother such constituency that had remained a bastion for its candidate is Thiruvananthapuram. The battle in Thiruvananthapuram was riveting. The seat in the southern state of India saw a fierce battle between the incumbent three-time MP and veteran Congress politician Shashi Tharoor, who was in competition with Rajeev Chandrasekhar from the BJP, a duo that garnered much attention.\n\nAccording to data released by the Election Commission of India, the estimated voter turnout for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in the Thiruvananthapuram constituency was 66.47%. In 2019, the voter turnout in this seat was 74%, in 2014 it was 69% and in 2009 it was 66%.\n\nNow let's take a look at the constituency where the seats flipped.\n\nOne such seat is J&K's Baramulla from where the Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah was defeated by Abdul Rashid Sheikh, also known as Engineer Rashid. He secured victory by one lakh votes.\n\nRashid's victory comes as a shock as the candidate has been in Tihar Jail for the last 5 years under UAPA (Prevention of Unlawful Activities Act) charges. The election campaigns were led by his two sons since he was in prison at the time, he ran as a single candidate.\n\nThe Jammu & Kashmir region had long been a bastion for the National Conference and the PDP, but these elections showcased that the people of India in every region are always looking forward to new change\n\nThe elections this time displayed interesting dynamics and showcased an intricate interplay of electoral dynamics. The world's largest democratic exercise has finally culminated and the voting has also ended. Although the BJP has secured good numbers with the BJP falling 32 seats short of the 272-seat halfway mark in the Lok Sabha, he will need to rely on allies.",

Congress won only 2 seats.\n\nLok Sabha Election Results 2024: The Trinamool Congress (TMC) has called a meeting of all newly elected MPs of the party at around 4:00 pm on Saturday (June 8) at Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's residence in Kolkata's Kalighat. The Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) campaign strategy for Lok Sabha Polls in West Bengal failed to bring fruitful results as Trinamool Congress won 29 seats in the state.\n\nWest Bengal contributes 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 543-member Parliament. The BJPs' main focus was to dislodge Mamata Banerjee from West Bengal and even targeted the TMC government over Sandeshkhali, but the BJP won in 12 seats, down from its earlier tally of 18 seats in the 2019 polls.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday as the Lok Sabha results were announced, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee demanded resignation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that he has lost his credibility since he had said that he would cross 400 seats but could not.\n\nTMC chairperson Banerjee said, \"The Prime Minister has lost credibility, he should resign immediately because he had said that this time they would cross 400 seats. I had said that there is a doubt that the BJP would cross even 200 seats. Now they have to hold the feet of Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP.\n\nCM Mamata Banerjee added, \"Even after committing so many atrocities, spending so much money, so much arrogance of Modi ji and Amit Shah, INDIA has won and Modi has lost. He threatened everyone. In my state all leaders were threatened over the phone. All councillors and MLAs were threatened by the BJP. Many of them were offered money in 2 to 3 seats. Even after so many atrocities they have even lost in Ayodhya. So much arrogance is not good for anyone.\"\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the TMC had won 22 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state, and the BJP won 18. Congress won only 2 seats.",

The Telugu Desam Party (TDP), led by N Chandrababu Naidu, won a significant victory with 135 out of 175 seats, while its allies, Janasena Party and BJP, secured 21 and 8 seats respectively. The YSRCP was reduced to 11 seats. Governor Nazeer asked Reddy to continue as caretaker Chief Minister until the new government is established.",

The Congress, on the other hand, registered a strong growth, winning 99 seats compared to 52 that it had won in 2019 and 44 seats in 2014.

        "body": "Get latest articles and stories on India at LatestLY. The world experienced the warmest May ever, with record heat, rain and floods wreaking havoc in many countries, according to new data released on Wednesday.\n\nNew Delhi, Jun 5 (PTI) The world experienced the warmest May ever, with record heat, rain and floods wreaking havoc in many countries, according to new data released on Wednesday.\n\nIt was also the 12 consecutive month of record-high temperatures, a result of the combined effect of now weakening El Nino and human-caused climate change, the European Union's climate agency Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said.\n\nAlso Read | AP EAMCET Results 2024: Examination Results of EAPCET To Be Announced Soon at cets.apsche.ap.gov.in, Know Steps To Check Rank Cards.\n\nThe update from Copernicus coincided with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) prediction that there is an 80 per cent chance that one of the next five years will be at least 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than it was at the start of the industrial age.\n\nIt also said there is an 86 per cent chance that at least one of these years will set a new temperature record, beating 2023 which is currently the warmest year.\n\nAlso Read | Lok Sabha Election Results 2024: Major Castes Like Jats, Rajputs, Meenas and Gurjars Boycotted BJP in Rajasthan, Leading to Loss of 11 Seats.\n\nThe global average temperature for May 2024 was 1.52 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average, marking the 11th consecutive month (since July 2023) at or above 1.5 degrees Celsius, Copernicus said.\n\nA permanent breach of the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit specified in the Paris Agreement, however, refers to long-term warming over many years.\n\nThe European climate agency said the global average temperature for the last 12 months (June 2023-May 2024) is the highest on record, at 0.75 degree Celsius above the 1991-2020 average and 1.63 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average.\n\nCarlo Buontempo, C3S Director, said: \"It is shocking but not surprising that we have reached this 12-month streak. While this sequence of record-breaking months will eventually be interrupted, the overall signature of climate change remains and there is no sign in sight of a change in such a trend.\"\n\n\"We are living in unprecedented times, but we also have unprecedented skill in monitoring the climate and this can help inform our actions. This string of hottest months will be remembered as comparatively cold but if we manage to stabilise the concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere in the very near future we might be able to return to these 'cold' temperatures by the end of the century,\" he said.\n\nAccording to climate scientists, countries need to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nEarth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.15 degrees Celsius compared to the average in 1850-1900 due to the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases -- primarily carbon dioxide and methane -- in the atmosphere.\n\nThis warming is considered the reason behind record droughts, wildfires, and floods worldwide.\n\nAccording to a recent study by scientists at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, climate impacts could cost the global economy around USD 38 trillion a year by 2049, with countries least responsible for the problem and having minimum resources to adapt to impacts suffering the most.\n\nGlobally, 2023 was the warmest year in the 174-year observational record, with the global average temperature at 1.45 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial baseline (1850-1900).\n\nThe warming may set a new record in 2024 as scientists say El Nino -- periodic warming of the ocean surface in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean -- typically has the greatest impact on global climate in the second year of its development.\n\nThe world is witnessing weather extremes under a combined effect of the 2023-24 El Nino and human-caused climate change.\n\nAmid a brutal heat wave, India recorded nearly 25,000 suspected heat stroke cases and 56 deaths due to heat-related illnesses from March to May, PTI reported last week, citing data from the health ministry.\n\nHowever, the data does not include deaths from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Delhi, and the final numbers are expected to be higher, a source said.\n\nGlobal weather agencies, including the India Meteorological Department, are expecting La Nina conditions by August-September.\n\nWhile El Nino conditions are associated with weaker monsoon winds and drier conditions in India. La Nina conditions -- the antithesis of El Nino -- lead to plentiful rainfall during the monsoon season.",

Climate scientists emphasize the need to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid severe climate impacts. The warming has already led to extreme weather events, including droughts, wildfires, and floods. In India, nearly 25,000 heat stroke cases and 56 deaths were reported from March to May. The global economy could face significant costs due to climate impacts, particularly affecting countries with fewer resources to adapt.",

We do not have any such information. Nitish Kumar is a very sensible man and he has a huge popularity in Bihar. He is a steady politician. People like us who do politics with him also have great trust in him, so it is not right to make such comments.\"\n\nRajiv Pratap Rudy defeated Rohini Acharya of RJD by 13661 votes in the Saran Lok Sabha constituency.\n\nEarlier a picture went viral when Nitish Kumar and his former INDIA ally and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav were seen flying in the same plane to Delhi.\n\nNitish Kumar has affirmed their support for the NDA government.\n\nHowever, speculations are continuing that the INDIA bloc is trying to woo some of the NDA allies to spring a surprise.\n\nThe counting of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections was held on Tuesday. According to the Election Commission of India, the BJP won 240 seats, much lower than its 2019 tally of 303. The Congress, on the other hand, registered a strong improvement, winning 99 seats. The INDIA bloc crossed the 230 mark, posing stiff competition, and defying all predictions.\n\nIn Bihar, the BJP-led NDA delivered a fine performance, winning 29 out of the 40 seats. BJP and JDU won 12 seats each, while LJP (Ram Vilas) won all the five seats it contested. The RJD and Congress won four and three seats, respectively. (ANI)",

        "summary": "Rajiv Pratap Rudy of the BJP expressed gratitude to the people of Chhapra for electing him for the third consecutive time from the Saran Lok Sabha constituency. He defeated RJD's Rohini Acharya by 13,661 votes. Rudy dismissed speculations about Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar joining the INDIA bloc, praising Kumar's political acumen and popularity. Despite rumors, Kumar has affirmed support for the NDA government. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 240 seats, a decrease from 2019, while Congress improved to 99 seats. The INDIA bloc posed strong competition with over 230 seats. In Bihar, the BJP-led NDA won 29 out of 40 seats, with BJP and JDU each securing 12 seats, and LJP (Ram Vilas) winning five. The RJD and Congress won four and three seats, respectively.",

        "body": "Bookmark stories for easy access on any device or the Swarajya app.\n\nThe recent definitive electoral triumph, securing a third consecutive term, for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) headed by the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) carries both the sweetness of victory and the bitterness of falling short of an outright majority for the BJP.\n\nHowever, this sweet-bitter win serves as a timely caution for the Hindutva party to strive for an absolute majority in the next general elections of 2029.\n\nThe path ahead is formidable, but this setback may well have paved the roadmap for the saffron party to achieve its most significant fourth consecutive victory in the next elections to Indian Parliament.\n\nIt is always easy to criticize in hindsight. From candidate selection to complacency, one can now cite a thousand one faults in the campaign.\n\nThe recent election results have proven that the Indian National Congress (INC) was completely wrong in questioning the reliability of Electronic Voting Machines (EVM). They knowingly spread false information and created doubts in the minds of the public. It would be great if the Supreme Court takes notice of this behaviour by the opposition alliance and holds them accountable. They should apologize not only to the Election Commission but also to the citizens of India.\n\nThe election results have also shattered the false notion that Indians in the north blindly vote for the BJP based on communal sentiments, while those in the south, being 'secular and enlightened', vote against it.\n\nThis divisive narrative shamelessly propagated by the INDI alliance with its racist undertones, is a re-employment of a dangerous ploy which was a colonial fabrication.\n\nThe truth is that Indian voters, regardless of their region, vote with reason and caution. They make informed choices, considering the welfare of the nation above all else.\n\nIn 2019, the BJP won because they effectively showcased the welfare schemes that benefited people from all walks of life. With corruption almost eliminated, the efficiency of the schemes reaching its beneficiaries was phenomenal.\n\nThe beneficiaries of these schemes became a strong support base for the BJP, contributing to their victory. Narendra Modi skilfully combined this new support base with a civilizational vision of Hindutva. It was a brilliant move, where the ideals of Ram and progress were integrated for the common Indian.\n\nThis vision and strategy draw their inspiration from Gandhi and Deendayal Upadhyaya. While some may consider such idealism in action quixotic, Modi proved that it can lead to significant political advantage.\n\nIn 2024, the Modi government faced the most challenging election in the history of any democracy. The magnitude and diversity of India made it even more difficult. The nation was devastated by a pandemic, causing immense loss of lives and livelihoods. Despite the government's efficient response, there were inevitable shortcomings that took a toll on the people. These alone could have generated significant anti-incumbency.\n\nHowever, against all odds, Modi's BJP not only survived but also emerged victorious in the five state elections. The local factors played a crucial role in this remarkable achievement.\n\nBut opposition was not idle.\n\nIn 2019, the opposition made a lot of noise about a fake scandal in the Rafale deal. It failed to gain traction. On the other hand, the Modi government showed the common man what they had achieved. The impact was felt, especially by women.\n\nAs 2024 approached, the opposition changed their strategy. They stopped alleging high-decibel scandals and instead outsourced the 'dirty work'. Attacks similar to the Hindenburg Report and the Pegasus controversy emerged, all originating from outside India.\n\nMeanwhile, within the country, they launched a massive mass contact program to address the real and perceived issues faced by the common man, such as unemployment and rising prices.\n\nWhile security concerns and genuine threats to life, limited the Prime Minister's direct interaction with the masses, Rahul Gandhi took on a 'Yatra' where carefully orchestrated images of him connecting with people were widely shared through the media. With the widespread use of cell phones across society, the Congress IT cell efficiently disseminated these images and videos, transforming the perception of Rahul Gandhi.\n\nHe was now viewed as a charismatic leader rather than a privileged dynast. When I discussed this with influential BJP sympathizers before the elections, they dismissed it without consideration. It never pays to underestimate one's enemy.\n\nThen the ED raids happened which increasingly became a mockery. But important cases like the 2G spectrum scandal were not pursued with the same speed and publicity. The frequent raids on opposition politicians appeared trivial and motivated. The 'Mood of the Nation' survey conducted by India Today revealed that even BJP sympathizers viewed these raids as politically driven.\n\nAnother concerning trend was the increasing number of people believing the opposition's allegations of government favouritism towards certain corporates. These were not positive signs, yet they were seemingly ignored.\n\nIn summary, while the opposition remained stagnant between 2014 and 2019, Modi's BJP adapted its strategies effectively. However, between 2019 and 2024, this dynamic appears to have reversed.\n\nBut all these were about poll strategies and lapses; what should be worrying to any Hindutvaite is not all of the above.\n\nThe Indian National Congress (INC) under the dynasty has been progressively embracing all the 'spilt-Hindu society' forces.\n\nIn the 1990s these forces used the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) of Kanshiram. But the brilliant vision of social harmony and justice put forth by that strategist Govindacharya (and it is said, aided by veteran journalist M.V.Kamath) had Kumari Mayawati's BSP understand the inclusive nature of Hindutva.\n\nTheir slogans and approaches changed positively towards society. Unfortunately that vision seems to have been destroyed now by the dynasty.\n\nAgain it is the question of adaptation. The saffronists seemed to have lapsed into complacency.\n\nThe simple fact is that the political Hindu is still an effervescent entity and where sustained, political Hindu is a minority. Just as how expansionist religionists as true secularists are effervescent.\n\nSo Hindus get divided into caste lines. The caste line divides are secular fault lines in the true sense of the term. It is about economic opportunities, social mobility, higher share of resources from land to bureaucratic power etc.\n\nA further twist comes when Rahul Gandhi and his political advisers like Kancha Ilaiah and Jairam Ramesh try to peddle a causal connection between the problems in these domains with Hindu religion. The BJP failed squarely to address this deepening faultline. Not because they could not. But because they thought they had already secured that front. They have not.\n\nIn order to establish a politically conscious Hindu majority, it is essential to go beyond mere rhetorical Hindutva. What is needed is a sustained and profound Hindutva that advocates social justice and harmony. This includes ensuring that all communities have equal access to education, livelihood opportunities, and positions of influence.\n\nHindu spiritual leadership should strive to democratise the presence of Saraswati (knowledge), Lakshmi (wealth), and Shakti (power) throughout all segments of society.\n\nHindu spiritual teachers, especially those perceived as traditional, bear a significant duty in this respect. They should spread the spiritual principles of liberty, fraternity and equality enshrined in Sanatana Dharma through its sacred Puranic historiography.\n\nTheir role extends to advocating for women's empowerment and condemning practices like untouchability. Additionally, they must remind the so-called upper castes of their responsibility to rectify social exclusion, not merely as a strategic move but more so because it aligns with Dharma.\n\nRather than opposing intercaste relationships, they should either support them as Dharmic or if they cannot bring themselves to do it, should remain silent. Ultimately, purifying Dharma from socially stagnant elements like caste and untouchability is crucial. Failing to do so could jeopardize the survivale of Hindus as a whole\n\nForget the BJP.\n\nIt is time for every Hindu to introspect as to how the person who was the divine instrument in building the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya had to struggle to win in UP while the successor to the leader who ordered firing on Ram bhaktas in Ayodya is today gloating in glee? Then compare this to the strategic voting by expansionist religionists.\n\nEvery politically-aware Hindu will then understand the precarious situation we are in, in terms of survival and civilizational terms.\n\nA holistic Hindu consolidation is far beyond the strategic concerns of just the BJP.",

        "body": "The border districts - like Malda, Murshidabad, among others - are among the few areas in the country where the minority population is in majority.\n\nThe last Census of India conducted in 2011 records Muslims constituting over 51% of the undivided Malda district's population of about 40 lakhs. Unofficial estimates now put that number at around 69%.\n\nThe polarisation is such that despite the demography, in one of the two Lok Sabha constituencies in this district (Maldaha Uttar), the BJP candidate has won the seat twice in a row, including in 2024. The split of the minority votes between the TMC and Congress, who fielded a Muslim candidate, also came to Khagen Murmu's aid this time. The other seat here (Maldaha Dakshin) saw Isha Khan Choudhury of the Congress register his party's lone win in the state.\n\nBut TMC had better luck elsewhere.\n\nTo Malda's south lies the district of Murshidabad where the last Census recorded Muslims comprising 66.27% of its population of over 71 lakh people in 2011. Estimates put Muslim population in the former at a formidable 72%. Here the TMC candidate Abu Taher Khan bested CPM stalwart Mohammed Salim.\n\nDidi's government has several schemes for minorities which include honorarium to the imam and muezzin, funds meant for the establishment of hostels and for stipend to poor and meritorious students of the minority community. The outreach paid dividends in 2024.\n\nThough Muslim electors, most of whom are from adjoining Bangladesh, do not repose their faith in a non-Bengali minority candidate, Yusuf Pathan proved to be a rare example in 2024.\n\nIn fact, he turned into a giant slayer. The cricketer-turned-politician, who challenged Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on his home turf of Baharampur (in Murshidabad district), won convincingly with a margin of over 85,000 votes despite being a greenhorn.\n\nPathan, from Gujarat, got the support of minorities, purportedly since he represented the TMC. His sporting background added to the final score.\n\nThe TMC outsiders who won\n\nPathan wasn't the only \"outsider\" from the party to win.\n\nFilm star Shatrughan Sinha and cricketer Kirti Azad, who are from the adjacent state of Bihar, were leaders of the BJP and then Congress. While the former lost from Patna Sahib (Bihar) in 2019 on a Congress ticket in 2019 and subsequently joined TMC, Azad lost from Dhanbad (Jharkhand), again as a Congress candidate.\n\nSinha was reinstated in the TMC and won the Asansol seat in a bye-election and he retained it in 2024, while Azad found victory this time in Bardhaman-Durgapur Parliamentary seat.\n\nThese three candidates were propped up by the TMC despite party leaders having coined the term \"bhariagata\" which means an outsider. For BJP, a party just evolving in West Bengal, there was no other option than finding leaders from other states to camp in the state or poach others as candidates. Thus, the TMC, which itself is a breakaway from the Congress, raised this slogan to fight their rivals.",

        "summary": "In the recent elections, Mamata Banerjee's TMC (Trinamool Congress) defied predictions and solidified its dominance in West Bengal, particularly in the border districts with significant Muslim populations. In Malda, despite a split in minority votes aiding BJP's Khagen Murmu in Maldaha Uttar, TMC found success in Murshidabad where Abu Taher Khan defeated CPM's Mohammed Salim. TMC's outreach programs for minorities, including stipends and honorariums, proved effective.\n\nNotably, cricketer-turned-politician Yusuf Pathan, an outsider from Gujarat, won in Baharampur, defeating Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. Other TMC outsiders, like film star Shatrughan Sinha and cricketer Kirti Azad, also secured victories in Asansol and Bardhaman-Durgapur, respectively. Despite TMC's criticism of BJP's use of \"outsiders,\" the party successfully leveraged high-profile candidates to maintain its stronghold in the state.",

        "body": "With the NDA moving swiftly to form government at the centre on Wednesday, the INDIA bloc, far short of majority numbers in Lok Sabha, has decided to sit in opposition and wait for \"appropriate time\" to take \"appropriate steps\" to \"realise the people's desire not to be ruled by the BJP's government\".\n\nThe Congress led-INDIA bloc, however, believes that the BJP-lead NDA alliance is fragile given the past track record of its two crucial partners -- Janata Dal United (JDU) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP), said a coalition party source. Over a period of time, both the parties have sided with different political coalitions to suit their immediate interests. Among the two, JDU supremo Nitish Kumar is infamous for his his several u-turns in his political career to remain Bihar Chief Minister.\n\nAfter two-hour meeting at his residence, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge read out a joint statement, \"...The INDIA bloc will continue will fight against the fascist rule of the BJP led by PM Modi. We will take the appropriate steps at the appropriate time to realise the people's desire not to be ruled by the BJP's govt...\"\n\nINDIA block also said, \"The people's mandate has given a befitting reply to the BJP and their politics of hate, corruption and deprivation. This is a political and moral defeat of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\".\n\nReiterating what Congress leaders especially Rahul Gandhi has been saying through out the election campaign, the joint statement observed, \"This is a mandate in defense of the Constitution of India and against price rise, unemployment and crony capitalism of the Modi Government.\"\n\nThe constituents of the India bloc also thanked the people of India for the overwhelming support received from the people across the country.\n\nThe opposition INDIA bloc, an alliance of around 27 parties, won a total of 232 seats in the Lok Sabha elections. While the Congress managed 99 seats, the SP emerged victorious on 37 seats from just 5 constituencies it won in Uttar Pradesh in 2019 polls. Likewise, the TMC improved its last time's tally to corner 29 seats in West Bengal, and the DMK got 22 seats. In Maharashtra, the Sharad Pawar faction of the NCP got 8 seats and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena won 9 seats. In Bihar, the RJD trounced opposition in 4 constituencies, while CPI(M) also cornered four seats in different states and the AAP and JMM managed to win 3 each respectively.\n\nAlmost all 27 INDIA bloc leaders were present at the meeting held at Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge's residence. Those included Congress leaders present were Sonia Gandhi, her son Rahul and daughter Priyanka Gandhi, and KC Venugopal; DMK chief and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin; Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Ram Goal Yadav from Samajwadi Party; RJD's Tejaswi Yadav; JMM leaders Champai Soren and Kalpana Soren; former Union Minister Sharad Pawar and his daughter Supriya Sule from the NCP Sharad Pawar faction; AAP' Sanjay Singh and Raghav Chadha, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury.\n\nIt's was a pre-decided meeting to take stock of the elections and INDIA's performance and how to move ahead.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on June 5, 2024",

Following this decision, PM Modi took to X, formerly Twitter, to assure 140 crore people of India that the alliance will work towards building a Viksit Bharat.\n\n\"Met our valued NDA partners. Ours is an alliance that will further national progress and fulfil regional aspirations. We will serve the 140 crore people of India and work towards building a Viksit Bharat,\" the PM wrote.\n\nAlso read: Lok Sabha Election 2024 results explained: How marginal drop in BJP vote share led to massive dent in tally\n\nNDA MPs will meet on June 7 to formally elect Modi as their leader, after which the alliance leaders will go to the President to submit their letters of support, said HAM (Secular) leader and former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi following a recent meeting.\n\nSources indicate that the new government may be sworn in over the weekend, with efforts being made to finalize formalities quickly to prevent any uncertainty, which could be exploited by a buoyant opposition.\n\nThe timing of the swearing-in could also depend on how soon the BJP and its allies reach agreements on matters such as the distribution of ministries and other negotiation terms. Alternatively, these issues might be deferred for resolution at a later stage.\n\nAmong the 21 leaders from 16 parties attending the meeting were TDP leader N Chandrababu Naidu, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, LJP(R) leader Chirag Paswan, JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy, Jana Sena's Pawan Kalyan, AGP's Atul Bora, and NCP's Praful Patel, along with Modi, and BJP leaders Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, and J P Nadda.\n\nJanata Dal (United) leader Sanjay Jha, present at the meeting, stated that the formalities for forming the government under Modi are expected to conclude soon. He added that all parties expressed confidence in Modi's leadership.\n\nA resolution passed at the meeting affirmed that the NDA government will continue to work towards improving living standards and ensuring the country's all-round development while preserving its heritage.\n\n\"We are all proud that the NDA fought the 2024 Lok Sabha polls unitedly under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and won. We all NDA leaders unanimously elect Narendra Modi as our leader,\" it added.\n\nIt also highlighted that people have witnessed development in every sector over the last 10 years due to the NDA government's pro-people policies under Modi.\n\nThe NDA has won 293 seats in the Lok Sabha election, comfortably surpassing the majority mark of 272 in the 543-member House, paving the way for Modi to take the oath for a third consecutive term, a first for any ruling alliance since 1962.\n\nHowever, this time will be different for Modi as the BJP has fallen short of a majority and now depends on allies for government formation, after having enjoyed a comfortable majority in the previous two terms.\n\nAlso read: Lok Sabha Election 2024 results: Here's a look at full list of winners from all 543 seats\n\nAt the meeting, the BJP showcased a collective partnership with its allies. Naidu, Kumar, and Shinde sat to Modi's left, while Nadda, Singh, and Shah flanked him on the right. In terms of party strength, Naidu, Kumar, and Shinde lead the largest NDA constituents after the BJP.\n\nNaidu and Kumar, commanding the support of 28 MPs together, dismissed speculation about their future moves. Naidu reaffirmed his support for the BJP, a sentiment echoed by JD(U)'s Jha. When asked by a reporter if he is in the NDA, Naidu responded, \"We contested the elections together. Why do you doubt?\"\n\nAll leaders congratulated Modi for his leadership and the nation's progress under his tenure, appreciating his hard work and efforts in nation-building.\n\nModi remarked that the historic mandate for the NDA's third consecutive government had not been seen in over 60 years. His allies commended his clear vision for a \"Viksit Bharat\" and asserted their partnership in achieving this goal. They also praised Modi for enhancing India's global stature and his efforts towards poverty eradication, pledging to continue the good work.",

Addressing a press conference after the meeting, Kharge said, \"The constituents of the INDIA bloc thank the people of India for the overwhelming support received by our alliance. The people's mandate has given a befitting reply to the BJP and their politics of hate and corruption. This is a mandate in defence of the Constitution of India and against price rise, unemployment and crony capitalism and also to save democracy. The INDIA bloc will continue to fight against the fascist rule of the BJP led by Modi.\"\n\n\"We will take appropriate steps at the appropriate time to realise the people's desire not to be ruled by BJP's government. This is our decision and we altogether agreed on these points and we will keep up with the promises we have made to the people,\" Kharge said.

The meeting was held at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's residence here on Wednesday.\n\nIn today's NDA meet, with the support of Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu, the NDA has secured majority and will soon stake claim to form the government at the Centre.

The people's mandate has given a befitting reply to the BJP and their politics of hate and corruption. This is a mandate in defence of the Constitution of India and against price rise, unemployment and crony capitalism and also to save democracy. The INDIA bloc will continue to fight against the fascist rule of the BJP led by Modi.\"\n\n\"We will take appropriate steps at the appropriate time to realise the people's desire not to be ruled by BJP's government. This is our decision and we altogether agreed on these points and we will keep up with the promises we have made to the people,\" Kharge said.\n\nSeveral INDIA bloc leaders took part in the INDIA bloc meeting held at the Congress President's house.\n\nCongress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, Congress leader KC Venugopal; Kalpana Soren, JMM MLA and wife of former Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren; Revolutionary Socialist Party leader NK Premachandran.\n\nAAP MP Raghav Chaddha, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, NCP (SCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Supriya Sule, Dipankar Bhattacharya and Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin were among the leaders who took part in the meeting.\n\nShiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said, \"We have decided that this mandate is against increasing fascism and against those destroying the Constitution. At the right time, we will move forward towards fulfilling people's desire to change the government.\"\n\nPK Kunhalikutty, National General Secretary of Indian Union Muslim League said that they (BJP) don't have a comfortable majority and the INDIA bloc will wait for the appropriate time.\n\nER Eswaran, General Secretary, Kongunadu Makkal Desia Katchi said, \"The mandate is clearly for the INDIA bloc. But the situation is not conducive and numbers are not with us.\"\n\nDipankar Bhattacharya, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation says, \"It was a fruitful meeting. We adopted a resolution thanking people for supporting our election campaign and that the mandate is squarely against the BJP govt.\"\n\nAccording to the Election Commission of India, the BJP won 240 seats, much lower than its 2019 tally of 303. The Congress, on the other hand, registered a strong improvement, winning 99 seats. While the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance won 292 seats, the INDIA bloc crossed the 230 mark, posing stiff competition, and defying all predictions.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has secured a third term, but the BJP needed the support of other parties in his coalition, primarily JD (U) chief Nitish Kumar and TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu.\n\nOn the other hand, NDA leaders unanimously passed a resolution in the meeting, electing Narendra Modi as their leader.\n\nThe meeting was held at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's residence here on Wednesday.\n\nIn today's NDA meet, with the support of Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu, the NDA has secured majority and will soon stake claim to form the government at the Centre.\n\nDuring the meeting, the NDA leaders congratulated the Prime Minister for his leadership and the strides made by the nation under him in the last 10 years.\n\nThe NDA leaders will meet President Droupadi Murmu after a meeting with the newly elected members of the Lok Sabha scheduled for June 7. The sources added that Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah, and Nadda will hold a meeting with the allies to discuss government formation.\n\nPM Modi will take the oath for the third time on June 8, sources said.\n\nPresident Droupadi Murmu dissolved the 17th Lok Sabha on Wednesday after the recommendation of the Union Cabinet.\n\n\"The President accepted the advice of the Cabinet on June 5, 2024, and signed the Order dissolving the 17th Lok Sabha in the exercise of the powers conferred upon her by Sub-Clause (2) of Article 85 of the Constitution,\" a statement issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan said on Wednesday.

        "body": "Kedar Jadhav Announces Retirement: Here's Look At Former CSK Star's Movie-Like Love Story With Wife Snehal Jadhav - In Pics\n\nLok Sabha Election Results 2024: The mandate 2024 is fractured if seen through the lens of a single party. The BJP is the largest single party with 240 seats, the Congress second with 99 seats and the Samajwadi Party third with 37 seats. While the NDA has 292 seats, the INDIA bloc has 234 seats. There are 17 MPs including smaller parties and independents. The Congress has maintained that the verdict is against the BJP. Addressing the media after the INDIA bloc meeting, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge hinted that the opposition will take suitable steps to oust the BJP from power.\n\n\"The INDIA bloc will continue will fight against the fascist rule of the BJP led by PM Modi. We will take the appropriate steps at the appropriate time to realise the people's desire not to be ruled by the BJP's government,\" said Kharge, hinting that doors will remain open for NDA allies to join Congress.\n\nShiv Sena-UBT leader Sanjay Raut said that the INDIA bloc will try to form a government after six months. He said that the consensus among the NDA parties won't last long. As the BJP and the Congress work to keep their flocks together ahead of the government formation, you can check the number game here:\n\nIf the Telugu Desham Party (TDP) decides to quit the BJP, then the NDA will have 292-16 = 276 which is four more than the majority mark of 272. However, if only Nitish Kumar's JDU leaves the NDA, then the Modi government will have 292-12=280 seats, eight more than the majority mark. However, if both the TDP and the JDU leave the NDA, then the BJP-led government will collapse as it will only have 292-(16+12)=264 seats, eight less than the majority mark.\n\nThe INDIA bloc currently has 234 seats. If the TDP and the JDU both join the INDI Alliance, then they will have 234+28=262, still eight short of the majority mark. The Congress will then have to depend on seven independents or 11 smaller regional parties holding one seat each.",

        "body": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's narrower election victory is unlikely to immediately lead to a change in government policy stance towards more populism, Kotak Alternate Asset Managers has said.\n\n\"In our view, it is too early to assume that the weaker mandate will lead to a change in policy stance, or that the government will resort to populist measures,\" Jitendra Gohil, Chief Investment Strategist, Kotak Alternate Asset Managers, said in a note to investors post the general election results.\n\n\"We expect the new government will continue to focus on making India a more stable investment destination.\n\n\"In fact, central government capital expenditure seems to be peaking, and the robust revenue collection could naturally be directed to boost savings in the coming years,\" he added.\n\nPolicies promoting financial inclusion, Make in India, export growth, defence modernisation, Ayushman Bharat, and reasonably high capex spending, as well as business friendly policies, are likely to continue, according to Kotak Alternate Asset Managers.\n\nAll eyes are now on the union budget to be presented in July to see if the new government would use the \u20b92.1-lakh crore dividend bounty it recently received from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) towards fiscal consolidation or for ramping up its social welfare scheme spends.\n\nThe 2024 general election results on Tuesday stunned political observers and large section of BJP supporters who were anticipating Modi led party to win a supermajority. According to the final tally, the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) ended up with 240 seats, falling short of magical 272 mark that would have ensured single-party majority for it in Lok Sabha.\n\nBJP with the support of its pre-election allies is now set to stake a claim for forming the new government at the Centre.\n\nMeanwhile, Gohil said that the perception that India needs a strong majority government to pursue economic reforms isn't entirely accurate. The earlier coalition governments had also enacted difficult economic reforms in the past, he noted.\n\nImpact on financial markets\n\nAs regards impact of election results on financial markets, Gohil said that he expects further correction in the equity markets, with a rotation towards defensive.\n\nPharma, FMCG and IT could see outperformance in the near-term.\n\n\"We also like private banks post this correction and believe they are well positioned. PSUs and defence sector can see further correction before stabilisation,\" he said.\n\nOn fixed income markets, Kotak Alternate Asset Managers recommend adding duration to portfolios opportunistically.\n\n\"We believe India's macro fundamentals will remain strong, and the focus will continue to be on financial stability. Hence, we expect yields to head lower, albeit slower than earlier anticipated,\" he said.\n\nRupee likely to be volatile\n\nOn rupee, Gohil noted that INR could experience near-term volatility, but may depreciate at a slower rate than the historical average of around 4 percent.\n\n\"Weaker dollar fundamentals against India's improved fundamentals may lead to a depreciation of around 2 percent per year in the medium term,\" Gohil said.\n\nKotak Alternate Asset Managers continue to maintain its positive view on gold due to heightened geopolitical tensions and weakening dollar fundamentals.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on June 5, 2024",

The U.S. looks forward to advancing our partnership with the Indian government and commends the estimated 650 million voters who exercised their right to vote.\"\n\nThe US State Department in an official statement also congratulated PM Modi and the NDA alliance on their victory in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and said they look forward to continuing to further the bilateral partnership, including to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Mathew Miller said: \"With approximately 650 million voters casting their ballots over the past six weeks, these elections represent the largest exercise in democracy in human history. We commend Indian voters, poll workers, civil society, and journalists for their commitment and vital contributions to India's democratic processes and institutions.\"\n\n\"We look forward to continuing to further our partnership with the Indian government to promote prosperity and innovation, address the climate crisis, and ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region,\" the statement said.\n\nThe congratulatory messages and statement came after the BJP-led NDA alliance unanimously elected Modi as head of the alliance, which notched up the numbers to form the government at the centre. PM Modi will be heading the government for the third successive term, though with a reduced majority for his BJP party, which will be depending on the votes of crucial regional allies to stay afloat.\n\nUNI RN",

        "title": "As Chandrababu Naidu emerges kingmaker, this 10-year-old video becomes talking point",
        "body": "TDP wins 16 Lok Sabha seats, performs well in Assembly elections\n\nYou may likely have already seen this video. It must have popped up on your social media feed or WhatsApp groups after the 2024 Lok Sabha results where people shared it in jest. It shows the Telugu Desam Party's (TDP) N Chandrababu Naidu sharing a stage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an election rally. As Naidu attempts to sit behind Modi, the latter grabs his hand and forces him to sit by his side.\n\nThis decade-old video went viral after the Bharatiya Janata Party failed to secure a clear majority on its own. It now banks on allies like Naidu and Nitish Kumar to usher in Modi 3.0. Modi making Naidu sit beside him is obviously spot-on as an allegory for the National Democratic Alliance's current state.\n\nBut the story behind this video is just as interesting.\n\nThis was 2014. Narendra Modi was campaigning hard for his first prime ministerial bid. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance was massively unpopular by then with several high-profile corruption allegations. Modi had pitched himself as a saviour, who would take India to another golden age.\n\nAround the same time, Naidu's star was in fall. The TDP was out of power. He also saw the inside of a prison. His party workers were demoralised. Naidu also suffered because initially, his party's stance regarding the division of Andhra Pradesh was confusing. As a result, before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when the state was set to be split, Naidu's party seemed to have been marginalised in both Andhra Pradesh and the Telangana region. Assembly polls were also scheduled to take place in both states along with the general elections.\n\nIn these trying times, when the BJP offered to ally with the party, Naidu readily accepted the offer, having sensed the winds of change. Despite having little presence in these states, the BJP managed to get its desired Lok Sabha and Assembly seats from TDP.\n\nChandrababu Naidu, under a lot of pressure at the time, was forced to take a back seat to the BJP.\n\nDespite the electoral alliance, Naidu was not invited to every NDA rally in the state, where the real star, of course, was Modi. But the two finally shared a stage on April 22, 2014, in present-day Telangana's Mahbubnagar. And it was here that the events of the viral video transpired. Modi pulled Naidu by the arm and made him sit next to him because he knew that even a perception of differences between the two allies could cost him.\n\nThis move, to make Naidu sit beside him, worked like a charm. Modi became the Prime Minister and Chandrababu once again became the Chief Minister after winning the assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nWho would have thought then that this ten-year-old video would be so apt for today's political situation? Who would have thought that Chandrababu Naidu, a kingmaker for the United Front in 1996, would emerge as a kingmaker once again? Who would have thought that pulling Naidu to his side would become not just a gesture of goodwill, but imperative for Modi in 2024?\n\nThe TDP scored 16 seats in the Lok Sabha elections. And the party performed spectacularly in the simultaneous Assembly polls. Chandrababu Naidu, who is set to be Andhra Pradesh's CM once again, does not need the BJP. But the saffron party needs him for its third term. While Naidu has made it clear that he is with Modi, there is a lot of speculation on the pound of flesh he will exact.\n\nIn some ways, Chandrababu Naidu and Narendra Modi function very similarly. Like Modi, Naidu likes to keep a vice-like grip on his party. In 1999, despite having 29 MPs, he chose to support the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government from the outside and did not accept the offer to be a part of the government and have his ministers in the cabinet. He was afraid that once his MPs became cosy as Union ministers, they'd be vulnerable to getting poached. However, whenever he visited Delhi, he would come with a demand for a hefty package for his state.\n\nNaidu is a leader who knows that it's better to bypass some battles to win the war. He has often resisted the temptation for short-lived thrills. For example, during the United Front government (1996 to 1998), he played the pivotal role of managing the coalition of 13 parties as the convener. But he never threw his hat into the ring to become the prime minister. He let the top post go first to HD Deve Gowda, and then to IK Gujral. Instinct warned him that the coalition government would not last for a term -- and it didn't.\n\nDuring Narendra Modi's prime ministerial regime, Naidu's camaraderie with the BJP lasted only for four years. In 2018, Naidu blamed the Modi government for ignoring the aspirations of Andhra Pradesh's people, when he failed to secure Special Status for the state. He decided to break away from the NDA and made his two ministers resign.\n\nThe only solace that the BJP has this time is that Naidu swept the Andhra Assembly, bagging 135 seats out of a total of 175. He will prefer enjoying the clout and comfort of being the chief minister in his home state over meddling too much in national politics. However, the BJP should be very wary of his hard bargain. After all, Naidu gobbled up his father-in-law NT Rama Rao's party so swiftly, that his opponents within the party were too stunned to react.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the resurgence of N Chandrababu Naidu, leader of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), as a significant political figure following the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. A decade-old video of Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has gone viral, symbolizing the current political dynamics where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) needs allies like Naidu to form a government. In 2014, Naidu allied with the BJP during a challenging period for his party, which helped both leaders secure key political positions. In the recent elections, TDP won 16 Lok Sabha seats and performed well in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections, positioning Naidu as a potential kingmaker. Despite past tensions, Naidu has expressed support for Modi, but speculation remains about the demands he might make in return. The article highlights Naidu's strategic political maneuvers and his history of leveraging alliances for regional benefits.",

He has said that this election will be a referendum for our 100 days of ruling. The public has given 50 per cent of the seats to Bharatiya Janata Pary. Are you not feeling ashamed?\" Rao said.\n\nThe BJP has won eight seats in Telangana, the Congress eight and the AIMIM won one seat in the recently held Lok Sabha elections who results were declared on Tuesday.

        "title": "How China, Pakistan, US media interpreted election results might surprise you",
        "body": "Most news outlets focused on how the victory came without a landslide mandate\n\nOn June 4, the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was voted back to power for a third straight term. This day highlighted the beauty of Indian democracy. While the NDA, having secured 293 seats, is set to form the government, it faced a tough fight from the opposition, which won 232 seats. Neither the exit polls nor the political pundits expected such a surge in opposition numbers. The international media also looked with surprise and reported on the elections of the world's largest democracy.\n\nFrom the New York Times in the US to the Malaysian daily The Star, most news outlets highlighted how PM Modi was voted back to power but with a lower victory margin. Pakistani daily Dawn interpreted it in terms of the minority population.\n\nChina's Global Times saw the lesser number of seats for the BJP as a constraint for Prime Minister Modi, saying his \"ambition to compete with Chinese manufacturing and improve India's business environment will be difficult to accomplish\".\n\n1. Needing help, says The New York Times\n\n'Needing Help to Stay in Power, Modi Loses His Aura of Invincibility,' was The New York Times headline for the news report on the Lok Sabha election result.\n\nThe US media outlet wrote how though Modi would form the government, the election was a neck-to-neck battle between the BJP and the opposition, and how he will now have to rely on support from his coalition partners.\n\n\"And India, while extending Mr. Modi's firm hold on power, learnt that there are limits to his political potency, even as he made the election, usually fought seat by seat, squarely about himself,\" it analysed.\n\n2. The Times, London, goes out with a guess\n\nThe London-based The Times newspaper guessed that \"India's poorest voters stopped the prime minister's Bharatiya Janata Party from winning outright, forcing him to rely on support from the National Democratic Alliance.\"\n\nThere is no data backing the claim that it was exactly the poor that made this happen. In fact, the welfare schemes of the BJP government and the direct benefit transfer (DBT) has been a hit with the poor in India.\n\nIts headline was 'India election results: Modi in coalition talks after losing majority'.\n\nThey wrote, \"Modi was forced to turn to local partners from the National Democratic \u00adAlliance (NDA) for support after his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to retain its majority in the world's largest general election, let alone achieve a predicted landslide.\"\n\n3. Deutsche Welle asks if results are 'setback for PM Modi'\n\nGermany's DW ran the main story of the 2024 Lok Sabha electio results under the headline 'A setback for PM Modi?'\n\n\"India election: Modi-led alliance seals majority The coalition led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party has passed the 272-seat threshold needed for a majority, official results show. But the opposition has made major gains,\" the DW reported.\n\n4. Le Monde says Modi failed to win by landslide\n\nFrance's Le Monde wrote, \"Modi set to remain India's PM but fails to win by landslide.\" \" After 10 years of uninterrupted power, the prime minister won the parliamentary elections on Tuesday, June 4, with a narrow majority, at the end of a six-week marathon election.\"\n\n5. The Japan Times calls it a 'stunning disappointment'\n\nThe Japan Times wrote, \"Narendra Modi vows to retain power in India even as BJP loses majority.\"\n\n\"The result is a stunning disappointment for the 73-year-old leader, who has been the main face of the BJP's election campaign and built the party primarily around himself. Besides raising questions about Modi's own future as prime minister, a weak coalition government will likely make it difficult for him to push through tough economic reforms or further his Hindu nationalist agenda, assuming he returns to power,\" read the piece in the Tokyo-based daily.\n\nHOW MEDIA IN NEIGHBOURHOOD INTERPRETED THE RESULTS\n\nNewspapers and media outlets in neighbouring countries commented on the result of the General Elections of 2024. The elections in India are especially important for its neighbours as several policies pertaining to international relations have implications on the neighbouring countries.\n\nThey had a close watch on the Lok Sabha election 2024 too.\n\n6. Global Times sees Modi win through Indo-China relations\n\nThe Chinese state-run Global Times headlined their story as, \"Modi claims victory with alliance winning only narrow majority.\"\n\n\"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed victory for a third term on Tuesday, as he released a statement on social media. Chinese experts said that, however, Modi's ambition to compete with Chinese manufacturing and improve India's business environment will be difficult to accomplish,\" noted The Global Times, which is owned by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC).\n\n\"Given Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to secure an outright majority of seats despite his alliance getting it, it will be hard for the prime minister to push economic reform but likely to play the card of nationalism, said experts, adding they expected that China-India relations are also unlikely to improve much,\" the report said.\n\n7. Pakistan's Dawn brings in the Muslim angle\n\nDawn, the Pakistani news outlet, carried the headline 'India defeats hate, Modi left at mercy of Muslim-friendly allies'.\n\n\"Indian voters gave Prime Minister Narendra Modi a pyrrhic victory on Tuesday, handing his National Democratic Alliance (NDA) a clear mandate, but robbing the BJP of a majority on its own. Modi has been used to ruling wilfully with his own ironclad majority; 13 years as Gujarat chief minister and 10 as premier,\" wrote the Karachi-based newspaper, founded by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, with its tone of bias.\n\n8. Bangladesh's Daily Star calls it a 'humbling verdict'\n\n'Modi, allies to meet after humbling election verdict' is how the Bangladesh's Daily Star headlined the Lok Sabha election report on its website.\n\n\"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set to meet his allies on Wednesday to discuss forming the government, a day after his Hindu nationalist party lost its outright majority in parliament in a surprise election verdict,\" wrote the Dhaka-based Daily Star.\n\n9. 'Victory with a reduced majority', notes Colombo's The Island\n\nThe Island of Sri Lanka headlined the election report as 'India's Modi claims victory as he heads for reduced majority'.\n\n\"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has claimed a historic third win in a row in the country's parliamentary elections, but his ruling alliance appears to have failed to win a large majority as predicted,\" wrote The Island.\n\n10. Win amid 'deepening minority concerns', says The Jakarta Post\n\nThe Jakarta Post of Indonesia headlined the election results report as 'Modi celebrates victory in India vote, but falls short of landslide'.\n\n\"Commentators and exit polls had projected an overwhelming victory for Modi, whose campaign wooed the Hindu majority to the worry of the country's 200-million-plus Muslim community, deepening concerns over minority rights,\" noted the Jakarta Post.\n\n10. The Star underlines BJP's seat dip\n\n'India election throws up surprise as BJP win with smaller numbers' was how the Malaysian media outlet The Star headlined its report on the 2024 Lok Sabha election results.\n\n11. The Straits Times highlights coalition prospects\n\n'India election: Modi's BJP wins historic third term, but loses decade-old parliamentary majority' headlined The Straits Times of Singapore.\n\n\"India's ruling alliance led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a historic third consecutive term, even as the party lost its decade-old majority in an underwhelming victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He now faces the prospect of a coalition government, which could slow policymaking but also temper Hindu-first instincts that have heightened communal tensions,\" Straits Times wrote.",

        "body": "Chandigarh, Jun 5 (PTI) Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda said Wednesday the BJP's slogans are losing steam and the public is making the party aware of the ground reality.\n\nThe former chief minister also accused the BJP of resorting to divisive tactics based on caste and religion. The BJP has no issue and only wants to make people \"fight on the basis of caste and religion\", he alleged.\n\nAlso Read | What Is the Oath of the Prime Minister of India? Who Administers the Oath of Office and Secrecy to PM?.\n\nHooda said people in the country have shown the mirror to the BJP after it had claimed that the NDA will win 400 seats in the Lok Sabha elections.\n\nElectoral success is achieved through hard work rather than mere slogans, he added.\n\nAlso Read | ICAI CA Foundation Exam 2024: Admit Card for CA Foundation June Examination Released at eservices.icai.org, Know Steps To Download Hall Ticket.\n\n\"The BJP's slogans are losing steam, and the public is making them aware of the ground reality,\" the Congress leader said in Rohtak.\n\nIn the last Lok Sabha election in 2019, the BJP won all 10 seats in Haryana. This time, however, the Congress wrested five of them. The Congress also gained in vote share, which went up from 28.42 per cent in 2019 to 43.67 per cent.\n\nReferring to the three Independent MLAs withdrawing support to the Nayab Singh Saini government last month, Hooda reiterated that the governor should dismiss the \"minority\" BJP government in the state and elections should be held at the earliest.\n\nThe Congress leader also commended the people of Haryana for \"not falling prey to BJP's deceptive strategies\".\n\nPointing at the significant improvement in the Congress' electoral performance, Hooda said that the INDIA bloc secured a combined vote share of 47.61 per cent in Haryana.\n\n\"There has been a remarkable increase in Congress' vote share from 28 per cent in 2019 to almost 48 per cent (Congress and AAP), while the BJP saw a decline in its vote share from 58 per cent (in 2019) to 46.11 per cent.\n\n\"This shift also indicates a strong anti-incumbency wave in Haryana,\" Hooda said, predicting a Congress victory in the assembly elections in the state which are due in October.\n\nHitting out at the BJP government in the state, Hooda said when the Congress was in power, Haryana was leading in per capita income, investment, employment generation, and development.\n\nBut now, the state tops the charts in unemployment, crime, corruption and drug menace, he said.\n\nHooda also accused the BJP government of failing to establish any significant infrastructure or projects in Haryana over the past decade.",

Hooda highlighted that Haryana had the highest vote percentage for the INDIA bloc, with Congress securing 47.6% of the votes, winning five Lok Sabha constituencies, and leading in 46 assembly constituencies. He emphasized that the electorate voted for change and to challenge BJP's dominance. Kumari Selja, another Congress leader who won from Sirsa, acknowledged the need for a better strategy to ensure a decisive victory in the Assembly elections. The BJP, which previously dominated, won only five seats in Haryana, while Congress also secured five. Nationally, the BJP won 240 seats, a significant drop from 2019, while Congress improved to 99 seats. The INDIA bloc posed a strong challenge to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.",

        "body": "In Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, there has been a major political churn. In the former, the spectacular comeback of 74-year-old N Chandrababu Naidu to the driving seat should come as a relief to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He adds 16 crucial parliamentary seats to the NDA's kitty. Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has also won 135 seats in the 175-member Andhra Pradesh Assembly. In Odisha, the BJP has decimated Naveen Patnaik's Biju Janata Dal which has been in power for almost 25 years.\n\nNaidu, once famous as \"CEO of Andhra Pradesh\" who pioneered economic reforms and modernisation, has a lot to prove in his new avatar as a welfarist. Naidu has had to airbrush his earlier image as the hard-nosed reformist who brought in 'smart governance' in the 1990s because that single-minded focus on IT-led growth cost him an election in 2004. In the last decade or so, Naidu was faced with the welfarist governance model of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. These had to be politically neutralised by Naidu's own \"Super Six\" schemes that included vast benefits for farmers, school children, three free gas cylinders annually, among other promises. Jagan Mohan Reddy lost the Assembly and Parliamentary elections despite his welfarist pitch.\n\nIndeed, Naidu is saddled with the political burden of continuing the welfare measures, even as Andhra Pradesh's finances are a bit shaky. According to the Reserve Bank of India's December 2023 report on State Finances, AP's fiscal deficit was budgeted at 3.8 per cent of GSDP for FY24 (a revenue deficit of 1.5 per cent). This is above the prevailing fiscal deficit level for all States, at 3.1 per cent of GSDP in FY24 (and a 0.1 per cent revenue deficit for all States). Its outstanding liabilities at 35.2 per cent of its GSDP, too are way above the States' average of 27.6 of GSDP. With off-Budget borrowings and contingent liabilities, this figure would exceed 50 per cent. It is against this backdrop of climbing deficits that he intends to build a capital city. For those extra funds, Naidu is likely to push once again for special status for the State with respect to finances (an assurance that came about after the creation of Telangana). He quit the NDA over this issue in 2018, and since then the matter has been hanging fire -- since the Fourteenth Finance panel questioned the 'special states' concept after enhancing States' share in its devolution formula. Ultimately, Naidu and the Centre need each other for financial and political reasons, respectively -- an inter-dependence that could keep the alliance going.\n\nIn Odisha, BJP has seized power with a simple majority of 78 in the 147-member Assembly. With an ageing Patnaik and decimated Congress, the BJP hardly faces any real opposition. Odisha's finances are robust, with outstanding liabilities at 13.9 per cent of GSDP, and a fiscal deficit of 3 per cent of GSDP in FY24 (budgeted); the revenue surplus for FY24 is as high as 3.1 per cent. There is elbow room for capital expenditure and social welfare schemes. Both States are in for major changes.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on June 5, 2024",

You successfully silenced the noise from all sides, which increased as the polling days came closer. Be it your neta who asked you to vote on religion, caste, even offered freebies in the name of policies, etc. or TV news anchors who promoted politician's propaganda.

        "body": "India's message\n\nThe Indian voters conveyed an appropriate message to PM Narendra Modi - never take us for granted. The BJP-led NDA managed to overtake the INDIA bloc, but the margin of the win was not as expected or predicted by exit polls.\n\nA stable government is very necessary but not at the cost of intolerance, hate-mongering and social polarisation. BJP's ultimate goal was the Congress-mukt and Opposition-mukt India, but the Opposition has come back into real reckoning in the country and in Parliament.\n\nThe BJP is likely to be kept on its toes not only by its allies but also Congress and allies.\n\nGregory Fernandes\n\nMumbai\n\nNew approach needed\n\nThis refers to the edit \"Back to coalition\" (June 5). BJP's unexpected debacle in Lok Sabha polls reminds of what Sun Tzu said, \"He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.\" Narendra Modi's overconfidence and arrogance cost the party dearly. Now the nation will be ruled by a weak coalition led by a strong-willed Prime Minister. This contradictory combination will not be effective unless Modi shows resilience and patience in his dealings with his partners like Atal Bihari Vajpayee did during his premiership.\n\nElection Commission has reinforced its efficiency and objectivity. Modi and the Opposition must work together constructively. The initiative has to come from Modi.\n\nYG Chouksey\n\nPune\n\nApropos 'Can Naidu create another Hyderabad (June 5)' Though the exit polls of Andhra clearly showed a major win for TDP, JS, BJP coalition, a disastrous defeat for YSRCP was not anticipated. Lack of development and jobs and YSRCP's reliance on only welfare freebies was rejected by voters. Anti-incumbency wave was a big factor hitting the BJP at the national level and boosted Rahul Gandhi's Congress alliance. But for Chandrababu Naidu, Hyderabad would never have become a world class city and an IT hub.\n\nIt will be a herculean task for Naidu to create another 'Hyderabad'. But a good beginning for the TDP-JS-BJP combine to announce Amaravati as a capital and starts its development work.\n\nKaturu Durga Prasad Rao\n\nHyderabad\n\nRise of regional parties\n\nThe 18th Lok Sabha elections reveal a nation loyal to democracy and its core principles, rejecting divisive ideologies. While craving stability, voters won't tolerate intolerance or hate-driven agendas.\n\nDespite BJP's ambition, they fell short of an absolute majority, signalling a shift in political dynamics. The BJP's \"Congress-free India\" vision contrasts with the Opposition's resurgence, led by regional parties.\n\nUnderstanding grassroots realities, not just rhetoric, is vital for electoral success.\n\nRegional parties, sidelined in recent years, now play pivotal roles, ensuring diversity in governance.\n\nVijaykumar H K\n\nRaichur\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on June 5, 2024",

        "summary": "The recent Indian elections have sent a clear message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA: voters should not be taken for granted. Although the NDA managed to surpass the INDIA bloc, the victory margin was narrower than exit polls had predicted. The electorate emphasized the need for a stable government that does not promote intolerance, hate, or social polarization. The BJP's goal of a Congress-free and Opposition-free India has been challenged, with the Opposition gaining significant ground in Parliament.\n\nThe BJP's unexpected poor performance in the Lok Sabha polls has been attributed to Modi's overconfidence and arrogance. The new government will be a coalition led by a strong-willed Prime Minister, but its effectiveness will depend on Modi's ability to work patiently and resiliently with his partners, similar to former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh, the TDP-JS-BJP coalition's victory was anticipated, but the YSRCP's defeat was more severe than expected, largely due to anti-incumbency sentiments and a lack of development and jobs. The coalition's challenge now is to develop Amaravati into a new capital, akin to Hyderabad's transformation under Chandrababu Naidu.\n\nThe elections also highlighted the resurgence of regional parties, which are now crucial in ensuring diverse governance. The electorate's rejection of divisive ideologies underscores the importance of understanding grassroots realities for political success.",

However, experts are now skeptical as the election outcomes fell short of expectations, leaving the BJP in a position where it must rely on the NDA alliance to establish a government, causing concern among investors.\n\nBrokerage firm Emkay Global recommended investors to switch from PSUs and Capital Goods to FMCG stocks.\n\n\"We see Narendra Modi returning as PM but in changed circumstances. The broad direction of the economy is unlikely to change, though factor market reform and privatization are off the table. India is likely to now derate due to higher risk perception. Switch from PSUs and Capital Goods to FMCG and buy Indian equities if the Nifty falls below 20,000 (18x FY25 PER),\" the brokerage firm said.\n\nInvestors are urged to steer clear of PSUs and capital goods sectors as they appear to be the most vulnerable at the moment. However, there's optimism regarding the resurgence of consumption, particularly in FMCG and value retail segments, which are expected to make a robust comeback.\n\nAlso read: Election results shocker! PSUs unlikely to re-rate, FMCG, private banks in focus, says PL; lists top stock picks\n\nRupen Rajguru, Head Equity Investments and Strategy, Julius Baer India, said that IT and healthcare sectors are also likely to outperform capex oriented sectors.\n\n\"In the near term defensives (FMCG, IT and Healthcare) will outperform capex oriented sectors. Additionally, some of the sectors with strong narratives - PSUs, Defense, Railways will take a breather and can potentially see some de-rating from the current near all-time high valuations,\" Rajguru said.\n\nIn the longer term, Rajguru maintains his overweight stance on Financials, Autos, Real Estate, and select Industrials/Manufacturing companies.\"\n\nPrashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, advises investors to focus on defensive and non-government-driven sectors. \" Traders and investors should be cautious and consider focusing on defensive and non-government-driven sectors such as FMCG, Telecom, and Pharma stocks. The upcoming budget and quarterly earnings reports will be crucial events that could influence market movements,\" Tapse said.\n\nTapse further added that the stock market is likely to remain volatile in the short term even as the NDA-led BJP is set to form the government for the third time, making history.\n\nGiven the known factors, it's advisable to allow some time for the markets to stabilize following the unexpected election outcome, he said.\n\nAlso read: Investors return to Indian equities with consumption sectors in spotlight\n\nExperts advise traders to remain cautious about about investing in momentum stocks or small cap stocks which outperformed in the last two years.\n\n\"In the current market scenario, the investors should remain cautious about investing in momentum stocks or small cap stocks which have remained overheated over the past two years. Any sustained period of sideways or downward movement in momentum stocks can trigger a sell-off in these stocks. Investors, therefore, should consider the risk involved before making such investments,\" said Vaibhav Porwal, Co-founder, Dezerv.\n\nPorwal added, \"Having said that, a steep fall in the market without any structural change in the fundamentals must be regarded as an opportunity. We believe that the investors should capitalise on this opportunity for fresh investments in equity.\n\nAlso, investors should keep in mind that a BJP-led coalition government is not necessarily bad for the economy, and this is not the first time we will see a coalition government. From 1989 to 2014, our GDP grew by more than 8% annually while a coalition government was at the Centre. What we saw in the markets yesterday was a knee-jerk reaction. As the speculative trades built around election results unwind and as clarity around the new government emerges, markets will find their ground.\"\n\nYou are on Mint!

        "title": "Misreading of election outcomes",
        "body": "The 2024 Parliament election results have surprised everyone. It was taken for granted for last few months that BJP is going to cross the halfway mark on its own and the whole discussion was about how high it will go?\n\nThe exit polls seem to suggest a bigger victory for BJP/NDA. All the ten polls that I saw on various TV channels gave at least 350 seats to the NDA and some of them even predicted 400 seats. All of them have been proven to be wrong. Where did they go wrong? What does the result mean for the governance of the country in the next five years?\n\nIt is clear that there will be a coalition government. With BJP being only 30-35 short of the majority mark, it will be close to 290 along with its pre-election allies; so it is likely that we will again see Narendra Modi as the next Prime Minister.\n\nThe government will have to be more careful in taking decisions and will have to take along its allies.\n\nIt should be noted that while BJP has kept its vote share, its seats went down by about 60! The major factor for this is that the leading contenders came together in several States and formed an alliance against BJP/NDA. This factor had been named the 'index of opposition unity' in the era when Congress was the dominant party. While this 'index' varied from State to State, it worked very well in UP and Maharashtra -- the two largest States (in terms of seats in Parliament). These are the two States where BJP/NDA suffered the biggest loss. While the INDI alliance was a loose alliance, the fact that SP and Congress fought as allies in UP had a big impact.\n\nAlso Congress' vote share in UP went up significantly. These led to the biggest upset for BJP/NDA. In Maharashtra, NDA suffered a big loss as the erstwhile partner Shiv Sena went out of NDA and aligned with Congress along with NCP. Later Shiv Sena and NCP split, but had limited impact. The next big loss is Rajasthan, where there was a direct contest between BJP and Congress. Perhaps several local factors may have contributed for the loss. In Bengal, the TMC on its own snatched about 6-7 seats from BJP.\n\nIndeed, if BJP and NDA had not made gains in Andhra and Telangana, NDA would have been just above the majority mark.\n\nExit polls fiasco\n\nWhat went wrong with exit polls? Since I was not associated with any exit poll this time, I can give my views! Firstly, the exit polls have their limitations as implementing proper sampling when choosing respondents as they exit from the polling booth is very difficult, if not impossible. We had worked on an alternative to exit poll -- which we called the day-after-poll -- where sampling is done by proper methodology and the chosen respondents are asked questions by going to their residence the day after they have voted. This had yielded very good results over the years.\n\nPeople at large, including experts in media, politics and other walks of life, perhaps do not understand the importance of randomly choosing the respondents (or the sample) in statistical decision-making. They forget or do not know that the statistical guarantee that the sample proportion (of any observed attribute, including say supporters of a party) is close to the true proportion (in the population under consideration) kicks in only when the sample is chosen randomly! A randomly chosen sample of, say, 30,000 (even in such a large country as India) is better than a sample of size three lakh chosen by some other means. By better I mean that the chances of being widely off the mark are rather low.\n\nThe other issue is that perhaps psephologists make projections based on data and mix it with expert opinion in their decision. I can say that if projections were solely based on randomly chosen data, devoid of mixing it with expert opinion, we would not see a scenario where several agencies who have done surveys independently of each other go wrong by a big margin, and all errors are one-sided.\n\nOne good outcome of the results seems to be that the attack on EVMs and the Election Commission that we had seen over the last several weeks has now taken a back seat. After all, after making a big gain, the Opposition cannot attack EVMs and the EC, questioning their own gains.\n\nThere will be a lot of introspection among all parties about what was right and what was wrong. One would hope that the bickering among the ruling party/alliance and Opposition parties ends or at least comes down soon and the government goes on with decision-making.\n\nThe writer is Professor Emeritus, Chennai Mathematical Institute\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on June 5, 2024",

        "summary": "The 2024 Parliament election results in India have defied expectations, with the BJP/NDA falling short of the anticipated majority. Despite exit polls predicting a significant victory with at least 350 seats, the BJP ended up around 30-35 seats short of the majority mark, securing close to 290 seats with its pre-election allies. This outcome suggests a coalition government, likely led by Narendra Modi as Prime Minister.\n\nThe BJP's seat count dropped by about 60, despite maintaining its vote share, primarily due to opposition unity in key states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. In UP, the alliance between SP and Congress significantly impacted BJP's performance, while in Maharashtra, the departure of Shiv Sena from NDA to join Congress and NCP led to substantial losses. Additionally, BJP faced setbacks in Rajasthan and Bengal.\n\nThe exit polls' inaccuracies are attributed to challenges in proper sampling and potential biases from mixing data with expert opinions. The results have shifted focus away from criticisms of EVMs and the Election Commission, as the opposition's gains undermine such attacks. Moving forward, introspection among political parties is expected, with hopes for reduced bickering and effective governance.",

        "title": "India News | BJP Wins 8 of 17 SC-reserved Seats in UP, Lowest in Last Three Polls | LatestLY",
        "body": "Lucknow, Jun 5 (PTI) The BJP, which has been performing well on the Lok Sabha seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes in Uttar Pradesh in the last two general elections, has got a jolt in the latest one.\n\nOf the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state, 17 are reserved for the SCs (Dalits). The BJP won eight of them while the opposition parties won nine of these reserved seats.\n\nAlso Read | Devendra Fadnavis Proposes To Resign From Deputy CM Post: Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde Says 'Poll Defeat is Collective Responsibility'.\n\nWhile the Samajwadi Party (SP) won seven seats, the Congress won one and the new \"hero\" of Dalit politics, Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram) chief Chandrashekhar Azad, won from the Nagina constituency.\n\nThe BJP had registered a one-sided victory on all the 17 SC-reserved seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. But in 2019, out of these 17 seats, it lost Nagina and Lalganj seats to the BSP. The remaining 14 seats were won by the BJP and one seat of Robertsganj was won by BJP's ally Apna Dal (S).\n\nAlso Read | Monsoon 2024: Rain Lashes Several Parts of Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Telangana; Waterlogging Reported in Guwahati (Watch Videos).\n\nIn the 2024 general elections, the BJP has won only eight reserved seats -- Bulandshahr, Hathras, Agra, Shahjahanpur, Hardoi, Misrikh, Bansgaon and Bahraich.\n\nOn the other hand, the SP won Robertsganj, Machhlishahr, Lalganj, Kaushambi, Jalaun, Mohanlalganj and Etawah seats. The Congress won from Barabanki and the Azad Samaj Party won from Nagina.\n\nIn the 2024 elections, when SP chief Akhilesh Yadav declared nine-time MLA and Dalit community member Awadhesh Prasad as the candidate for the general seat of Faizabad (Ayodhya), people were shocked. But Prasad defeated two-time MP and former minister Lallu Singh from the prestigious seat.\n\nThe BSP, which once reached the pinnacle of politics and power on the basis of Dalit vote bank, could not even open its account.\n\nCongress leader P L Punia, a former MP and former chairman of National Scheduled Caste Commission, told PTI that last time some SC votes went to the BSP and some went to the BJP. He claimed that this time none went to the BJP and only a limited number went to the BSP.\n\n\"This time, the entire vote shifted to INDIA bloc,\" Punia said.\n\nPunia was elected Congress MP from Barabanki Lok Sabha constituency in 2009. His son Tanuj Punia, who was once close to Mayawati, defeated BJP candidate Rajrani Rawat by 2,15,704 votes on Barabanki (reserved) seat.\n\nAsked the reason for the Dalits voting for the INDIA bloc, Punia said, \"The INDIA bloc promised Rs 1 lakh annually, jobs, unemployment allowance and minimum wage of Rs 400 for the poor families. This was quite effective.\"\n\nApart from this, the people were cautioned by the claims of the BJP leaders that they need over 400 seats to change the Constitution made by Baba Saheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar.\n\nPunia said, \"Both these things came from the BJP itself. So the voters became alert that they will not let the Constitution change under any circumstances. This was a big factor.\n\n\"It is well known that the Bahujan Samaj Party has joined hands with the BJP. So the Dalits voted in large numbers for the INDIA bloc. We will live up to their expectations,' he said.\n\nTalking about the crushing defeat, a BSP worker, \"We have suffered losses due to Behenji (Mayawati) announcing the removal of her nephew and successor Akash Anand from all posts in the middle of the election.'\n\nBJP's Kamlesh Paswan was declared victorious from Bansgaon seat by a margin of just 3,150 votes. On the other hand, prominent leaders like Union minister Kaushal Kishore from Mohanlalganj and Bhanu Pratap Verma from Jalaun also had to face defeat this time.\n\nWith more than half of the reserved seats being occupied by the opposition parties, political analysts have started claiming that the BJP has failed in the management of the reserved seats.\n\nDr Sushil Pandey, professor of History department in Baba Saheb Ambedkar Central University, Lucknow and author of the book 'Caste and Politics in Democracy', told PTI, \"It is too early to reach any conclusive point in this, but it cannot be denied that the anger of the voters over the selection of the BJP's candidates, the slogans about saving the Constitution, protecting reservation and increasing the amount of ration given by the opposition parties attracted the Dalits towards them.\"\n\nDuring the election campaign, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had alleged that the ruling BJP will change the Constitution and end reservation if the NDA wins more than 400 seats.\n\nA senior BJP leader, on the condition of anonymity, said, \"We thought that the traditional vote bank of the BSP is ours as the party is weakening and also because of our distribution of five kg of food grains. But a large number of Dalits came under the influence of the leaders of the opposition alliance in the name of saving the Constitution and reservation.\"\n\nHe said its effect was not only on the seats reserved for the Dalits but also on the general seats where the candidates of the opposition parties got the votes of the Dalit.\n\nThe INDIA bloc has also made new experiments to woo the Dalits which comprise 29 per cent of the population.\n\nAfter the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, top BJP leaders were accusing the opposition parties of rejecting the invitation for the consecration ceremony and for being anti-Sanatan.\n\nBut in the same Ayodhya, the SP's strategy of fielding Prasad clicked and he defeated the BJP candidate Lallu Singh, who was a kar sevak of the Ram Mandir movement.\n\nPolitical analyst and Dalit thinker Rakesh Kumar, a resident of Ghazipur, told PTI that Akhilesh Yadav had certainly taken a big risk by fielding a Dalit candidate on a general seat. But he reaped benefits not only in Ayodhya but also on other seats of the state.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, Nagina, Bulandshahr, Hathras, Agra, Shahjahanpur, Hardoi, Misrikh, Etawah, Bahraich, Mohanlalganj, Jalaun, Kaushambi, Barabanki, Lalganj, Machhlishahr, Bansgaon and Robertsganj Lok Sabha seats are reserved for the SCs.",

This marks a stark contrast to the BJP's previous dominance, having won all 17 SC-reserved seats in 2014 and 14 in 2019.\n\nKey factors contributing to this shift include the opposition's promises of economic benefits and job opportunities, as well as concerns over potential changes to the Constitution and reservation policies under a BJP majority. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) failed to win any seats, partly due to internal issues. Prominent BJP leaders, including Union ministers, faced defeats, indicating a broader dissatisfaction among Dalit voters. Political analysts suggest that the BJP's candidate selection and the opposition's effective campaigning on constitutional and reservation issues swayed the Dalit vote towards the INDIA bloc.",

The Election Commission of India has declared the results of the 543 Lok Sabha constituencies, with the BJP winning 240 seats and the Congress 99.\n\nThe BJP fell 32 seats short of the 272 majority mark after votes polled in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections were counted. For the first time, since the Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it did not secure a majority on its own. (ANI)",

        "body": "The first meeting of leaders of the National Democratic Alliance after the election results was held at caretaker Prime Minister Narendra D Modi's residence in New Delhi on Wednesday, June 5, 2024.\n\nThe meeting was attended by Bharatiya Janata Party President J P Nadda, caretaker Home Minister Amit A Shah, caretaker Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Telugu Desam Party President Nara Chandrababu Naidu, Janata Dal-United President Nitish Kumar, Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde, Janata Dal-Secular leader H D Kumaraswamy, Janasena Party chief Pawan Kalyan, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan, Nationalist Congress Party (Ajit Pawar faction) MP Praful Patel among others.\n\nNaidu and Nitish Kumar's presence at the NDA meeting is significant as the support of their parties is crucial for the BJP to form the government.\n\nThis time, the BJP fell 32 seats short of the majority mark of 272 and will need to rely on its allies to form a government.\n\nIMAGE: Modi with Naidu and Nitish Kumar.

Next to him was Nitish Kumar, whose JD-U won 12 seats.\n\nEknath Shinde Sena's 7 seats gave the Maharashtra leader a place at the high table.\n\nOther NDA allies sat alongside in order of number of seats won.\n\nIMAGE: Rajnath Singh and Amit A Shah were the only two Cabinet ministers present on the podium with Nadda and Modi during Tuesday's celebrations at the BJP national headquarters.\n\nIMAGE: Amit A Shah is being blamed in some quarters for the BJP's losses in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIMAGE: Caretaker Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Anupriya Patel, who heads the Apna Dal (Soneylal) party, with Praful Patel.\n\nIMAGE: Pawan Kalyan and Anupriya Patel.\n\nIMAGE: Asom Gana Parishad President Atul Bora and other leaders at the NDA meeting.\n\nIMAGE: Modi chats with Nitish Kumar who only rejoined the NDA in January.

        "title": "Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Did INDIA bloc seat-share benefit Congress more than its allies? Yes, but...",
        "body": "When the INDIA bloc was formed in early 2023, it was debated who would eat into whose vote share in different states. Would the Congress transfer its votes to the regional parties or vice versa? Now that the Lok Sabha Election Results 2024 are out, here's what it shows:\n\nAccording to political expert Abhimanyu Bharti, the Congress benefited in states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra \"where there was a direct alliance.\" In states such as West Bengal and Punjab -- where the alliance partners contested against each other -- the alliance managed to reduce the BJP-led NDA's seat share.\n\nMoreover, analysis showed that regional parties seemed to have gained more than the Congress in West Bengal, Kerala and Punjab where INDIA bloc allies were in contest against each other.\n\nUttar Pradesh: The SP won 37 seats - the maximum among all the other parties. The Congress won six seats of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats. In 2019, when the SP had contested in alliance with the Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP), the SP had won five seats and the Congress just one. Both parties' seats and vote share rose in the 2024 polls.\n\nMaharashtra: The Congress pulled a surprise by winning 13 Lok Sabha seats, more than any other political party in the state. The party had won just one seat in 2019 elections. Also, the Congress secured 16.96 percent of the total vote share in Maharashtra, which was marginally up from 16.41 percent in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nThe Congress' allies - the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackrey) won nine seats, and the Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar) won eight seats. The INDIA bloc won 30 seats of 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra.\n\nTamil Nadu: The INDIA bloc ally Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) transferred three seats to the Congress and one to the CPIM. Meanwhile, the Congress and the CPIM transferred one seat to the DMK. Here's a look at seats which were transferred within INDIA bloc allies in Tamil Nadu:\n\nThe DMK won a whopping 22 seats in Tamil Nadu, which sent 39 members to Lok Sabha. The Congress, meanwhile, won nine seats in the state. The 2024 results were similar to that in 2019. In the last Lok Sabha polls, the DMK won 24 seats, and the Congress won 8.\n\nThe vote share of the Congress declined in Tamil Nadu from 12.62 percent to 10.6 percent, while that of the DMK declined from 33.53 percent to 26.9 percent.\n\nWest Bengal: India bloc allies TMC and the Congress went solo in Bengal. Mamata Banerjee's TMC won 29 of 42 Lok Sabha seats - up from 22 in 2019. The BJP plunged to 12 seats - down from 18 in 2019. The Congress just won one seat in 2024 polls - down from two in 2019 elections.\n\nHowever, the vote share of the TMC increased marginally from 43.69 percent to 45 percent in Bengal, while that of the Congress decreased from 5.6 percent to 4 percent in 2024.\n\nPunjab: India bloc allies Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party contested against each other in Punjab. The AAP grabbed the Anandpur Sahib seat from Congress, but Congress didn't lose any seat to the AAP.\n\nIt was their vote share which was impacted. The Congress vote share declined from 40.58 percent in 2019 to 26 percent in 2024. The AAP's vote share increased significantly from 7.46 percent in 2019 to 26 percent on 2024.\n\nThe Congress won seven seats in 2024 - down from eight in 2019. The AAP won three seats - up from one in 2019. The BJP, this time, failed to open its account in Punjab - losing the two seats it had won in 2019.\n\nKerala: Here, the Congress' vote share saw decline of around 2 percent from 37.4 percent in 2019 to 35 percent in 2024. That of the CPIM declined marginally from 25.9 in 2019 to 25.82 in 2024.\n\nHowever, in Kerala, the BJP opened its account by winning one seat in the state. The party had won no Lok Sabha seat in the state in the 2019 elections. It vote share also increased from 12.9 percent in 2019 to 16 percent in 2024.\n\nIndia bloc allies Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) contested against each other in Kerala. The Congress won 14 of the 20 Lok Sabha seats in the southern states - down from 15 in 2019. Among the 14, the Congress won Alappuzha seat - the lone seat its partner CPI(M) had won in 2019. Meanwhile, the Alathur was transferred to the CPIM from Congress in 2024.\n\nLast year, when the INDIA bloc was formed, it was discussed whether the political parties would be able to keep the flock together. As the Lok Sabha Elections 2024 came closer, the opposition's coalition started falling apart. How?\n\nMamata Banerjee's TMC went solo in West Bengal for Lok Sabha polls, the Congress and the AAP contested against each other in Punjab and JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar snapped ties with INDIA to join the rival Bharatiya Jana Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).\n\nHowever, the INDIA bloc posed a tough fight against the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Lok Sabha Elections 2024, leading to unexpected results in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "body": "Mamata Banerjee, the only woman Chief Minister in India at present, has pushed for 38 per cent women's representation from her party in the 18th Lok Sabha, the highest by any political outfit in the country.\n\nThe feisty mass leader from West Bengal, who is one of the few women party supremos in India, has handpicked a set of spunky women to fight the Lok Sabha Elections 2024, and these ladies have stolen the spotlight in an otherwise androcentric political system of India.\n\nEleven of the 29 elected Lok Sabha MPs of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) are women. Banerjee's chosen set are an electric mix ranging from corporate top-brass like Mohua Moitra; street fighters and steadfast loyalists like Sajda Ahmed and Mala Roy; professionals (doctors) like Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and Sharmila Sarkar; actors like June Maliah, Racha Banerjee, Satabdi Roy and Sayoni Ghosh; and other leaders like Mitali Bag and Pratima Mondal.\n\nAmongst her MPs, the combative Mohua Moitra - a vehement Modi-critic - has often been trending on social media for her fiery speeches in the Parliament and the steadfast opposition to 'divisive politics'.\n\nMoitra's maiden speech in the Parliament, opposing the Motion of Thanks on June 25 2019, where she took on the Modi government point-by-point despite many interruptions from the ruling benches and spoke on the \"seven signs of fascism\" criticising the BJP-led ruling coalition stole the limelight. And she has never looked back since then.\n\nIn local West Bengal politics, actor Sayoni Ghosh - who was subsequently elevated as President of the youth wing of the TMC has made her presence felt as someone who has taken on the Opposition.\n\nRS representation\n\nIn Rajya Sabha too, Banerjee's women brigade is a reflection of her outspoken nature. Her Upper House MPs like Dola Sen have often taken to task members of the ruling party, while there are others like Mausam Benazir Noor and Sagarika Ghose who have been making strong statements.\n\nIncidentally, 2024 was the first election after passage of the Women's Reservation Bill.\n\nOverall representation dips\n\nThere will be at least 73 women MPs in the 18th Lok Sabha (13 per cent) as against 78 in the 17th Lok Sabha (14 per cent).\n\nIn addition to the 11 MPs of the Trinamool, the Lower House will have at least 30 women MPs from the BJP (13 per cent of 240) and 13 from the Congress (14 per cent of 99). The SP has four, the DMK will have three, and JD(U) will have two.\n\nMajor names gracing the Parliament now would include Kangana Ranaut and Hema Malini from the BJP, Supriya Sule from the NCP, Sharadchandra Pawar, and Misa Bharati from the RJD, among others. This year, there will be some young faces, with 25-year-olds Shambhavi Choudhary of the LJP, Priya Saroj of the Samajwadi Party, and Sanjana Jatav of the Congress entering Parliament.\n\nWomen constituted 48.41 per cent of India's population in 2022.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on June 5, 2024",

        "summary": "Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of West Bengal and leader of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), has championed women's representation by ensuring 38% of her party's candidates for the 18th Lok Sabha are women, the highest among Indian political parties. Eleven out of TMC's 29 elected MPs are women, including notable figures like Mohua Moitra, Sajda Ahmed, and Sayoni Ghosh. Moitra, known for her fiery speeches against the Modi government, has gained significant attention. In the Rajya Sabha, Banerjee's female MPs, such as Dola Sen, also reflect her assertive style.\n\nThe 2024 elections, the first after the Women's Reservation Bill, saw a slight dip in overall female representation in the Lok Sabha, with 73 women MPs (13%) compared to 78 (14%) in the previous term. The BJP has 30 women MPs, Congress 13, and other parties like SP, DMK, and JD(U) have smaller numbers. Notable women MPs include Kangana Ranaut and Hema Malini from the BJP, and Supriya Sule from the NCP. The new Parliament also features young faces like 25-year-olds Shambhavi Choudhary, Priya Saroj, and Sanjana Jatav. Women make up 48.41% of India's population as of 2022.",

The major loss has left all senior party leaders shocked and surprised and they are refusing to comment on it. However, off the record, they are engaged in significant discussions.\n\nParty leaders confirmed to IANS that the senior leaders failed to balance the Rajput and Jat equations in the state. They were overconfident and considered that Rajasthan has become a major BJP dominated state and hence claimed that the party will win all 25 seats.

This became a game changer in Rajasthan politics and left the Jat lobby annoyed.\n\nThe consequences were also manifested in other parts of the state like Barmer and Jhunjhunu and Sikar and were also felt in parts of Haryana as the Jats boycotted the BJP. Surprisingly, no senior leader could be seen who could have checked the deteriorating equations between the BJP and the Jat leader.

Rupala had said, \"Erstwhile maharajas (Kshatriya kings) had succumbed to foreign rulers like the British and forged family bonds with them. Princely families broke bread with the British rulers and also married their daughters to them.\"\n\nThe Meena voters were annoyed after veteran leader Kirodilal Meena was not given a decent portfolio after the assembly polls. Eventually the party lost the Dausa seat as the Meenas voted in support of the Congress. The Meenas, Gurjars and Jats boycotted the BJP and voted for the Congress making it victorious on the Bharatpur and Tonk Sawai Madhopur seats.\n\nThirdly, a leadership crisis was seen in the state. The entire election in Rajasthan was led by Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma. Besides him, no other leader was active in the state. Sharma's total political experience in the state is of five months. He is a first time MLA who was anointed as Chief Minister.\n\nSenior leaders like Vasundhara Raje were stuck in their own areas. Raje was seen campaigning for her son Dushyant in Jhalawad throughout the elections. The BJP's state president CP Joshi was contesting the election himself and former Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore was stuck in Churu. The lack of an experienced leadership in the BJP became the reason for the big defeat, said sources.\n\nThe party workers banked on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and did no ground work on their own. While the Congress changed 22 faces for the polls, the BJP could not change that many candidates. In fact, the people which it brought were also questioned. Also there were no young faces driving the youngsters, party leaders said.\n\nSenior journalist Manish Godha said, \"Caste equations went against the BJP in these elections, Major castes like Rajputs, Jats, Meenas and Gurjars boycotted the BJP. Kirodi became a factor for Meena, Gurjars were lured to Sachin Pilot, Jats boycotted due to the farm laws and the Kaswan issue and the Rajputs due to a Gujarat leader's comments.\n\nThese were four major castes which were a big vote bank for the BJP but did not favour the saffron party this time. The other major factor was that a strong leadership and a crowd puller face were missing. The BJP relied on general caste votes and the OBCs but these castes did not turn up for voting. Overdependence on PM Modi is yet another factor which came up.\"\n\nMeanwhile, State Energy Minister Hiralal Nagar said \"A government is being formed in the country under the leadership of the NDA. The shortcomings that were there in Rajasthan will be reviewed. We accept the public mandate.\" Education minister Madan Dilawar said that \"The party will review the low lead. The government will be formed under the leadership of the NDA. Narendra Modi will become the Prime Minister for the third time.\"",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP suffered a significant setback in Rajasthan, losing 11 seats. This loss is attributed to the boycott by major castes such as Jats, Rajputs, Meenas, and Gurjars. Key issues included internal conflicts, such as the denial of a ticket to sitting MP Rahul Kaswan, which alienated the Jat community. Additionally, controversial remarks by Union Minister Parshottam Rupala angered Rajputs, and the sidelining of veteran leader Kirodilal Meena upset the Meena community. The BJP's overconfidence, lack of experienced leadership, and over-reliance on Prime Minister Narendra Modi were also contributing factors. In contrast, the Congress capitalized on these issues, leading to their victory in several constituencies. The BJP has acknowledged the need to review these shortcomings.",

        "title": "No alliance with Congress in future in West Bengal, say two Left Front parties",
        "body": "After a humiliating performance in the Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal, two parties in the Left Front -- the All India Forward Bloc (AIFB) and the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) -- said on June 5 that they were not in favour of any future alliance between the Left Front and the Congress.\n\nThe Left Front failed to win a single seat in the State while Congress bagged one in Malda South. The Trinamool Congress won 29 seats of the 42. The Left Front contested the Lok Sabha election from 33 seats, while the remaining nine constituencies had Congress candidates.\n\nAIFB state secretary Naren Chatterjee said that the alliance between the Congress and the Left in both the Lok Sabha elections of 2019 and 2024 had not worked. The AIFB lost in all three constituencies of Barasat, Purulia, and Coochbehar that they contested. They had a vote share of merely 0.24% across West Bengal. Interestingly, both Purulia and Coochbehar also had Congress candidates even though the parties were in alliance.\n\nMr. Chatterjee said, \"The seat-sharing between the Left Front and the Congress was decided by the CPI(M), we were not consulted. So we had our own candidates in these seats.\"\n\nMr. Chatterjee also blamed the losses on the political history of the Congress in the State where they had been political adversaries in the past. He said, \"Why should we, the Left, bear the burden of the things that Congress has done in Bengal in the past? If we form an alliance, we will never be able to avoid sharing the responsibility.\" He said that his party had no intention of sharing seats with Congress, whom they opposed ideologically.\n\nHistorically, the Congress and the Left have always been at loggerheads in West Bengal. Talking about their next course of action, Mr. Chatterjee said, \"We will discuss this with the entire Left Front and, especially the CPI(M), and say that this alliance cannot go on.\"\n\nThe Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) had a different take. Manoj Bhattacharya, general secretary of RSP, said, \"I do not consider this an alliance between the Congress and the Left Front, this is more of an adjustment. I do not oppose the coming together of the parties. We had to pair up with another secular or like-minded party to put up a fight against the BJP and the Trinamool Congress.\"\n\nLater this month, the Left Front will hold a meeting with all its allies to discuss their losses and analyse the root causes behind the defeat. Both the AIFB and the RSP said they do not see another alliance happening between the Congress and the Left again in the near future, but that no concrete decision has been reached on the matter.\n\nRead Comments",

        "title": "Imagine there are no losers: Why 2024 is the John Lennon election",
        "body": "Nirmalya Dutta's political and economic views vaccilates from woke Leninist to Rand-Marxist to Keynesian-Friedmanite. He doesn't know what any of those terms mean. He spends the better part of his time worrying about not writing, instead of just writing. LESS ... MORE\n\nJohn Lennon, man who song the de-facto communist anthem and was shot by a mad man for preaching a life without any possessions while paying obeisance to Mammon is the subject of a delightful anecdotal story about happiness that turns up on various meme pages. The story goes that when the young working-class hero was asked what he would like to be when he grew up, he had replied: \"I just want to be happy.\"\n\nThere's absolutely no evidence to suggest that the story, like Albert Einstein's imaginary driver one, has any basis in reality but it's certainly a darn good tale. Of course, a good anecdote should never waste, and this 2024 Lok Sabha Election can be termed the John Lennon Election because everyone, after result day, has a reason to be happy, some vestige of hope that turns their frown upside down and raises their serotonin levels.\n\nTake the BJP and NDA.\n\nDespite all the bluster of divine intervention that would help them cross 400, the NDA even failed to even reach the number commonly associated with Gerard Butler's CGI abs: 300.\n\nHowever, when the dust settles, NDA supporters will remember that they are forming the government, with Modi at the helm and as far as business is concerned, very little changes. Pre-2014, if someone had offered BJP 240 seats on its own, they probably would've bitten the hand that offered it. Sure, the third NDA government will have a little less bluster and will have to learn to treat their allies with a tad more respect. Perhaps they can learn from the life lessons of former PM PV Narasimha Rao who they have appropriated.\n\nTwo NDA allies in particular have will be doing the proverbial happy dance. Namely, Nitish Kumar in Bihar (who has promised not to be a Schrodinger's cat again) and Chandrababu Naidu who was in jail 8 months ago but now is again the Chief Minister and a man with the keys to the kingdom.\n\nOn the other hand, the INDIA bloc is thrilled beyond measure, despite not winning. The Congress bolstered by power walks turned in its best performance in two decades and even wrested back its family bastion. Allahabad will again have a Congress MP and the last one was forty years ago when the KBC host was still an Angry Young Man.\n\nThe Samajwadi Party also turned in its best performance to date in a Lok Sabha election, with Akhilesh emerging as the most important ally to the Congress in the INDI bloc.\n\nAlso feeling like the cat that had its cream will be Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray, who might have lost their parties and official symbols, but still retain the voters' backing. And in the East, bolstered by Rhodes Scholars and an RTI activists, Didi still rules over her bastion of culture and old buildings where the khela is very much in her favour.\n\nAlso thrilled will be those associated with the business of elections: EVM makers, academicians, columnists, YouTubers, podcasters, and even resort owners.\n\nEspecially thrilled will be journalists, whose diets have gone for a complete toss, thanks to their culinary travels.\n\nMeme makers will be thrilled to have their favourite politicians back in Parliament, including a few new ones like Kangana Ranaut who will continue to enthral us with her pitched battle against nepotism.\n\nBut the most thrilled will be supporters of various political parties of the INDIA bloc, many of whom had believed that even the thought of the BJP losing was impossible.\n\nIf one were to check the X timelines of the supporters of various parties, one would have assumed that the INDIA bloc won the election. In fact, it's hard to remember the last time the losing team celebrated more than the winning team.\n\nBut that's one of life's quirks, where our entire worldview is always shaped by our availability heuristic, where we have to assign a reason to everything happening. That there might be no reason for our existence, that we are the product of chance and stardust seems is perhaps too much for us to comprehend. That's why we crave certitude and certainty whenever we can.\n\nThis means that elections are often treated as a referendum of our worldview. This entails retrofitting whatever we care about deigning that the party that won or lost did so because of those reasons. For example, opponents of Hindutva are convinced Modi did poorly because he's \"illiberal\" and that this is a \"secular\" pushback. Modi supporters on the other hand, attribute the loss to Modi being not hardline enough and giving too many scholarships to minorities. Critics of the regime also attributed to poor social media handling, communal statements, calling oneself a divine being, the hubris of saying one will win 400 seats, the mangalsutra statement, and the regime's tendency to attribute morality to food choices.\n\nSupporters blamed a poor social media game; a bad choice of candidates particularly in Uttar Pradesh; the reluctance of Hindus to vote, caste divisions, and lack of quality chocolate chip cookies.\n\nEither way, the desire to retrofit, is also seen in election analysis, where one first waits for the result and then shoehorn the explanation for it.\n\nOf course, why all of these great analysts, never know why someone wins beforehand and know it immediately after the result is one of life's greatest mystery.\n\nFictional philosopher Ramadhir Singh had once explained: \"Sabke dimaag mein apna apna sanima chal raha hai.\"\n\nBut just because something's happening in your head - as Dumbledore explained to Harry Potter - doesn't mean it's not real. So in this election, we guess we all are, like Camus imagined Sisyphus, happy.\n\nOr to paraphrase the lines of the big man himself: Imagine there are no losers. It's easy if you try. At least till the next election comes around.",

        "summary": "The 2024 Lok Sabha Election in India is being dubbed the \"John Lennon Election\" because, despite the results, all parties have reasons to be happy. The BJP-led NDA, although falling short of their ambitious target of 400 seats, still managed to form the government with Modi at the helm. Key allies like Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu are particularly pleased with their outcomes.\n\nOn the other hand, the opposition INDIA bloc, including Congress and the Samajwadi Party, celebrated their best performances in decades, reclaiming significant seats and bolstering their political influence. Leaders like Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, and Mamata Banerjee also found reasons to be optimistic despite setbacks.\n\nThe election has also been a boon for those involved in the electoral process, from journalists to meme makers, who now have ample material to work with. The article highlights the human tendency to find reasons for outcomes that align with personal worldviews, making everyone feel like a winner in some way.",

        "title": "Rashtriya Janata Dal gets highest vote share among parties in Bihar, while winning only four seats; 20 MPs from OBC, EBC groups",
        "body": "The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) won only four out of the 40 Lok Sabha seats from Bihar, but the party got a vote share of 22.14%, the highest among all political parties in the State. It was followed by the BJP with 20.52% and the Janata Dal (United) with 18.52%, though both these parties were able to convert their vote shares into 12 seats each. In the last Lok Sabha election in 2019, the RJD had got 15.68% of votes, while the BJP had a 23.57% vote share.\n\nElection Results 2024 LIVE updates: \"Mandate is decisively against Narendra Modi and the substance and style of his politics,\" says Mallikarjun Kharge\n\nOf the 40 winning candidates in the 2024 election, half are from other backward class (OBC) and extremely backward class (EBC) communities, which make up 63% of the State's population, according to the recent caste survey. Of the 13 OBC MPs, seven are from the Yadav caste. Six MPs are from the Dalit community, all from reserved seats. Among the 12 upper caste MPs, six are Rajputs and three are from the Bhumihar caste. Two MPs are Muslims. All mainstream political parties had fielded candidates, keeping in mind the caste calculus of various constituencies.\n\nNarrowing the gap\n\nWithin the Opposition mahagathbandhan (grand alliance), the RJD's vote share was more than seven percentage points higher than in the last general election when the party had failed to win any seats. With its 22% vote share this time round, it won only the four seats of Aurangabad, Jehanabad, Buxar, and Patliputra. Its alliance partner, the Congress, received 9.2% of votes, winning three seats in Kishanganj, Katihar, and Sasaram.\n\nThe three Left parties together got less than 5% of votes -- 2.99% for the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), 1.31% for the Communist Party of India, and 0.87% for the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Out of the five seats they contested, the Left parties won two seats in Karakat and Ara, both going to the CPI-ML. Other parties and Independents together garnered the remaining 13.29% votes in Bihar.\n\nLok Sabha results and voting trends\n\nAmong NDA allies, the BJP got a 20.52% vote share, followed by the JD(U) with 18.52%, and the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) with 6.43%.. Together, the NDA got a 45.52% vote share in Bihar, while the mahagathbandhan got 36.47%. In 2019, NDA's vote share was 22.49 percentage points higher than the mahagathbandhan; this time, the gap has narrowed to nine percentage points.\n\nFor the BJP in Bihar, its best results in decades came in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, when the party had contested 30 seats -- without a poll alliance with the JD(U) -- and won 22 with a 29.86% vote share. In 2024, as part of the NDA, the JD(U) contested 16 seats, winning 12, the same number of seats won by its ally, the BJP.\n\nRead Comments",

The directive is aimed to ensure that a more robust, transparent, and reliable mechanism is followed for the assessment process in the exams.\n\nThe decision comes as the board found significant variation in the marks of 50 per cent students in over 500 schools. The variation of the marks was seen in theory and practical subjects. Following this, the board directed the schools to review their internal assessment procedures.\n\nNews agency PTI has noted that the schools have been advised to prioritise fairness and accuracy in assessing practical examinations and ensuring the process is realistic and adds substantial value to students' academic journey.\n\n\"The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has detected, through advanced AI tools, a significant variation between theory and practical marks in certain subjects among 50 per cent or more students in about 500 CBSE-affiliated schools, based on past years' result statistics,\" PTI quoted CBSE secretary Himanshu Gupta.\n\n\"This variance highlights a need for meticulous assessment during practical examinations in schools. Consequently, the Board has issued an advisory to such schools to review their internal assessment procedures,\" he added.\n\n\"This advisory serves as a reminder to prioritize fairness and accuracy in assessing practical examinations, thereby enhancing the quality of education imparted in CBSE-affiliated institutions,\" he said.\n\nThe board had recently also announced a modification to its class size limitations, aiming to better accommodate students joining mid-year and those needing to repeat a grade.\n\nSchools can now have up to 45 students per section for mid-year admissions due to parental transfers and students requiring an essential repeat.\n\nShow full article\n\nIndia Elections | Read Latest News on Lok Sabha Elections 2024 Live on NDTV.com.

        "body": "Hyderabad [Pakistan], June 5 (ANI): The death toll from the tragic May 30 Paretabad LPG cylinder blast and fire incident climbed to 18 as four more individuals succumbed to their burns, Dawn reported.\n\nAmong the latest casualties are 17-year-old Alisha, the daughter of Zeeshan; 15-year-old Umair, son of Arshad; 14-year-old Abbas Ali, son of Mubarak; and 25-year-old Doda, son of Mehar Bagri.\n\nAlso Read | Latin America's Anger at China's Economic Clout Grows.\n\nZeeshan, who had already lost his son, Mohammad Hassan alias Ali Hyder, in the same calamity, now mourns the loss of his daughter. His five-year-old daughter, Kinza, remains hospitalised at the Civil Hospital Karachi with burns covering 29 per cent of her body, as reported by Dawn.\n\nMeanwhile, Deputy Commissioner Zain Ul Abedin Memon has called upon the senior executive director (LPG) and the senior executive director (enforcement) of the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) to take decisive action against illegal decanting points of LPG and CNG filling stations in Hyderabad.\n\nAlso Read | Lok Sabha Election Results 2024: French President Emmanuel Macron Congratulates 'Dear Friend' PM Narendra Modi on Historic Win, Hails Strategic Partnership With India.\n\nIn correspondence dated June 1, the DC has pledged full cooperation and coordination from the district administration and police to assist Ogra and its enforcement teams in achieving their objectives. He highlighted that many LPG shops and sale points were operating without the necessary permissions or NOCs.\n\nAdditionally, the DC has forwarded another letter through the Hyderabad commissioner to the home secretary, urging action against all such unlawful outlets, Dawn reported.\n\nThe cylinder blast and fire incident, which tragically claimed numerous lives, predominantly children, once again exposes the vulnerabilities and limitations of Liaquat University Hospital's burns ward.\n\nThe burns ward at LUH serves not only the healthcare needs of Hyderabad residents but also those from neighbouring districts in lower Sindh. However, it appears that the ward itself is struggling to survive.\n\nDespite the completion of the construction of a multi-story building, the burns ward lacks a crucial component: a dedicated intensive care unit (ICU) for burns patients. Other essential components, despite being outlined in documents such as the project cost estimate (PC-I) initiated during Dr SM Tahir's tenure, are absent.\n\nThe unit has been operating under temporary arrangements for an extended period. Approximately two decades ago, it operated in a building deemed unsafe for habitation. Subsequently, it was relocated to a two-story structure consisting of outdated private wards.\n\nDr Tahir, who served with the burns unit from 2000 to 2018, expressed concerns about the adequacy of treatment in such an environment for burn victims when the unit was transferred to the old private wards building, Dawn reported.

        "title": "Special Category Status for AP: Chandrababu Naidu's big demand and the BJP's compulsions",
        "body": "In 1969, the Fifth Finance Commission of India introduced the mechanism of SCS to assist certain states in their development and fast-tracking growth if they faced historical economic or geographical disadvantages. Factors such as difficult and hilly terrain, low population density and/ or a sizable tribal population, strategic location along borders, economic and infrastructural backwardness, and non-viable nature of state finances were typically considered to accord SCS.\n\nThe system was scrapped on the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission, which suggested that the resource gap of the states should be filled by increasing the devolution of tax to 42% from the existing 32%.\n\nSCS was accorded to 11 states, including the entire Northeast, and the border hill states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. Subsequently, other states too demanded SCS -- including Naidu's AP; Bihar, whose Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is another key NDA ally; and Odisha, where the BJP will now form the government.\n\nWhy does AP want Special Category Status?\n\nWhen undivided AP was bifurcated to create Telangana in 2014 through the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, the UPA government at the Centre had promised to grant SCS to AP to compensate for the loss of revenue, and of Hyderabad, where much of the development was concentrated.\n\nAfter the Narendra Modi government took charge, both Naidu who was CM from 2014 to 2019, and Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy who was CM from 2019 to 2024, repeatedly appealed for SCS, so more funds were made available from the Centre to overcome the \"distressing\" financial situation of the state.\n\nAs per presentations made by the AP government to NITI Aayog, the body that succeeded the Planning Commission, the 14th Finance Commission estimated that the post-devolution revenue deficit for AP for the five-year period 2015-20 would be Rs 22,113 crore, but in reality, this figure stood at Rs 66,362 crore. The debt of the residuary state, which was Rs 97,000 crore at the time of bifurcation, reached Rs 2,58,928 crore by 2018-19, and is more than Rs 3.5 lakh crore now.\n\nAP argues that the undivided state was bifurcated in an unjust and inequitable manner -- the successor state inherited nearly 59% of the population, debt, and liabilities of the original state, but only 47% of its revenues. For example, of the Rs 57,000 crore of software exports from AP for the year 2013-14, Hyderabad city -- with Telangana after the bifurcation -- alone accounted for Rs 56,500 crore.\n\nToday's AP is essentially an agrarian state, with low economic buoyancy, leading to huge revenue disabilities. This is evident from the fact that the per capita revenue of Telangana for 2015-16 was Rs 14,411, while it was only Rs 8,397 for AP.\n\nAccording to the AP government, the UPA had assured the nation, and especially the people of AP, that it would be granted SCS for a five-year period as a precondition to bifurcation, and that the residuary state would be adequately compensated through a number of development interventions, investments, and direct financial assistance.\n\nAnd what would SCS mean for AP?\n\nSCS would mean higher grants-in-aid to the state government from the Centre. To illustrate, per capita grants to Special Category States is Rs 5,573 crore per year, whereas AP receives only Rs 3,428 crore.\n\nSCS states enjoy special industrial incentives such as Income-tax exemptions, custom duty waivers, reduced excise duty, corporate tax exemption for a certain period, concessions and exemptions relating to GST, and lower state and central taxes.\n\nIn SCS states, the Centre funds central schemes up to 90%, compared to 70% in non-SCS states.\n\nGovernments of AP have argued that such special incentives are vital for the rapid industrialisation of the primarily agrarian state, and would lead to improved employment opportunities for the youth and overall development of the state.\n\nGranting SCS would encourage investments in specialty hospitals, five-star hotels, manufacturing industries, high-value service industries such as IT, and premier institutions of higher education and research, AP has argued.\n\nWhat has the AP government done to press its demand with the Centre?\n\nNaidu has been vocal and emotional about SCS, and it vexed him through his 2014-19 tenure as Chief Minister. The TDP was part of the first Modi government when it took power in 2014, and Naidu was frustrated by his failure to persuade the Centre of his case.\n\nIn March 2018, expressing anguish over the Centre's refusal to listen to his pleas, Naidu asked his two ministers at the Centre -- P Ashok Gajapati Raju (Civil Aviation) and Y Satyanarayana Chowdary (MoS, Science and Technology and Earth Sciences) -- to resign. He then quit the NDA and launched an anti-BJP, anti-Modi campaign for the Assembly election of May 2019.\n\nWhen Naidu mentioned in the Legislative Assembly that he had gone to Delhi 29 times to meet NDA ministers to seek SCS, Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and his YSRCP MLAs had laughed and poked fun at him. During the election campaign, Jagan attacked Naidu and TDP for their failure to get SCS for AP. However, after winning a landslide and becoming the Chief Minister in 2019, Jagan faced those same attacks and insults himself.\n\nIn February 2024, during the last Assembly session before the elections, Jagan expressed frustration and anguish over the issue, telling the Assembly that he wished that no party gets an absolute majority in Lok Sabha, so that the state can bargain for SCS. Naidu now has exactly that opportunity.\n\nBut how feasible is it for the Centre to yield to this demand?\n\nThe BJP has fallen short on numbers, and has very few options in its negotiations with Naidu, should he choose to play hardball. The Congress has already sent him feelers -- senior leader Jairam Ramesh has said that SCS for AP was part of the party's manifesto in the state, and the INDIA bloc would accept the demand if it comes to power at the Centre.\n\nGiving Naidu what he wants to the exclusion of other states -- notably Bihar and Odisha -- will be difficult for the BJP. Also, the 14th Finance Commission had stated that SCS was a burden on the Centre's resources -- this has been used by the NDA to reject Naidu's pleas since 2014.\n\nAs a compromise, the NDA could make a promise similar to the one the UPA made: to give SCS for a specific period -- say, five years. The UPA had hoped that would assuage the anger of the people and create some breathing space; however, the BJP will be mindful that the Congress has not won a single MLA or MP seat in AP since 2014.\n\nNaidu's earlier push for SCS had failed, and he had suffered a crushing defeat in the state as well. This time is different -- the BJP is dependent on him, and he has just won a landslide in the state. From his position of strength, he could settle for a compromise with favourable terms -- perhaps several Central projects in AP, a halt to the privatisation of the Vizag steel plant, increased assistance to backward districts, setting up of SEZs where the Centre would be able to waive taxes, etc.\n\nAll this could be in addition to ministerial portfolios of his choice in the new Modi government.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the demand for Special Category Status (SCS) for Andhra Pradesh (AP) by its former Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and the political complexities surrounding it. SCS was initially introduced in 1969 to aid states with economic or geographical disadvantages but was scrapped based on the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations. AP's demand for SCS stems from the financial challenges it faced post-bifurcation in 2014, which led to the creation of Telangana. The bifurcation resulted in significant revenue loss for AP, particularly from Hyderabad, a major economic hub.\n\nBoth Naidu and his successor, Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, have repeatedly appealed for SCS to address AP's financial distress. The state argues that it inherited a disproportionate share of debt and liabilities compared to its revenues. SCS would provide AP with higher grants, industrial incentives, and greater central funding for schemes, which are crucial for its development and industrialization.\n\nNaidu's efforts to secure SCS during his tenure from 2014 to 2019 included resigning from the NDA and launching an anti-BJP campaign. Despite his efforts, he failed to secure SCS, leading to political attacks from Jagan, who faced similar challenges after becoming CM in 2019.\n\nWith the BJP now lacking a majority, Naidu has a stronger negotiating position. The Congress has indicated support for SCS for AP, complicating the BJP's stance. The BJP might consider a compromise, such as granting SCS for a limited period or offering other concessions like central projects and tax incentives. Naidu's current political strength could enable him to secure favorable terms from the Centre.",

        "summary": "The Trinamool Congress (TMC) has scheduled a meeting for its newly elected MPs at Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's residence in Kolkata on Saturday at 4 pm. This follows the recent Lok Sabha elections where TMC secured 29 out of 42 seats in West Bengal, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 12 seats, a decrease from their previous 18 seats in 2019. Mamata Banerjee has called for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's resignation, citing his failure to achieve the 400 seats he had promised. The BJP's campaign aimed to unseat Banerjee but was unsuccessful. The meeting is likely to discuss the election outcomes and future strategies.",

The pitch has been under scrutiny due to its uneven bounce, which has made batting challenging and favored fast bowlers, leading to low-scoring games. Sharma mentioned the uncertainty about which of the four pitches will be used for their game and emphasized the need for the team to adapt quickly to the conditions. He also highlighted concerns about the outfield and the importance of both batting and bowling strategies in such conditions. The Indian team had previously played a practice match against Bangladesh at the same venue.",

Despite not achieving a majority on its own, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured a total of 292 seats. The opposition's INDIA alliance, comprising 20 parties, won 234 seats, with the Congress party securing 99 seats, making it the second-largest party. This election marks the first time under Narendra Modi's leadership that the BJP did not achieve a majority independently, unlike in 2014 and 2019.

The revelation came when the spouse refused to register the marriage, leading AK to investigate further. It was found that Aish had been posing as a woman since 2020 to scam people. The police have registered a case of fraud against Aish and are conducting further investigations. This incident has caused significant shock and highlights the potential dangers of online relationships.",

        "summary": "In the wake of the 2024 Lok Sabha election results, Maharashtra's Deputy Chief Minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis has expressed his desire to resign from his position, taking full responsibility for the party's poor performance in the state. The BJP won only 9 out of 48 seats in Maharashtra, while its allies Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction) and NCP (Ajit Pawar faction) secured 7 and 1 seat respectively. The NDA coalition managed to win only 17 seats, whereas the INDIA bloc won 30 seats.\n\nFadnavis thanked the public for re-electing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister but acknowledged the disappointing results in Maharashtra. He mentioned that despite the losses, the vote share was nearly the same as the opposition's. He also noted that a party meeting was held to discuss the results, with plans for further discussions involving Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar.\n\nHowever, Maharashtra BJP President Chandrashekhar Bawankule stated that the party does not intend to relieve Fadnavis of his duties. He suggested that Fadnavis could balance his time between the government and party work. Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan also mentioned that no decision was made in the core committee meeting regarding Fadnavis's resignation.",

INDIA secured 234 seats, with Congress winning 99 of them, nearly doubling its previous count. Congress's vote share increased by 2.5% compared to 2019, reaching 21.2%, while the BJP's vote share decreased by 1.1%. In 2019, Congress had 52 seats with a 19.67% vote share. The BJP, despite a 1.1% drop in vote share from 2019, saw a significant reduction of 63 seats, down from 303 in 2019 to fewer seats in 2024. The 2019 elections were the best for BJP in terms of both vote share and seat count.",

Dhankhar congratulated Modi and presented him with a special bouquet containing three lotus flowers symbolizing his third term. Additionally, Dhankhar offered Modi traditional sweets from Rajasthan and Meerut. Modi resigned from his current term and recommended the dissolution of the cabinet, with plans to take the oath for his third term on June 8. The BJP secured 240 seats, falling short of the majority mark, while the NDA coalition achieved 292 seats. The opposition alliance INDIA won 234 seats. Key regional leaders like Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar are now crucial for the NDA government.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP fell short of a majority but the NDA managed to secure 292 seats, surpassing the 272-seat threshold. The INDIA alliance won 234 seats. Following the election results, Bihar BJP President Samrat Choudhary praised Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, acknowledging his leadership in securing NDA's seats in Bihar and calling him the state's biggest leader. Political activities have intensified in Bihar, with Nitish Kumar holding a meeting at the CM residence before heading to Delhi. Leaders like Lalan Singh, Ashok Choudhary, and LJP(R) chief Chirag Paswan attended the meeting. Chirag Paswan expressed congratulations and mentioned that Narendra Modi is set to become Prime Minister for the third time. The article also raises the question of whether the INDIA alliance could form a government with support from Nitish Kumar, Naidu, and independents.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, no single party has secured a majority, but the NDA alliance has enough seats to form a government. The formation of the new government hinges on the support of JDU leader Nitish Kumar and TDP leader Chandrababu Naidu, who could align with either the NDA or the India alliance. This pivotal role has led to a surge of memes about the two leaders on social media. Key meetings are taking place in Delhi, with major leaders like Amit Shah, Nitish Kumar, and Chandrababu Naidu discussing future strategies and cabinet formation. The India alliance, despite securing over 200 seats, has limited options compared to the NDA's clear majority.",

Currently in the U.S., Grover posted a picture of the Statue of Liberty and praised the Indian electorate's wisdom, stating that the public is more discerning than politicians. He emphasized that the results reaffirm India's parliamentary democracy, where MPs are chosen rather than a Prime Minister. His post went viral, receiving mixed reactions from social media users, with many agreeing with his views.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the aftermath of the 2024 Lok Sabha election results in India, where the BJP emerged as the largest party, but the NDA alliance faced significant losses. The INDIA alliance performed well, winning 234 seats, while the NDA secured 293 seats. Despite this, forming a government remains challenging, with meetings scheduled for June 5 in Delhi.\n\nKey figures, Bihar leaders Tejashwi Yadav (RJD) and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar (JDU), were seen traveling together on the same flight to Delhi, sparking speculation and viral reactions on social media. This has led to rumors that Nitish Kumar might switch alliances from NDA to INDIA. Tejashwi commented on the diminishing 'Modi factor' and expressed surprise at sharing the flight with Nitish. The article highlights the political uncertainty and potential shifts in alliances following the election results.",

The INDIA alliance won 234 seats. Attention is now on Nitish Kumar and TDP's Chandrababu Naidu, as the INDIA alliance may seek their support to form a government. The INDIA alliance needs 38 more seats to reach the majority. With TDP and JDU's combined 28 seats, they still need 10 more, making the remaining 17 independent MPs crucial. The INDIA alliance will likely try to garner support from these MPs.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) increased its vote share to 45.77%, up from 43.7% in 2019, securing 29 out of 42 seats, an increase of seven seats. In contrast, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) saw a decline in its vote share to 38.73% from 40.6% in 2019, resulting in a loss of six seats, bringing their total to 12 seats. This outcome defied exit poll predictions, which had forecasted a significant drop in TMC's vote share. The results indicate a shift in voter preference in West Bengal, with TMC gaining ground at the expense of BJP.",

        "summary": "In the wake of the 2024 Lok Sabha election results, political activities in Delhi have intensified as preparations for forming the new government are underway. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fell short of the majority mark of 272 seats, securing only 240 seats, which is 32 seats less than needed. However, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Narendra Modi, is set to form the government for the third time with a total of 291 seats. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Janata Dal (United) (JD-U) are crucial allies, winning 16 and 12 seats respectively. The Congress party and the INDIA alliance saw significant gains, with Congress doubling its seats to 99 and the Samajwadi Party (SP) achieving its best performance with 37 seats under Akhilesh Yadav's leadership. Political maneuvers and statements from various parties are creating suspense as the government formation process continues.",

Both leaders are attending different political meetings in Delhi\u2014Nitish for an NDA meeting and Tejashwi for an INDIA bloc meeting. The video has intrigued the public, especially after the 2024 Lok Sabha election results where the BJP won 240 seats, and the NDA secured a majority with 292 seats. However, the BJP needs the support of Chandrababu Naidu's TDP (15 seats) and Nitish Kumar's JDU (12 seats) to form the government, as it falls short of the majority on its own.",

Bollywood actress Neha Sharma's father, Ajit Sharma, contested from the Bhagalpur seat as a Congress candidate but was defeated by a JD(U) candidate. Neha Sharma expressed her disappointment on Instagram, stating that although it was a tough day, her family is ready for the next chapter. She thanked those who supported her father and emphasized that true victory lies in continuing to move forward. Neha had actively campaigned for her father in Bhagalpur.",

        "summary": "In the lead-up to the 2024 elections, there is speculation about whether Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will support the NDA or the opposition alliance 'INDIA'. On June 5, 2023, Nitish Kumar traveled from Patna to Delhi to attend an NDA meeting. Accompanying him on the flight was Tejashwi Yadav, who sat behind Kumar and shared smiles with him. When approached by an ABP News correspondent for comments on the upcoming Lok Sabha election results, both leaders refrained from making any statements. However, Kumar did inquire about Yadav's health during the flight. The interaction has fueled further curiosity about Kumar's political stance in the upcoming elections.",

        "summary": "In the recent 2024 Lok Sabha election results, the ruling NDA coalition secured a majority, but the BJP fell short of an absolute majority. The opposition alliance, INDIA, gained significant strength with 234 seats, boosting their morale. Tejashwi Yadav, former Chief Minister of Bihar and RJD leader, expressed optimism about forming a government, suggesting that a faction from the NDA might join them, providing an opportunity for the INDIA alliance to establish power at the center.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nIn the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is set to form the next government, despite the BJP falling short of an outright majority with 240 seats. The NDA, with a total of 293 seats, will rely on support from allies like the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Janata Dal (United) (JDU), who are expected to submit their support letters to the BJP in Delhi. Key leaders, including Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and TDP President Chandrababu Naidu, will meet to discuss government formation and congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his anticipated third term. Meanwhile, the opposition alliance INDIA, buoyed by strong performances from the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh and the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, has secured 232 seats, with Congress increasing its tally to 99 seats. Both alliances are holding crucial meetings to strategize their next steps.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA secured 292 seats while the INDIA alliance won 234 seats. The BJP fell short of a majority. Bhojpuri actor Pawan Singh, who contested as an independent candidate from the Karakat constituency, lost the election. His wife, Jyoti Singh, campaigned extensively for him, but despite their efforts, Pawan Singh was defeated by CPI (ML) candidate Raja Ram Singh, who received 318,730 votes compared to Pawan Singh's 226,474 votes. Jyoti Singh expressed on Instagram that although her husband lost, his spirit remains unbroken. The close contest between Pawan Singh and Upendra Kushwaha, who came third, is believed to have benefited the INDIA alliance.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP fell short of a majority, securing 292 seats, while the INDIA alliance won 234 seats. Key figures from the INDIA alliance played crucial roles in preventing Prime Minister Modi from achieving a majority. \n\nAkhilesh Yadav's strategic moves in Uttar Pradesh significantly hindered the BJP, limiting them to 33 out of 80 seats. Rahul Gandhi's initiatives, including the Bharat Jodo Yatra and Nyay Yatra, helped the Congress secure 99 seats, an improvement from previous elections. Other influential leaders such as Sharad Pawar, Mamata Banerjee, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Priyanka Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, Jairam Ramesh, Uddhav Thackeray, Sitaram Yechury, and Pawan Khera also contributed to the INDIA alliance's success in curbing Modi's momentum.",

The INDIA alliance won 232 seats. This outcome presents several challenges for Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the next five years:\n\n1. **Maintaining Coalition Unity:** Without a majority, Modi must prioritize keeping the coalition united, considering the interests of allies like Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu.\n2. **Managing Ally Expectations:** Allies will demand more, especially on issues like special state status for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.\n3. **Ideological Differences:** The BJP's differing ideologies with its allies may slow down decisions on contentious issues like the Common Civil Code.\n4. **Policy Implementation:** Modi's government needs to effectively implement policies to regain its previous momentum.\n5. **Upcoming State Elections:** The BJP faces pressure to perform well in upcoming state elections in Maharashtra, Delhi, and Haryana.\n\nThese challenges highlight the complexities Modi will face in governing with a coalition and the need for strategic adjustments.",

        "summary": "The results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections have been announced. The BJP-led NDA has secured a majority with 292 seats, while the INDIA bloc has won 233 seats. The BJP emerged as the largest party with 240 seats, whereas Congress fell just short of 100, securing 99 seats. This outcome indicates that Narendra Modi is set to form the government once again. Key figures like Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu are expected to play significant roles in the new government. Important meetings of both the NDA and INDIA alliances are scheduled to outline the formation of the next government.",

        "summary": "In the recent 2024 Indian general elections, exit polls have once again proven inaccurate. Despite predictions of a strong wave in favor of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP, the party failed to secure a majority on its own and will need coalition partners to form a government. This discrepancy highlights the unreliable nature of exit polls, which had previously failed in 2004 and 2009 but were accurate in 2014 and 2019.\n\nKey exit polls, including those by Axis My India, C Voter, and Today Chanakya, had forecasted the NDA winning between 350 to 400 seats, but the actual results fell short by about 100 seats. The I.N.D.I.A. coalition performed better than expected in states like West Bengal, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan, contrary to exit poll predictions. The BJP's performance in Uttar Pradesh was also weaker than anticipated.\n\nThis outcome underscores the limitations of exit polls and the challenges in accurately predicting election results.",

        "summary": "The results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections have been announced, with the NDA securing a full majority. Following the announcement, several foreign leaders have congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi and expressed a desire to strengthen relations with India. Key congratulatory messages include:\n\n1. **Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth**: He congratulated PM Modi on his historic third term and expressed hope for continued progress and strong Mauritius-India relations. PM Modi thanked him and emphasized the importance of their partnership.\n\n2. **Shering Tobgay**: He congratulated PM Modi and the NDA on their historic win and expressed eagerness to work together to strengthen India-Bhutan relations. PM Modi responded with gratitude and optimism for ongoing strong ties.\n\nThe election results show the NDA winning 292 out of 542 seats, while the I.N.D.I.A alliance secured 233 seats. Although the BJP did not achieve the majority on its own, the NDA's overall majority allows them to form the government. This marks a significant political outcome, with the BJP previously winning 278 seats in 2014 and 303 seats in 2019.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nIn the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP faced a significant setback in Uttar Pradesh despite efforts to replicate their 2014 and 2019 successes. The party had incorporated several leaders from other parties, including more than half a dozen Samajwadi Party (SP) MLAs, to strengthen their position. Notable SP defectors included Rakesh Pandey, Rakesh Pratap Singh, Abhay Singh, Manoj Pandey, Vinod Chaturvedi, Pooja Pal, and Ashutosh Maurya, who had previously cross-voted for the BJP in the Rajya Sabha elections. Additionally, BJP fielded former Congress member RPN Singh for the Rajya Sabha and Jitin Prasada for the Lok Sabha, and also brought back former MLC Yashwant and supported strongman Dhananjay Singh. However, these strategies did not yield the expected results, leading to BJP's poor performance in the state.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nIn the 2024 election results, experts predict that Narendra Modi's stature on the global stage will rise significantly as he secures a third consecutive term as India's Prime Minister. Under Modi's leadership, India has positioned itself as a leader of the Global South and is pushing for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Relations with the US and Europe are expected to strengthen, with significant defense deals and strategic partnerships in place. Despite tensions with China, trade relations remain robust, and Modi aims to curb China's aggression with the help of allies. Modi's tenure is also marked by strong ties with Russia, avoiding condemnation of its actions in Ukraine, and maintaining a significant defense relationship. Relations with Pakistan remain strained, with little progress expected. Modi's leadership has garnered praise from international leaders and organizations, highlighting India's democratic process.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress party has made significant gains, with Rahul Gandhi winning both the Wayanad and Rae Bareli seats. Rahul expressed gratitude to the voters of both constituencies via a Twitter video, stating his preference to serve as MP for both if possible. He won Rae Bareli by over 400,000 votes and Wayanad by 364,422 votes, defeating CPI leader Annie Raja in Wayanad.\n\nThe Wayanad constituency has a diverse voter base, including 3% Scheduled Castes, 9.5% Scheduled Tribes, 32% Muslims, and 13% Christians.\n\nThe election results show the NDA alliance securing 291 seats, while the INDIA bloc won 234 seats. The BJP remains the largest party for the third consecutive term with 240 seats, although it did not achieve an outright majority this time. The opposition's INDIA alliance, comprising 20 parties, has significantly strengthened its position.",

However, the BJP has not secured a majority on its own, winning 291 seats, and will need to rely on coalition partners. The opposition alliance, INDIA, has won 234 seats. This marks a decrease for the BJP, which won 278 seats in 2014 and 303 in 2019. Narendra Modi will become the second leader after Nehru to serve as Prime Minister for a third term. The NDA is expected to stake its claim to form the government on Wednesday, with a meeting of coalition partners scheduled, including Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and TDP leader Chandrababu Naidu.",

        "summary": "The 2024 Lok Sabha election results in India have surprised many. The NDA coalition, led by the BJP, failed to achieve its goal of winning over 400 seats, securing around 295+ seats instead. The opposition INDIA alliance made significant gains, winning 231+ seats. The BJP alone did not reach the majority mark, winning 240 seats, while the Congress secured 100 seats.\n\nKey figures include Rahul Gandhi, who won decisively in Wayanad and Raebareli, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who secured his third consecutive win in Varanasi. The BJP faced setbacks in Uttar Pradesh, winning only 35 seats, with the Samajwadi Party, led by Akhilesh Yadav, making significant inroads.\n\nIn Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of the JD(U) and N. Chandrababu Naidu of the TDP emerged as potential kingmakers. The TDP won 16 seats, and the JD(U) matched the BJP's 12 seats in Bihar. Reports suggest that INDIA alliance leaders are reaching out to these key figures to form a majority, though this has not been confirmed by the Congress.\n\nImportant meetings are scheduled for June 5 in Delhi, including those of the INDIA alliance and the NDA. The central cabinet is also expected to meet, and preparations for the new government's swearing-in ceremony, likely on June 9, will begin.",

        "summary": "The 2024 Lok Sabha election results are nearly finalized, with the NDA, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, set to form the government for a third term. However, the BJP did not secure a majority on its own, winning 291 seats, thus relying on coalition partners. The opposition alliance, INDIA, won 234 seats. Modi, re-elected as an MP from Varanasi, will be the second leader after Nehru to serve three terms as Prime Minister.\n\nKey points include:\n1. The BJP's need to depend on coalition partners due to not achieving a simple majority.\n2. The historical significance of Modi's third term and the strategic role of allies like Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu.\n3. The election results reflect a mandate for continuity and stability, despite the BJP's reduced majority.\n4. The opposition's failure to capitalize on opportunities due to internal contradictions and lack of a strong narrative.\n\nThe article emphasizes the importance of flexibility and coalition management for the Modi government and highlights lessons for the opposition in terms of strategy and unity.",

The INDIA Alliance is giving a tough competition to the NDA, making it clear that the BJP cannot form the government on its own. All eyes are now on Nitish Kumar, as there is speculation that he might switch sides again, which could significantly influence the formation of the new government.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 UP Lok Sabha elections, Congress candidate Kishori Lal Sharma won the high-profile Amethi seat, defeating BJP's Smriti Irani by 167,196 votes. This victory was unexpected as Irani had previously defeated Rahul Gandhi in 2019. Sharma received 539,228 votes, while Irani got 372,032 votes. After his win, Sharma became emotional, recalling former PM Rajiv Gandhi and attributing the victory to the efforts of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi. Smriti Irani expressed gratitude to BJP workers and leaders, including PM Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath, and vowed to continue serving Amethi. This election marked a significant shift, with Rahul Gandhi not contesting from Amethi but winning from Rae Bareli instead.",

        "summary": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed party workers following the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where the NDA appears to have secured a majority. Modi expressed gratitude for the public mandate and emotionally remembered his late mother, stating that the women of India filled the void left by her passing. He highlighted the significant voter turnout among women and their support.\n\nModi declared the victory as a triumph for democracy, the Indian Constitution, and the vision of a developed India. He praised the dedication of party workers and mentioned former Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar.\n\nThe NDA also achieved substantial victories in various state assembly elections, including Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, where the Congress party faced significant losses. Modi noted the BJP's historic win in Odisha and a seat in Kerala, acknowledging the sacrifices and efforts of party workers in these regions. The BJP also saw increased support in Telangana.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-led NDA coalition is leading but performing weaker than its pre-election claims, while the opposition INDIA alliance has shown a strong performance. The BJP's vote share has decreased from 37.36% in 2019 to an estimated 36.77%, whereas Congress has increased its vote share from 19.49% to 21.82%. The BJP is leading in only 32 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, down from 62 in 2019, and the TMC is leading in 31 seats in West Bengal, up from 22. Congress has improved its seat count from 52 in 2019 to over 100. Out of 543 seats, 542 have been counted, with the NDA leading in over 290 seats, but the BJP alone is short of the 272 majority mark. The INDIA alliance is ahead in 233 seats. PM Modi is expected to address the nation at 8 PM.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, BJP candidate Praveen Khandelwal won the Chandni Chowk seat in Delhi, defeating Congress's JP Agarwal in a close contest. This marks BJP's third consecutive victory in this constituency and a hat-trick of wins across all seven Delhi seats. Khandelwal, a first-time MP candidate, secured 516,496 votes against Agarwal's 427,171, winning by a margin of 89,325 votes. Notably, the victory margin was significantly reduced compared to the previous election, where BJP won by over 200,000 votes.\n\nJP Agarwal, aged 79, was the oldest candidate in Delhi and had previously won the Chandni Chowk seat three times (1984, 1989, 1996) but lost in 2019. In the 2019 elections, BJP's Harsh Vardhan won the seat in a triangular contest against Agarwal and AAP's Pankaj Kumar Gupta with a 2.28 lakh vote margin. This time, Congress and AAP contested under the INDIA alliance.\n\nPost-victory, Khandelwal expressed his commitment to working for the people, focusing on simplifying GST, training traders in technology, developing JJ colonies, and improving market infrastructure. Chandni Chowk constituency has over 1.6 million voters and includes ten assembly segments: Model Town, Tri Nagar, Shakur Basti, Shalimar Bagh, Adarsh Nagar, Chandni Chowk, Sadar Bazar, Ballimaran, Wazirpur, and Matia Mahal.",

        "summary": "Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde has stated that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) suffered losses in several seats due to the opposition's propaganda and delays in announcing candidates. As the vote counting for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections nears its final stages, the NDA is leading in over 290 seats, while the INDIA alliance is ahead in more than 220 seats. Shinde attributed the losses to the opposition's misinformation about constitutional changes and the NDA's delayed candidate announcements. He also mentioned that vote bank politics negatively impacted the NDA's performance. Specific instances include the Nasik Lok Sabha seat and changes in candidates for Hingoli and Yavatmal-Washim constituencies, where the party's candidates are trailing.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha election trends, the NDA appears to be heading towards a majority, but the INDIA alliance is providing stiff competition. On the New Delhi Lok Sabha seat, BJP candidate Bansuri Swaraj, daughter of former Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, is leading with 403,438 votes. Her main competitor, AAP's Somnath Bharti from the INDIA alliance, has garnered 339,607 votes, while BSP's Raj Kumar Anand is in third place with 5,073 votes. Bansuri Swaraj replaced the current BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi for this seat. The BJP has introduced new candidates for six out of seven seats in Delhi, with only Manoj Tiwari being repeated from the 2019 elections. The INDIA alliance fielded Somnath Bharti for New Delhi, along with other candidates for different seats, including Mahabal Mishra, Sahi Ram Pehalwan, and Kanhaiya Kumar.",

The BJP-led NDA has secured over 290 seats but has fallen short of a majority on its own, which requires 272 seats. The opposition's INDIA alliance, led by Congress, has won 233 seats. Despite losses in key states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, and West Bengal, the NDA is expected to form the government. Narendra Modi has won his seat in Varanasi by a significant margin, making his third term as Prime Minister likely. Modi is scheduled to address the BJP headquarters at 8 PM. He has already posted on social media, expressing gratitude for the public's trust in the NDA. Key opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee, have criticized Modi, with Banerjee calling for his resignation.",

        "summary": "The 2024 Lok Sabha election results are nearly finalized, with the NDA leading in over 290 seats and the INDIA alliance ahead in more than 220 seats. Notably, several candidates won by very narrow margins. The closest victory was in Kerala's Attingal constituency, where the Congress candidate won by just 232 votes. In Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar, the BJP candidate defeated the SP candidate by 734 votes. Other close wins include BJP candidates in Uttar Pradesh's Salempur (783 votes) and Congress and Shiv Sena candidates in Mumbai North-Central (793 votes) and Mumbai North-West (1333 votes), respectively.\n\nMaharashtra's Chief Minister Eknath Shinde attributed some losses to the opposition's propaganda about constitutional changes and delays in candidate announcements. He mentioned that vote-bank politics negatively impacted the NDA's performance, citing the example of the Nashik seat and changes in candidates for Hingoli and Yavatmal-Washim constituencies.\n\nThe article also references other political dynamics and outcomes, including the performance of various parties and candidates in different regions.",

        "summary": "Former Indian cricketer Yusuf Pathan has made a significant impact in his political debut by winning the Lok Sabha seat from Baharampur in West Bengal, defeating long-time Congress incumbent Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. Pathan, running on a TMC ticket, secured 5,22,974 votes (37.92%), while Chowdhury received 4,37,646 votes (31.73%). This victory is historic as Chowdhury had held the seat for 25 years. Pathan's brother, Irfan Pathan, celebrated the win on social media, emphasizing Yusuf's commitment and integrity. In the broader election context, the INDIA alliance led by Congress is leading in 229 seats, while the BJP-led NDA is ahead in 296 seats, falling short of their 400-seat target. In West Bengal, TMC leads in 29 out of 42 seats.",

Following the results, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge held a press conference on Tuesday evening. Kharge stated that the election outcome reflects the will of the people and framed it as a battle between Modi and the public.

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha election results, the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) appears to be heading towards a majority, although the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is falling short of an outright majority. The INDIA Alliance is providing stiff competition. Current results suggest that under the leadership of PM Modi, the NDA is likely to secure a third consecutive victory, potentially making Modi the Prime Minister again. However, there are indications of a possible coalition government. With vote counting still ongoing in many constituencies, the final outcome remains uncertain. The results for all 542 Lok Sabha seats are expected to be clear by this evening.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nIn the context of the 2024 Lok Sabha election results, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi appeared optimistic, holding a copy of the Constitution and emphasizing the mandate to protect it. At that time, the INDIA alliance was leading in 235 seats, while the BJP-led NDA was ahead in 290 seats, surpassing the majority mark of 272. However, the BJP's reduced tally of 240 seats, compared to 303 in 2019, sparked hope in the Congress camp that Rahul Gandhi could potentially form the next government.\n\nWhen asked whether he would prefer to work from the opposition or attempt to form a government, Rahul deferred to Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge, who suggested consulting allies before making a decision. Rahul's response highlighted the complexities of coalition politics.\n\nTo form a government, the INDIA alliance would need to secure additional support, potentially from NDA partners like the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) with 16 MPs and Janata Dal United (JDU) with 12 MPs, as well as independents. This could bring their total to 270, just shy of the majority. Further support might come from AIMIM and other smaller parties, potentially reaching 274 seats. However, this remains challenging due to the political stances of key figures like Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nIn the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the opposition's INDIA Alliance has performed better than expected, while the ruling NDA, led by the BJP, has underperformed compared to its pre-election claims. Key leaders from the INDIA Alliance, including Rahul Gandhi, Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Mamata Banerjee, and Akhilesh Yadav, have seen their influence grow due to the election results.\n\n- **NDA Performance:** The NDA, which claimed it would win over 400 seats, is struggling to reach 300 seats. The BJP is leading in 241 seats, a significant drop from the 303 seats it won in 2019.\n- **INDIA Alliance Performance:** Contrary to predictions that it would not win 200 seats, the INDIA Alliance is leading in 231 seats. The Congress, part of this alliance, is leading in 99 seats, a substantial increase from its 52 seats in 2019.\n- **Key Leaders:**\n  - **Rahul Gandhi:** His efforts to revive the Congress are paying off, with the party nearing 100 seats. He is leading in both Wayanad (Kerala) and Rae Bareli (Uttar Pradesh).\n  - **Mamata Banerjee:** The TMC is leading in 29 out of 42 seats in West Bengal, an improvement from 22 seats in 2019, while the BJP's seats have decreased.\n  - **Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray:** In Maharashtra, the INDIA Alliance is performing well, with the Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (Sharad Pawar) showing strong results despite internal splits.\n  - **Akhilesh Yadav:** The Samajwadi Party is leading in 35 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, a significant gain from its 5 seats in 2019, while the BJP is facing a major loss in the state.\n\nThese results indicate a shift in the political landscape, with the INDIA Alliance gaining ground and key opposition leaders strengthening their positions.",

She mentioned that despite significant efforts and expenditures, Modi and Amit Shah's arrogance led to their defeat, even in Ayodhya. Banerjee expressed satisfaction that Modi did not achieve a majority and criticized his loss of credibility. She also noted that Modi would now need to seek support from TDP and Nitish Kumar and would be unable to pass laws at will. Additionally, Banerjee criticized Rahul Gandhi, stating that he did not respond to her congratulatory message and reiterated her previous advice to him regarding seat allocation.",

The BJP is currently leading in 14 out of the 25 seats in the state, while the Congress is ahead in 8 seats. Other parties like the CPI(M), RLP, and BAP are leading in one seat each. Key BJP candidates leading include Mahima Kumari Mewar in Rajsamand, Om Birla in Kota, Arjun Meghwal in Bikaner, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in Jodhpur, and Bhupendra Yadav in Alwar. Congress candidates leading include Murari Meena in Dausa. The results indicate a significant competition between the NDA and the INDIA alliance, with frequent shifts in lead positions.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, TMC candidate and former cricketer Yusuf Pathan defeated senior Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury in the Berhampore constituency of West Bengal. Chowdhury, who had been a four-time MP from this seat since 1999, lost by a margin of 59,351 votes. Pathan secured 408,240 votes, while Chowdhury received 348,889 votes. The BJP candidate came in third with approximately 312,876 votes. This defeat is a significant setback for Congress, as Chowdhury had been a prominent figure in the region. The election in West Bengal saw a triangular contest among TMC, BJP, and the Congress-Left alliance, with sporadic incidents of violence affecting the voting process. Despite being part of the opposition INDIA bloc at the national level, TMC and Congress contested against each other in the state.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Uttar Pradesh Lok Sabha elections, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) failed to maintain its 2014 record, with the party heading towards zero seats in Parliament. The BSP's vote share dropped to 9.36%, a significant decline from 19.77% in 2014. In contrast, the INDIA alliance, comprising the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress, performed well, while the BJP's performance deteriorated, securing 41.40% of the votes compared to 49.98% in 2019.\n\nPolitical analysts attribute BSP's poor performance to several mistakes by its leader, Mayawati. These include a lack of strong stance on constitutional and reservation issues, poor candidate selection, and internal party issues such as the removal of Akash Anand from responsibilities mid-election, which confused the youth. The BSP's vote base seemingly shifted towards the INDIA alliance, which was more vocal on key issues.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-led NDA secured 295 seats, ensuring a third term for Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, though he will need support from allies like Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu. The BJP faced significant losses, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, winning only 35 out of 80 seats, while the INDIA alliance led in 37 seats.\n\nA major upset occurred in Amethi, where Congress candidate Kishori Lal Sharma defeated BJP's Smriti Irani by a margin of 1.30 lakh votes. Sharma, a trusted aide of the Gandhi family and a political strategist, dedicated his victory to the Congress party. He has a long history with the Gandhi family, starting his political career in 1983 with Rajiv Gandhi and later becoming a close associate of Sonia Gandhi.\n\nSmriti Irani's defeat is attributed to her overconfidence, failure to connect with voters, and underestimating Sharma. In contrast, Sharma maintained strong grassroots connections and worked diligently in Amethi, which contributed to his victory. This win also avenged Rahul Gandhi's previous loss to Irani in 2019.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha election results, Maneka Gandhi, a nine-time MP, is trailing significantly in the Sultanpur constituency. The early trends indicate that the NDA, led by PM Narendra Modi, is likely to form the government but will fall short of a majority by 30 seats, necessitating reliance on coalition partners. The BJP has lost several seats in Uttar Pradesh due to the INDIA alliance's influence, with prominent leaders like Smriti Irani and Maneka Gandhi lagging behind. In Sultanpur, SP candidate Rambhual Nishad is leading by over 26,000 votes. The voter turnout in Sultanpur was 55.61%, slightly lower than in 2019. The SP's strategic nomination of Nishad and the BSP's focus on Kurmi votes have made the contest particularly competitive. Historically, no single leader has dominated the Sultanpur seat, with varied winners from Congress, BJP, and BSP over the years.",

        "summary": "In the ongoing vote count for the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections, surprising results are emerging, particularly for prominent leaders. One notable case is Maulana Badruddin Ajmal of the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) from the Dhubri Lok Sabha seat in Assam, which has a 55% Muslim voter base. Ajmal, who has been a three-time MP from Dhubri, is trailing by approximately 700,000 votes to Congress candidate Raqibul Hussain, indicating a likely defeat.\n\nAjmal, a well-known figure among Bengali-speaking migrant Muslims in Dhubri, founded AIUDF in 2005 and has seen a decline in vote share over the past three elections. The Congress party's strategy to portray AIUDF as the \"B Team\" of BJP and Ajmal as an old lion has seemingly resonated with voters, contributing to his potential loss. This election is seen as a critical battle for Ajmal's political survival.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nIn the 2024 Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections, N. Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has secured a significant victory, ensuring Naidu's return as Chief Minister on June 9. The ruling YSR Congress has only managed to lead in 24 seats. TDP, part of the NDA alliance, contested 144 seats, while Jana Sena Party (JSP) and BJP contested 21 and 10 seats respectively. Following the victory, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah congratulated Naidu. Despite rumors, there have been no discussions between Naidu and the INDIA alliance leaders. In the Lok Sabha elections, the NDA is also performing well, with TDP leading in 16 out of 25 seats and the NDA overall leading in 21 seats. This success may be crucial for BJP in forming the central government.",

        "summary": "The results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections have started coming in, with several Bhojpuri superstars contesting. BJP candidates Manoj Tiwari, Ravi Kishan, and Dinesh Lal Yadav 'Nirahua' are in the fray, while Pawan Singh is running as an independent from Karakat. Pawan Singh is trailing by 72,425 votes, while Manoj Tiwari leads by 105,921 votes in North East Delhi, and Ravi Kishan leads by 83,824 votes in Gorakhpur. However, Dinesh Lal Yadav 'Nirahua' is trailing by 122,634 votes in Azamgarh.\n\nPawan Singh initially contested from Asansol, West Bengal, but withdrew due to controversy over his songs. He later ran as an independent from Karakat, drawing large crowds but not translating this into votes.\n\nManoj Tiwari is poised to become a three-time MP, facing Congress candidate Kanhaiya Kumar. In 2019, Tiwari won North East Delhi with 53.86% of the vote.\n\nRavi Kishan, the BJP candidate from Gorakhpur, is competing against SP's Kajal Nishad and BSP's Javed Simnani. In 2019, Kishan received 717,122 votes.\n\nDinesh Lal Yadav 'Nirahua' is contesting against SP's Dharmendra Yadav in Azamgarh. In 2019, SP's Akhilesh Yadav won the seat but later vacated it, leading to Nirahua's by-election win in 2022.\n\nThe election results indicate mixed outcomes for these Bhojpuri stars, with some leading and others trailing significantly.",

        "summary": "The 2024 Lok Sabha election results indicate a return to coalition government in India after a decade. The BJP has emerged as the largest party for the third consecutive time but has fallen short of the 272-seat majority needed to form a government independently. The BJP will need to rely on its NDA allies to form a government. The opposition INDIA alliance has improved its performance but remains far from a majority. The Congress and Samajwadi Party (SP) have made significant gains, with Congress nearing 100 seats and SP securing 33 seats in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP has been reduced to 36 seats in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP's ability to form a government now heavily depends on regional allies like TDP's Chandrababu Naidu and JDU's Nitish Kumar, who are projected to win 16 and 14 seats respectively. The political landscape suggests potential negotiations and power struggles ahead.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha election results for Uttar Pradesh, the focus is on the state's 80 seats. Current trends show the BJP leading in 37 seats, while the INDIA alliance is ahead in 42 seats. Samajwadi Party MP Javed Ali Khan discussed the trends and Akhilesh Yadav's efforts with Himanshu Shekhar Mishra. Khan emphasized that the Samajwadi Party has always supported uniting representatives from backward classes, Dalits, and minority communities to create a new political alternative. This election, Akhilesh Yadav prioritized social engineering by giving significant attention to various caste and social groups in ticket distribution.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha election results, no single party has achieved a clear majority. The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is projected to win 296 seats, while the INDIA alliance is expected to secure 230 seats. In Uttar Pradesh, the partnership between Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav has been successful. This raises the question of whether the INDIA alliance can form the central government. On social media, similar questions are being discussed. With 230 seats, the INDIA alliance falls 72 seats short of the majority mark.\n\nDespite being far from the majority, the INDIA alliance is likely to gain support from the Trinamool Congress if it attempts to form a government. Nitish Kumar, who initiated the INDIA alliance and hosted its first meeting in Patna, is a key figure in this context. The BJP had formed a government with the Janata Dal (United) in January 2024.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha election results, the NDA alliance has secured a majority, but the opposition INDIA alliance has given a tough competition. The BJP failed to achieve a clear majority, unlike in 2019. The opposition successfully capitalized on the anti-incumbency sentiment against the Modi government. Here are the five main reasons for BJP's setback:\n\n1. **Effective Opposition Campaign**: The opposition's narrative on issues like reservation and constitutional changes resonated with voters, while BJP's campaign failed to connect.\n2. **Impact of Regional Parties**: Regional parties like Akhilesh Yadav's SP in Uttar Pradesh, TMC in West Bengal, and DMK in Tamil Nadu performed well, significantly affecting BJP's results, especially in Uttar Pradesh.\n3. **Muslim Voter Support**: The Muslim community largely voted for the INDIA alliance, as indicated by exit polls.\n4. **Youth Voter Preference**: Young voters (ages 18-35) preferred the INDIA alliance, seeking change, while BJP's voter base was older.\n5. **Trust in Congress Manifesto**: Congress's promises, such as the 'Nyay' scheme and job guarantees for youth, gained public trust and proved effective.\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to the BJP's inability to secure a clear majority in the 2024 elections.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nIn the wake of the Lok Sabha election results, attention is focused on Nitish Kumar, the leader of the Janata Dal (United) (JDU) in Bihar. The JDU has shown a strong performance, leading in 15 out of 16 seats it contested. This has led to significant political maneuvering, with BJP state president Samrat Choudhary meeting Nitish Kumar, and the INDIA alliance attempting to bring him into their fold. Sharad Pawar has also reportedly spoken with Nitish Kumar, although Pawar denies any recent conversations with Kumar or Chandrababu Naidu. The BJP, which appears to be falling short of a majority with 242 seats, is looking for allies, making Nitish Kumar a key figure in the formation of the next government. The political landscape remains uncertain as all parties await Nitish Kumar's next move.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nIn the wake of the 2024 Lok Sabha election results, significant turbulence was observed in the stock market, with the Sensex dropping over 4000 points and Nifty around 1300 points. AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh attributed this market crash to misleading exit polls, which had predicted a strong victory for the BJP-led NDA with around 400 seats. However, the actual trends showed NDA leading with over 290 seats and the INDIA alliance with over 230 seats, contrary to the exit polls. Singh criticized the exit polls for causing financial losses to millions and confusing the public and institutions. He called for an apology from the TV channels and survey agencies responsible for the exit polls. Singh also expressed concerns about potential discrepancies during the final vote count and urged vigilance from INDIA alliance members.",

        "summary": "In the ongoing vote count for the 2024 UP Lok Sabha elections, a tight contest is observed between the INDIA and NDA alliances. The Samajwadi Party (SP) is leading on 37 seats, while the Congress is ahead on 7 seats, and the BJP is leading on 33 seats. Notably, in Sultanpur, BJP's Maneka Gandhi is trailing significantly behind SP's Ram Bhual Nishad, who is ahead by 26,008 votes. The Bahujan Samaj Party's Udaraj Verma is also far behind with 150,340 votes.\n\nKey points include:\n- SP's Akhilesh Yadav is leading in Kannauj by around 80,000 votes.\n- Congress candidate Kishori Lal Sharma is leading in Amethi by about 62,000 votes.\n- Prime Minister Narendra Modi is leading in Varanasi by 121,161 votes against Congress's Ajay Rai.\n\nThese trends indicate a competitive election with significant implications for the political landscape in Uttar Pradesh.",

        "summary": "In the ongoing vote count for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA is leading with around 300 seats, while the INDIA alliance is ahead in approximately 230 seats. This is surprising for the BJP, which had high expectations from Uttar Pradesh (UP), hoping to win 72-75 out of 80 seats. However, current trends show the BJP trailing behind the INDIA alliance in UP, with the BJP leading in 37 seats and the INDIA alliance in 42.\n\nThe BJP had previously dominated UP in the 2014 and 2019 elections, winning 71 and 62 seats respectively. Despite the inauguration of the Ram Temple and the perceived strong support for Hindutva, the BJP's strategy failed against the opposition's social coalition and strategic planning. The INDIA alliance, particularly the partnership between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress, has proven effective, focusing on positive issues and gaining public trust.\n\nThe BJP fielded candidates in 75 out of 80 seats in UP, with allies contesting the remaining seats. The INDIA alliance, comprising SP and Congress, contested together, with Congress fielding candidates in 17 seats and SP in the rest. The BJP's overconfidence and failure to gauge ground realities have led to its unexpected setback in its stronghold of UP.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections for the Rohtak constituency in Haryana, Congress candidate Deepender Singh Hooda is leading by 189,357 votes against BJP candidate Dr. Arvind Sharma. As of 1:30 PM, Hooda has received 388,741 votes, while Sharma has 199,384 votes. Deepender Singh Hooda, son of former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, has previously served as MP for this seat three times but lost in the 2019 elections to Sharma by a narrow margin. The Rohtak seat, historically significant and a stronghold for the Congress party, has seen victories for the party since 1991, except in 1999 and 2019. The constituency spans three districts and includes nine assembly seats, with a significant Jat voter base. The outcome of this election could impact the political landscape, especially considering the historical dominance of the Congress in this region.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nIn the ongoing vote counting for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-led NDA coalition is nearing 300 seats, while the Congress-led INDIA alliance is projected to win around 225 seats. Senior Congress leader Pawan Khera raised concerns on social media about the delay in election results and questioned the Election Commission's transparency. He expressed confidence that the INDIA alliance would secure 295 seats if the process is fair. Congress leader Rajeev Shukla commented that the trends indicate a rejection of the BJP by the public, suggesting that the BJP might struggle to form a majority government. Meanwhile, JDU leader KC Tyagi reaffirmed their support for the NDA under Nitish Kumar's leadership, despite recent meetings with Prime Minister Modi.",

        "summary": "The ongoing vote count for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections shows the NDA alliance leading with 296 seats, while the 'INDIA' alliance is ahead in 230 seats. Despite the BJP's goal of surpassing 400 seats, trends indicate this dream will not materialize, and the BJP has not yet secured a majority on its own. Historically, only the Congress party, under Rajiv Gandhi's leadership, has crossed the 400-seat mark, winning 404 seats in the 1984 elections following Indira Gandhi's assassination. The 2024 elections were conducted in seven phases, with the final phase ending on June 1, and vote counting began on June 4. The Election Commission has made results available on its website and app. Exit polls had predicted that the NDA would perform better than its 2019 record of 352 seats.",

        "summary": "In the Wayanad Lok Sabha election results, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is leading significantly. He is competing against BJP's state president K. Surendran and CPI's senior leader Annie Raja. Despite Congress and CPI being part of the INDIA alliance nationally, they are contesting against each other in Kerala. Rahul Gandhi is also contesting from Uttar Pradesh's Raebareli seat.\n\nAs per the current vote count, Rahul Gandhi has received over 550,000 votes, Annie Raja has over 246,000 votes, and K. Surendran has more than 128,000 votes. In the 2019 elections, Rahul Gandhi won the Wayanad seat with over 700,000 votes, while CPI's P.P. Suneer was second with around 275,000 votes.\n\nThe Wayanad seat was created after the 2008 delimitation, and Congress has consistently won since then. The constituency includes seven assembly seats spread across Wayanad, Malappuram, and Kozhikode districts. The population is predominantly Muslim (46%), with significant Christian (11%), tribal (9%), and SC (6%) communities.\n\nKey issues in Wayanad include the implementation of the CAA, healthcare deficiencies, delays in railway line construction between Nilambur and Nanjangud, and highway construction between Mananthavady and Bavali. Despite the national alliance, CPI's Annie Raja is contesting against Congress in Kerala, highlighting internal conflicts within the INDIA alliance. Political analysts note that Congress General Secretary K.C. Venugopal, a native of Kannur, played a key role in bringing Rahul Gandhi to Wayanad.",

In response, the Congress-led INDIA alliance has initiated efforts to prevent the BJP from coming to power. Key figures involved in these efforts include Sharad Pawar, who has reached out to Bihar's Chief Minister and JDU leader Nitish Kumar, and Stalin, who is in contact with Chandrababu Naidu. The situation indicates a strategic maneuvering to form alliances and gain the necessary support.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Maharashtra Lok Sabha elections, Uddhav Thackeray has emerged as the true leader of the Shiv Sena, causing significant losses for the BJP and its alliance. The BJP's seat count has decreased nationwide, with major losses in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. In Maharashtra, the NDA won 41 seats in 2019, but this time, the BJP is projected to win only 12 seats, down from 23. Uddhav Thackeray's faction, Shiv Sena (UBT), has gained strength, contributing to the INDIA alliance's success, which is expected to secure 28 seats, up from the previous UPA's 5 seats. The Congress is also set to increase its seats from 4 to 10. The election results indicate a significant shift in voter support towards the INDIA alliance in Maharashtra.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the ongoing results of the Lok Sabha elections, highlighting the challenges faced by the BJP in securing a majority. As the results for the 542 seats become clearer, the BJP appears to be struggling to form a government on its own, with its seat share significantly reduced compared to previous elections. The NDA is leading in 296 seats, while the INDIA alliance is ahead in 234 seats. The BJP alone is projected to win 242 seats, falling short of the 272 needed for a majority.\n\nThe article also references Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's prediction that there would be a power shift in Uttar Pradesh, which seems to be coming true as the BJP loses significant ground in key states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, and West Bengal. In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP's seats have halved from 62 in 2019 to 31. Similar declines are seen in West Bengal and Bihar.\n\nIn Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, NDA's coalition partners are performing better than the BJP. In Bihar, Nitish Kumar's JD(U) and other allies are leading in more seats than the BJP. In Andhra Pradesh, the TDP is leading in 16 out of 25 seats, while the BJP is ahead in only 3.\n\nThe article underscores the significant losses for the BJP and the potential implications for its ability to form a government independently.",

        "summary": "In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the counting of votes is ongoing for 542 seats. The BJP-led NDA has secured over 280 seats, achieving a majority, but it remains unclear if the BJP alone can form a majority government. The opposition INDIA alliance has crossed 220 seats. Notably, the BJP has lost significant ground in Uttar Pradesh compared to previous elections. The Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress have disrupted BJP's dominance on several key seats in UP. \n\nKey highlights include:\n- SP is leading on 35 seats, and Congress on 7 seats in UP.\n- Congress candidate Kishori Lal Sharma is leading in Amethi, pushing BJP's Smriti Irani behind.\n- Rahul Gandhi is leading in Rae Bareli.\n- SP candidates are ahead in Muzaffarnagar, Azamgarh, Mirzapur, Ayodhya, Sultanpur, Meerut, and Firozabad.\n- Congress candidates are leading in Saharanpur, Amroha, Sitapur, Rae Bareli, Amethi, Allahabad, and Barabanki.\n\nThese results indicate a significant shift in voter sentiment in UP, impacting BJP's overall performance.",

        "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nThe 2024 Lok Sabha election results indicate significant challenges for the BJP despite the NDA's potential to form the government. The opposition's INDIA alliance is giving a tough fight, particularly in key states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, leading to substantial losses for the BJP, which is falling short of a majority on its own. The BJP is projected to win around 250 seats, a loss of approximately 60 seats from the previous election. Key allies like Nitish Kumar's JDU and the TDP are crucial, with Kumar potentially becoming a kingmaker. The BJP's bargaining power is reduced compared to 2014 and 2019, and it may need to compromise on major ministerial positions. Additionally, the BJP's agenda items like the Uniform Civil Code and population control laws may face hurdles due to the need for coalition support.",

        "summary": "In Lucknow, during the ongoing vote counting for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections at the Ramabai Ambedkar ground, a clash erupted between supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP). The altercation led to a SP worker sustaining a head injury. The conflict reportedly began with a verbal dispute that escalated into physical violence.\n\nThe vote counting in Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 Lok Sabha seats, started at 8 AM across 81 centers in 75 districts. Initial counting began with postal ballots, followed by Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). Exit polls have suggested a favorable outcome for the ruling BJP, prompting opposition parties like SP and Congress to prepare rigorously for the counting process. SP leader Akhilesh Yadav accused the government of deliberately slowing down the counting process due to BJP's declining seat count. As of now, the \"INDIA\" alliance is leading in 43 seats, while the NDA is ahead in 36 seats.",

        "summary": "The Election Commission of India (ECI) is conducting the counting of votes for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is on track to secure a majority, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leading in several key areas. In Uttar Pradesh, there is a close contest between BJP (33 seats) and Samajwadi Party (36 seats). Current tallies show BJP with 238 seats, Indian National Congress (INC) with 97, and Samajwadi Party with 34. High-profile candidates include Narendra Modi leading in Varanasi, Rahul Gandhi leading in Wayanad and Rae Bareli, and other notable figures like Ashok Gehlot's son and Lalu Yadav's daughter contesting in Rajasthan and Bihar, respectively. The final results are expected by the evening of June 4, 2024. Exit polls predict a significant victory for the NDA, with estimates ranging from 370 to 401 seats. The counting process includes postal ballots first, followed by EVM votes, and VVPAT verification, which may delay the final results. The ECI will update results on their website and mobile apps.",

        "summary": "In a recent analysis, it was highlighted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of a \"Congress-free India\" remains unfulfilled. Despite Modi's significant victories in the 2014 and 2019 elections, where the BJP secured 282 and 303 seats respectively, the Congress party has shown resilience. In 2014, Congress was reduced to 44 seats, losing its status as the main opposition party. However, by 2019, it had increased its tally to 52 seats.\n\nAs the 2024 general elections approach, exit polls suggest that Congress might surpass 100 seats, indicating a resurgence. Modi's campaign has continued to target Congress with accusations of dynastic politics and minority appeasement, but these attacks have not significantly diminished Congress's appeal to voters.\n\nRecent exit polls predicted a strong performance for the BJP-led NDA, estimating 365 seats, but actual results indicate that the BJP may not achieve a majority on its own, falling short of the 272-seat mark. This development underscores the challenges Modi faces in realizing his goal of a Congress-free India.",
