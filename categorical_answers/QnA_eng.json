        "body": "According to the , the counting of votes will commence at 8 AM, on Tuesday, June 4. This will cover not only the Lok Sabha elections but also the state legislative assemblies of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, along with various bye-elections.\n\nFor the latest updates on the Lok Sabha election results, you can visit the official Election Commission of India (ECI) website: https://results.eci.gov.in/. These updates will also be accessible via the Voter Helpline App, compatible with both iOS and Android devices.\n\nTo experience comprehensive coverage, constituency wise updates and debates, the election results will be live-streamed on various news channels, YouTube channels, and social media accounts of major news outlets. Enthusiasts of large screen experience in Maharashtra, including Mumbai, can watch the 2024 Lok Sabha election results live in theatres as well as MovieMax will showcase the event titled 'Election Results 2024' starting at 9 AM.\n\nUnder Rule 54 A of the Conduct of Elections Rules 1961, the process for counting votes starts with postal ballots at the Returning Officer's (RO) table. Thirty minutes into postal ballot counting, Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) votes can be counted, or immediately if no postal ballots are present.\n\nCounting officials must ensure that the EVM's Control Unit (CU) seal is intact and that the total votes match Form 17C before counting. Results from the CU are recorded in Part-II of Form 17C, verified by the counting supervisor, micro observer, and candidate agents. If the CU's display fails, VVPAT slips are counted post CU counting.\n\nResults for each CU are documented and signed in Form 17C, which is then sent for compiling the final result in Form 20. VVPAT slip counting starts after CU votes are counted, with mandatory verification of VVPAT slips from five random polling stations per constituency. If the victory margin is less than the rejected postal ballots, those ballots are re-verified before declaring the result. In case of a tie, the winner is determined by a draw of lots.",

        "body": "Phew! Tomorrow as ballot boxes are counted we shall know who will sit on India's Raj gaddi in this hard-fought theeka-dhuandhar elections. Encapsulated brilliantly in an adage: Poll is a right whore. She often gives but also takes away all in one fell swoop. Even as all exit polls predict BJP Modi's clean sweep, INDIA bloc's Congress tom-tom their victory. Either which way in politics it's not over till it's over and jo jeeta wohi sikander!\n\nUndeniably, Election 2024 is easily the most polarising one in recent electoral history. Forget mutual antipathy and mistrust, it is an election which spewed hatred between communities on religious basis to polarise people built on those supporting Modi or his INDIA bloc opponents with barely any meeting ground between the two which was violated on a scale never seen before.\n\nAlso, unlike 2014 or 2019, 2024 was most Presidential, selling Brand Modi whereby the Party and its candidates were secondary to the Gaurantee called Modi. Of course, the Prime Minister led a grueling campaign seeking a third term with no challenger. While, the Opposition which appeared divided, jaded and listless at first managed to get its act together and mounted an aggressive counter against BJP. But, was hamstrung when it came to countering the NaMo cult.\n\nThis election stands testimony to Congress decline when it fielded the lowest number of candidates ever totaling 294 of 543 Lok Sabha seats. Surprising, as bhai-behen Rahul-Priyanka duo did show signs of reviving its deflated cadres, but desperate to stop Modi from returning to power continues to be confused about its support base and fell back on its tried and tested formula -- abuse and corruption as poll plank.\n\nCampaigning for a greater part appealed to bad-mouthing opponents preaching fire and brimstone sermons. Worse, the political discourse has never been more neech, gross, coarse, divisive, inflammatory and pungent sans any debate on vital issues debilitating the nation. Be it citizenry's needs and wants, unemployment, healthcare, farmers distress and rising food inflation. Making plain our democratic process is severely under strain with none caring a damn for the Election Commission's (EC) Model Code of Conduct.\n\nWith polls being all about rah-rahs and unsavoury put-downs, which sadly, voters seem to have accepted as par for the course. Notwithstanding, EC trying, though half-heartedly, to rein in 'star campaigners' across the political spectrum. Alongside our leaders' obsession with the numbers game: seats won, vote shares, voter turnout, number of rallies and size etc. Yet, beyond quantity, the quality left a lot wanting.\n\nCertainly, Opposition left no stone unturned to raise questions on flaws in electoral rolls, efficacy of EVMs, alleged fudging of voter turnout figures and attempts to influence 150 District Magistrates and collectors yet no substantive evidence was put forth. Besides, there were no complaints from candidates and those receiving Form 17 C which records votes polled in a booth, said Election Commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar yesterday.\n\nClearing the air on various allegations against the Commission, CEC asserted, \"the one making allegations was present in the kachahari but there was no gavah. He also commented on memes on social media describing the EC as 'Laapata gentlemen' for being absent amid MCC violations by top leaders during electioneering, clarifying that he and two fellow Commissioners were \"never out and always here. We issued 100 press notes and advisories.\"\n\nPatting itself, CEC averred only 39 re-polls were held as opposed to 540 in 2019 while 27 States didn't require re-polling. For resons best known to him, he discounted poll violence, obviously turning a blind eye to major incidents in West Bengal.\n\nHowever, the EC was found wanting in taking action to ensure parties respected the MCC. Resulting in a perception, the three wise men allowed MCC to be violated and were too lenient about transgressions of BJP and its leaders, especially in censuring leaders indulging in hate speech. Besides, the delay in releasing voter turnout has cast a cloud on its reputation.\n\nOpposition leaders call the EC a paper tiger and for being extremely partisan leading to its functioning and impartiality being profoundly degraded. Recently, it banned AAP's official campaign song on the pretext it showed \"BJP and its agencies in poor light\". If this was a criteria does it not amount to a muzzling of criticism and accountability, the life-breath of democracy?\n\nOn the other hand, it turned a blind eye when BJP ran explicit dog-whistling campaigns targeting Muslims or when it spread canards about the Congress manifesto. Also, when Modi created a false impression that people's money and women's mangalsutras would be taken away in the name of wealth redistribution and given to \"infiltrators\" and \"those who have more children\", EC sent a notice not to Modi but BJP Chief Nadda. Clearly, the institution has a problem in hand.\n\nBesides, even as institutions may be under strain in the backdrop of all-round decline in conversation but competitive electoral democracy at the grassroots level is alive and kicking. And no leader, however popular, can take the voter for granted. Every vote has to be fought for with hard work, by hard selling promises and achievements and unfortunately, not by stoking fears about what might be.\n\nThe good thing is the electorate knew its choices and seemed unwilling to be impressed by legacy, placing a premium on record. The bad thing: Being enamoured by freebies and all too susceptible to polarizing rhetoric.\n\nAt the same time even as elections are all about competition and campaigns do leaders need to stoop so low as to manufacture fears, and then personally malign opponents to win votes? Modi's speeches were filled with anti-Muslim verbose while Opposition created a scare over possible amendments to the Constitution to take away benefits of reservation.\n\nUndeniably, these dog whisles vitiated the atmosphere and lowered the dignity of discourse. A nation which prides itself in being the mother of democracy needs to do better when it comes to language of electioneering.\n\nIn the ultimate, as one does a cost-benefit analysis time for our polity to realize they can disagree without being disagreeable, be critical yet engaging and constructive. Voters too need to demand more of our netagan and go beyond sharing images of inked fingers proof of 'job done.'\n\nPerhaps the time has come for Parties to get a complete makeover, good politicians and a new set of rules which fight for policies and problems that bother their electorate and uphold the ideals of democracy. The dignity of the electoral process which draws a lakshman rekha on vulgarity and vows not to cross it. Along-with overhauling the election apparatus.\n\nOnce the heat and dust of this gigantic exercise involving over one crore polling personnel, the unsung heroes, to elect 543 Lok Sabha MPs dissipates and settles down, both the supply and demand side of governance will mature in quality, and not just in quantity.\n\nTrue, it might be wishful thinking to even think that this narrative will return to normal and business as usual once polls are over. Primarily as they could leave our polity and society divided and scarred. Whereby a lot of time, effort and statesmanship will be required to undo the damage.\n\nTime our leaders understand that Prime Ministers will come and go but their words will stay. Which will influence young minds and teach them to show dignity and respect for others. The lead will have to be taken by none other than the next Prime Minister. -- -- INFA",

        "body": "The outcome of the long-drawn-out polling for Mandate 2024 will be out on Tuesday. This was arguably one of the most polarising general election campaigns the country has witnessed. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi led a grueling campaign, seeking a third term in office for the BJP. On the other hand, the opposition which appeared divided, jaded, and listless at the beginning of the elections managed to get its act together and mounted an aggressive counter against the ruling party. It witnessed fierce debate. The campaign was deeply communal with minority Muslim bashing becoming the norm during the campaign.\n\nThe campaign revealed one thing about India. Institutions may be under strain in India, but competitive electoral democracy is alive and kicking at the grassroots, and no leader, however popular one may think the person is, can take the voters for granted. Every vote has to be fought for with hard work, by hard-selling promises and achievements and, unfortunately, by stoking fears about what might be. The good thing is that the electorate is particular about its choices and seems unwilling to be impressed by legacy, placing a premium on record. The bad thing is they are often enamoured by freebies, and all too susceptible to polarising rhetoric. The result will be out and soon a new government will be formed. But the deeply polarising campaign has once again hurt the social fabric of the nation. One wonders how long can this be allowed to be continued. Someone needs to put an end to communal politics and focus on development.",

India has proved that it has the electoral democracy in its DNA that gives expression to the public opinion to govern the nation. The public participation to choose the new Lok Sabha and the new national government is testimony to the maturity of the Indian nation when conflict has become the hallmark in the modern democracies of the world. India has stood the test of the time when it comes to upholding the parliamentary democracy.2024 Lok Sabha Election has proved without any doubt that there may be difference of political ideologies among the political parties both at the regional and the national level. But when it comes to national governance then the most difficult political disagreements are insignificant and national interest takes the centre stage. This year the percentage of voting has crossed the previous records in the conflict zones and people have come out in large numbers to cast their vote. People in Jammu and Kashmir have proved many political pundits wrong. The poll percentage has crossed the previous records. Kashmir valley has underlined the power of the ballot and rejected the regression of the bullet. The \"Naya Kashmir \" has invested its vote for the comprehensive development and peace in the valley. This election in the aftermath of the neutralisation of Article 370 and 35A signifies the change of mood. And the mood is for sending representatives to the parliament who can express the people's aspirations and get them operationalized through policies. If the writing on the wall is read carefully then it can be said with utmost confidence and conviction that the people in Jammu and Kashmir want the Assembly Elections to be conducted in consonance with the Supreme Court Direction by September. This mood must not be squandered. Aspirations of the people must get redressal to be stakeholders in the national resurgence. The cause for confidence of the voters all over India has another reason and that is the strong centre. In the last two decades India has witnessed a stable government. This has led to development of faith in the people that their votes are valuable weapons to shape the destiny of the nation. The improvement in the internal security, upgradation of the national security, economic boom, strong foreign policy and above all a leadership guided by conviction that governs on the principle of the nation first. It would not be an exaggeration that the Modi factor has led the voters to cast their votes. Prime Minister has been able to reach the voters through his policies at the grass root level with a segmented approach. This has paid dividends and made voters reinforce their faith in the national festival of the Lok Sabha Election with rejuvenation. No one will be surprised to see the seat tally tomorrow. The Lok Sabha Election 2024 is a referendum for the \"Nation First\" and everyone knows what that means. Opposition has been lac lustre as far as its election manifestos are concerned. And what has added to the crisis in the INDI Alliance camp is the absence of the mutually accepted national leader who can deliver and appeal to the masses. The reason being that Narendra Modi has set high standards when it comes to leadership. So the Lok Sabha Verdict 2024 is a foregone conclusion that the Indian Nation will repeat the strong leadership that has delivered on national issues.",

        "body": "As India awaits the results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, discussions focus on the fairness of the process and the potential implications of different outcomes for the nation's democracy. (PTI Image)\n\nA painfully long general election in our hottest summer has finally ended. The tea leaves will be read in the exit polls that were released on Saturday evening, but one must keep in mind their imperfect record. Even for a single state, West Bengal, which held Assembly elections in the summer of 2021, one out of four got the result wrong. Opinion polls, conducted before this longest cycle of elections was announced, were unanimous that the BJP would get a majority.\n\nToday, some are not sure this will be the case, but we shall see. Without knowing the results, however, what can be said about the election that is still important? Let us work our way through the possibilities.\n\nThe first is that no matter who wins, this was not a free or fair election. Two chief ministers were jailed before the campaigning began. Jailed not because they were convicted but because the BJP wanted them jailed. One of them was released for a few days of campaigning, but will have to return to jail now.\n\nThe access to bank accounts of the Opposition was restricted, through attacks made by the Central investigative agencies controlled by the BJP. The Election Commission compromised itself, sadly, and allowed the BJP to control both the planning of the phases and their execution. The commission's insolent replies to the Opposition, its refusal to act on the Prime Minister's hate speeches against Muslims and its refusal to release the poll data on time has harmed our democracy. The electoral bonds scheme was determined to be unconstitutional, but thousands of crores raised under it were used in this election, and this has tainted it, quite irredeemably in my opinion.\n\nNext, let's look at what the possibilities are. Since the opinion polls were unanimous, the most likely one may seem to be that Narendra Modi returns to office with a similarly large majority. What should one expect in that case? More of the same, of course. He has run the nation as one would a monarchy and his ministers are courtiers (see their social media accounts bleating his glories). The Opposition parties will continue to be attacked through the misuse of official agencies, civil society will be force-marched towards extinction and India's plummeting on the global indices will continue. The minorities, and especially Muslims, will continue to have open season declared on them. The institutions will continue on their path of decline. The consolidation of what a former chief economic adviser has referred to as \"the two As\" will continue, meaning a corporate capture of the economy. In short, what we see around us today will remain as it is.\n\nIt is unhealthy to have a single-party state, as has happened in Gujarat. The Opposition exists, but only on sufferance. What happened to opponents and prospective candidates in Surat and in Varanasi will repeat in more places.\n\nIt should be conceded that if he wins again, Narendra Modi will be the most successful leader we have seen in our history, and delivering three consecutive Lok Sabha wins after three Assembly wins all with absolute majorities will be a singular achievement.\n\nThe second possibility is that the BJP gets a plurality of seats but not an absolute majority. Say, they get 250 seats and form the government. In this case, the situation changes in several ways. First, the allies will begin to assert themselves and it will no longer be possible for the king to ignore the courtiers. Does Mr Modi have it in him to function in a more democratic manner? No. This will make such a government a whole lot more volatile.\n\nWithin the party, there will be people wanting to assert themselves. The old men in Nagpur, always playing the long game, will raise their heads and become more visible.\n\nSome of the things will shift, though the attack on minorities is likely to continue, because that happens at the level of the states, where in several places the BJP enjoys a certain popularity because of its bigotry. The attack on federalism will recede. Today, India is federal only in name. The states have no power to tax after GST and the unhappiness of many has broken out into the open. Law and order continues to be a state subject, but from Delhi to Jharkhand to Karnataka to Bengal, the Union government has sent out its agencies to undermine state governments and chief ministers. With the Union government as strong and unwilling to change as it has been, there has been no attempt at redressal. An alliance government will likely alter that and this will be good for our country.\n\nThe last possibility is, of course, that the BJP loses. On the evidence of the opinion polls, this is the least likely possibility but one that we have to consider. To my mind, this will be a good outcome and not because of personal preferences entirely. Democracy renews and refreshes itself with changes in government. One man presiding for decades -- take Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un -- rarely produces anything positive. Some of the things, many of them in fact, that we have taken on since 2014 need to be got rid of. It is true that our democracy gives us the option of countering them in other ways, for instance through the courts or through protests. But elections are the only way in which changes take place structurally.",

        "title": "Sunil Gatade | A bizarre controversy on the exit poll predictions",
        "body": "India awaits verdict: 2024 Lok Sabha election results to determine Modi's fate\n\nOn Tuesday, June 4, the nation will learn who will come to power after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections with the announcement of the much-awaited results that will decide the fate of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP, the world's largest party, as well as of the Opposition parties.\n\nBut before the actual counting, much drama and dispute has been seen over the exit poll predictions that have spoken of a landslide for the BJP under Mr Modi.\n\nIt has curiously run into a controversy with the Opposition seeking to dismiss the findings and insisting it was very much in the race to come to power. Such a counter-offensive by the opposition is an unprecedented move, turning the whole situation a little bizarre.\n\nShiv Sena's Sanjay Raut, himself a journalist, claimed the Opposition I.N.D.I.A. grouping is thick in the game and could win 295 of the total 543 seats, which has added much curiosity as to what is in store. His claim came a day after the meeting of I.N.D.I.A. leaders.\n\nNever in the past has any Opposition questioned the outcome of the exit polls in such a forceful manner, questioning the very intent of the polling companies and suggesting that there is more to it than meets the eye.\n\nThe nation had seen such a landslide in 1971 and 1984 in the wake of the Bangladesh war and the assassination of Indira Gandhi. In contrast, the 2024 election is a \"normal\" one.\n\nThe exit poll predictions show unequivocally that the BJP under Mr Modi is way ahead in the Lok Sabha race against the I.N.D.I.A. grouping, one of whose main constituents is the Congress.\n\nThe actual numbers will put a stamp of approval/disapproval on the business of exit polls, pre-poll surveys and such exercises in the world's largest democracy. The outcome is expected to reveal what has weighed on the minds of voters, what has gone wrong for the rival sides and what has helped them. It must be conceded that the just-concluded campaign was the toughest one for Prime Minister Modi, who has been on a winning spree since Gujarat days in 2002.\n\nThis election will go down in history as the most puzzling for Mr Modi, as the hero of many an electoral battle who was fighting in the dark this time. Many commentators had claimed that Mr Modi may have missed the bus this time as he had delayed the announcement of the polls, which according to them should have happened in January after the Ram Mandir's inauguration in Ayodhya.\n\nThe two-month-long election schedule too looked a bit troublesome with the BJP, which was intended for Mr Modi to have much time for campaigning but appeared too tiring for him for want of a narrative.\n\nIf the exit poll predictions prove true, the lesson for the Opposition is that they could be a fighting force in states where they have worked hard and joined hands in fierce combat, and that the same must be replicated at the national level.\n\nThe exit polls show that the Opposition is doing much better in states like Maharashtra and Bihar because there they not only worked hard but unitedly too.\n\nThe moral of the story is that Mr Modi is not invincible and could be contained or defeated if the Opposition works purposefully with a plan of action and has boots on the ground.\n\nThe Opposition leaders, such as Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar or Tejashwi Yadav, could make a mark due to their connection with the grassroots, running an effective campaign and playing the victim card aggressively in the face of the BJP juggernaut.\n\nThere have been pluses for the BJP side too. The TINA (There Is No Alternative) factor has been working in favour of Mr Modi. Besides, both Mr Modi and Amit Shah are known to be hard taskmasters when it comes to fighting the polls.\n\nA section in the BJP, however, insists Mr Modi is the past master in the polarisation game. His Hindu-Muslim rhetoric has silently mobilised the majority and the Hindutva card will be seen in action. It feels a sizeable section of Hindus don't buy the caste census logic, which it feels is past its expiry date.\n\nThe reporters of a news website not known to be Modi admirers insisted that what they saw during the campaign was that the BJP was very much on the ground and fighting hard.\n\nBut the experience was also that in states like Uttar Pradesh, the BJP was suffering some losses due to its failure to change candidates. For the Opposition, the lesson of the 2024 election season is that you cannot win a poll if you start preparing at the last moment and fail to project a united face.\n\nIn West Bengal, where chief minister Mamata Banerjee appears under intense pressure, the Trinamul boss broke ranks with her I.N.D.I.A. allies to ensure that only the TMC gets the maximum number of seats.\n\nThere have been minuses too for the BJP. Despite being hailed as \"Sher\" by his supporters, Mr Modi was at a loss to clinch an issue that would drive a big wedge in the rival camp and take the poll battle into their territory.\n\nIssues like price rise, unemployment and growing inequality raised by the Opposition did have resonance in the polls.\n\nOn the face of it, it did not appear that Hindutva has raised much crescendo in the minds of the majority community.\n\nThe Prime Minister's failure to correctly gauge the mood of the people by harping on the right issues and raising the pitch speaks poorly of the mighty election machinery of the world's largest party. How can they go so wrong?\n\nMr Modi has been good at sensing the mood of the people and this was seen in 2014 and 2019.\n\nThis time, he was like a character in the story in which some blind men were asked to specify their impression about the elephant. So, shooting in the dark, Mr Modi used all cards: Ram Mandir, Pakistan, dynasty, appeasement politics. The name of the game was polarisation.\n\nTwo decades back, Subhash Ghai had come out with a film Yaadein, which was sold out at exorbitant rates in all regions and the music rights too fetched much moolah. But the film flopped at the box office, leaving just Yaadein.\n\nOne thing did happen after Yaadein. Ghai was no longer the magic man of Bollywood. Tuesday will reveal the fate of Mr Modi, but one thing is clear -- this was not his best election.",

        "title": "A vote for regional aspirations in Sikkim",
        "body": "In 1975, the people of Sikkim, comprising indigenous Lepcha, Bhutia, and Nepali ethno-cultural groups, became citizens of India. Since then, they have remained hostile to the imposition of what they see as nationalist projects. Sikkim has always been ruled by regional forces; its politics is embedded in the lived experience of the Sikkimese people. The results of the 2024 Assembly elections in the State once again reinforce this.\n\nThe elections were seen as a contest between the ruling Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) and the Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF). The SKM stormed back to power winning 31 of the 32 Assembly seats. The leader of the SDF, the five-time Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling, lost both the seats he contested. The SDF managed to win just one seat.\n\nIn Sikkim, NOTA outdid Congress; CM got more votes than 31 BJP candidates\n\nThe SKM's victory can be attributed to many reasons. The first is the shift in narrative. SKM leader Prem Singh Tamang highlighted the SDF's predicament in delivering Scheduled Tribe (ST) representation for Limbu-Tamang communities in the State Assembly, and promised parivartan (change). He also mobilised the sentiments of about 11 Nepali communities which have not been granted ST status yet.\n\nSecond, Mr. Tamang appealed to younger voters. The SKM's 'vote for jobs' narrative struck a chord with the people. It equally allowed the incumbent Chief Minister to change his image. Mr. Tamang had been convicted in a graft case and served a one-year term in prison between 2017 and 2018. This attracted the provisions of the Representation of People Act, debarring him from being an electoral candidate for six years from the date he was released. The Election Commission in 2019 reduced the disqualification by almost five years. The Opposition has been protesting that Mr. Tamang's swearing-in in May 2019 was illegal. But people's memories are short and Mr. Tamang is now known as a pro-people Chief Minister.\n\nP.S. Tamang: A CM better known by his nickname\n\nThird, the SKM was also imaginative with its social media campaigns compared to the SDF and BJP. This also appealed to the younger voters.\n\nThe mandate that the SKM has received reveals a political space bereft of a credible Opposition and brings four decades of Mr. Chamling's dominance to a closure.\n\nAssembly Elections 2024: Sikkim Assembly results at a glance\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) contested the election in the backdrop of the Finance Act of 2023, which expanded the definition of Sikkimese beyond Lepcha, Bhutia, and Nepali to include 'other' Indian citizens settled in Sikkim. This apparent effort to enfranchise non-Sikkimese in the Sikkimese political space caused concern. There was also fear following the dilution of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir that the government would dilute Article 371F of the Constitution, which provides for the unique status of Sikkim. It is not surprising then that many BJP MLAs switched to the SKM. The BJP's candidates, who were mostly from the upper castes, did not do enough to appeal to the regional aspirations.\n\nThe crowd-funded Citizen Action Party-Sikkim also failed to create an impact. Its narrative of reform was too idealistic and did not strike a chord.\n\nSikkim Krantikari Morcha: The second-time victorious dissident\n\nThe Congress did not even deem it fit to visit Sikkim during its Bharat Jodo Yatra. Nor did the party, which was responsible for Sikkim's integration with India, use history to dispel fears about the loss of autonomy and identity.\n\nIn the absence of Opposition legislators in the Sikkim Assembly, how will the delimitation exercise take place in 2026? Is the BJP likely to pitch for non-Sikkimese representation in the Sikkim Assembly? If the BJP-SKM alliance was a liability for State politics, does the absolute verdict in favour of the SKM mean that the people want a strong Chief Minister? It is crucial to note that Sikkim and Mizoram are outliers in the north-east, where the BJP otherwise dominates the political landscape.\n\nAmong other things, the verdict shows a preference to maintain the regional status quo. In this context, the SKM would do well to revisit the implementation of some Central laws in Sikkim. It could pass a resolution in the Assembly against the implementation of the Finance Act and work towards preserving the Sikkim subject. It could also help in the fight to obtain ST status for certain communities and give representation to the Limbu-Tamangs. This will not only reinforce but restore Sikkimese agency and autonomy.\n\nSunil Pradhan is a Sikkim-based political consultant\n\nRead Comments",

(File | PTI)\n\nMaharashtra, the second-largest state in the Lok Sabha elections with 48 seats, plays a crucial role not only for the ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) but also for the Opposition's INDIA bloc in challenging Narendra Modi's bid for a historic third term as Prime Minister of India.\n\nThe entire country is closely watching the developments and the fiercely contested Lok Sabha battle in the land of the medieval Maratha king, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, known for his guerrilla warfare tactics. Maharashtra's diverse regions resemble Europe's variety in dialects and food culture, yet historically, the state has decisively chosen one side in Lok Sabha elections.\n\nIn the 2019 general elections, 60.95% (5,40,54,245) of eligible voters cast their votes. In 2024, this increased slightly to 61.33% (5,70,06,778), marking a 0.33% increase (29,52,533), according to the Election Commission. During the five-phase 2024 polls, Gadchiroli-Chimur led with a 71.88% turnout, followed by Kolhapur at 71.59%, Hatkanangale at 71.11%, Beed at 70.92%, and Nandurbar at 70.68%. The lowest turnout was 50.06% in the Mumbai South\n\nIn the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA secured 41 seats, with 23 for BJP and 18 for the united Shiv Sena, while the Opposition managed only six seats (four for NCP, two for Congress, and one for Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan). The NDA's vote share was over 47%, while the Opposition had only 34%.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA retained its 41 seats, with BJP and Shiv Sena maintaining their respective tallies and a combined vote share of over 50%. The Opposition again performed poorly, winning only five seats (four for NCP, one for Congress) with a 32% vote share. The Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) won one seat in Aurangabad.\n\nThe BJP focused its campaign on nationalist issues like the abolition of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the construction of the Ram temple, and the image of India under PM Modi. The Opposition highlighted inflation, unemployment, and alleged hidden agendas of the BJP-RSS, promising financial support for women, stipends for unemployed youths, loan waivers for farmers, and legal guarantees for minimum support prices (MSP) for crops.\n\nThe INDIA bloc, meanwhile, aimed to localise the elections by adopting a local and state-centric name for its alliance: the Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprising the Congress, Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT), and Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP). Uddhav Thackeray not only contested the highest number of Lok Sabha seats within the MVA, with 21, but also emerged as a star campaigner and a key factor in this election.",

Key opposition leaders, including former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, NCP's Supriya Sule, and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, are also contesting the poll.\n\nAlso Read | Lok Sabha Election Results 2024: Central Forces to Control Security in and Around LS Poll Counting Centres in North East States.\n\nHere is a look at some key contests involving prominent leaders:\n\n1. Narendra Modi: Prime Minister Modi, is seeking a third term from Varanasi, the constituency that paved his way to the Lok Sabha after his stint as Chief Minister. He is pitted against Congress leader and INDIA bloc candidate Ajay Rai. PM Modi won the seat by huge margins in 2014 and 2019.\n\nAlso Read | Bengaluru Rains: City Breaks 133-Year-Old Record, Sees Highest Rainfall in June As Southwest Monsoon Advances Further in Some Parts of South Peninsula.\n\n2. Amit Shah: The Union Home Minister entered the Lok Sabha in 2019 from Gandhinagar and is seeking his second straight term from the seat, which has been held by BJP veterans in the past. Shah, who earlier served as BJP President, is against Congress candidate Sonal Patel.\n\n3. Rahul Gandhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is contesting the Lok Sabha elections from two seats -- Wayanad and Raebareli. Gandhi, who lost the family bastion seat of Amethi in 2019 and entered the Lok Sabha from Wayanad, is aiming to maintain the party's lone bastion left in the state. He is up against BJP's Dinesh Pratap Singh and BJP's K. Surendran, as well as CPI-M's Annie Raja in Wayanad.\n\n4. Supriya Sule and Sunetra Pawar: The Baramati constituency is another 'hot seat' that will decide the future of the 'Pawar' legacy. NCP supremo Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule is against his cousin Ajit Pawar's wife, Sunetra Pawar, from the seat. The exit polls have predicted a tight contest.\n\n5. Shashi Tharoor: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, who is a three-time MP from Thiruvananthapuram, is facing a three-way contest against BJP's Rajeev Chandrasekhar and CPI-M's Panniyan Ravindran.

        "title": "Trust in continuity: The Hindu Editorial on the Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim results",
        "body": "The Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim mandates are for status quo\n\nThe verdicts to the Assembly elections in India's easternmost and smallest State by population, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, respectively, might not be a harbinger of what is to come in the 2024 general election. But the decisive victories achieved by the incumbent parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Arunachal Pradesh and the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) in Sikkim, indicate that the electorates in two States, overwhelmingly, preferred continuity over change. Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu and his party received a strong mandate, winning 46 out of the 60 seats and increasing the BJP's tally even further by five seats. Mr. Khandu enjoys the reputation of running a stable government in the State, far from the tumultuous period in 2016 when he took over the reins. With a focus on welfare delivery and infrastructure development that has further connected the State to the rest of the country, Mr. Khandu has earned the confidence of the electorate. The BJP-friendly parties, the National People's Party and the People's Party of Arunachal, also registered five and two wins each, while the Opposition Congress's tally was reduced to just one seat. Supporters of the BJP and its main leader, Mr. Khandu, would celebrate the fact that in 10 out of the 60 seats there was no contest, which limited the chances of any upset. But this does not bode well for the State as a robust contestation of ideas and policies is a must for a functioning democracy.\n\nArunachal Pradesh would do well not to go the Nagaland way where, technically, there is no opposition as all the parties that contested against the BJP-Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party coalition joined the alliance after the elections in 2023. In Sikkim, the SKM, led by Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang won 31 out of the 32 seats, with a lone seat going to the erstwhile dominant Sikkim Democratic Front. The SKM's victory in a multi-cornered fight was made possible by the regional assertion by the party which mobilised support on the issue of retaining Sikkim's special status enshrined in Article 371F of the Constitution, on Mr. Tamang's promises to deliver Scheduled Tribe status to some Nepali-origin communities, and his emphasis on job creation in the State. Sikkim's ruling party might have fought against the BJP and the latter might have drawn a blank, but the SKM still considers the BJP an ally. Notwithstanding the strong identity based politics in the north-east, voters choose the national party ruling at the Centre or its ally, dependent as these States are on central government funds. The overwhelming mandate in his favour should help Mr. Tamang, who will have to use all of his diplomatic powers to ensure benefits from the Union government.\n\nRead Comments",

        "title": "Global Markets Steady Despite Wall Street Decline | Business",
        "body": "Global markets steadied on Monday despite declines on Wall Street triggered by weak U.S. manufacturing data. The European Central Bank's anticipated interest rate cut and China's robust factory growth offered a mixed outlook. Ongoing economic uncertainties influenced notable market movements across currencies, stocks, and commodities.\n\nWorld stocks steadied on Monday despite declines on Wall Street following data that showed unexpected weakness in U.S. manufacturing activity, adding to uncertainty about the U.S. interest rate outlook. The cloudy outlook for U.S. rates contrasts with Europe, where investors are looking forward to a 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the European Central Bank on Thursday, which would bring the benchmark rate down to 3.75%.\n\nBy 1807 GMT, the MSCI All Country World Price Index added 0.17%. U.S. stocks stayed in the red, amid a reported technical glitch on the New York Stock Exchange regarding \"Limit Up-Limit Down\" bands that sent dozen of stocks listed on the exchange into volatility pauses. The exchange said it was investigating the problem and will provide information as soon as possible.\n\nThe S&P 500 index fell 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite bucked the downtrend and edged up 0.1%. The pan-European STOXX index was up 0.32%. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields fell to a two-week low and the dollar tumbled after data showed that U.S. manufacturing activity slowed for a second straight month in May, as new goods orders dropped by the most in nearly two years.\n\nThe soft data supported some speculation that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates this year, although some investors remained sceptical about the chance of rate cuts with inflation standing above its 2% target. \"We see inflation limiting how much central banks can cut interest rates,\" Jean Boivin, the head of Blackrock Investment Institute, said. \"We see them keeping rates high for longer.\"\n\nBenchmark 10-year note yields were last down 11 basis points at 4.4021%, and got as low as 4.404%, the lowest since May 16. Two-year note yields fell 7 basis points to 4.823% and reached 4.816%, also the lowest since May 21. In Europe, even though the ECB is considered almost certain to trim rates on Thursday, last week's surprisingly strong euro zone inflation data further weakened the case for a rapid round of reductions.\n\nMarkets now price in fewer than 60 basis points of easing - meaning two 25-basis-point cuts and less than a 50% chance of a third. \"There's a relatively positive risk tone to start the week, which seems like a continuation of the positive momentum seen on Friday, albeit it is somewhat surprising given the bumper calendar of event risk coming up,\" said Michael Brown, strategist at broker Pepperstone in London.\n\nChina's factory activity grew at the fastest pace in about two years in May, data showed on Monday. That extended the optimism prevailing in markets following Friday figures showing the U.S. Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation held steady in April. \"The ECB decision is perhaps the most important event to watch, particularly after last week's inflation data which raises the hawkish risk that there is only one more cut this year after a 25bp reduction on Thursday,\" Brown said.\n\nMarkets also imply around an 80% chance the Bank of Canada will cut rates at its meeting on Wednesday and around 60 basis points of easing this year, though analysts are hopeful the easing will be even deeper. ASIAN STRENGTH\n\nThe dollar fell to a three-week low after the weak U.S. manufacturing data. The dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency's value versus six major currencies, slipped 0.37% to 104.2. The greenback also fell to a two-week low against the yen following the data and was last down 0.6% at 156.245.\n\nThe euro rose 0.4% against the dollar to $1.08893. In other currencies, the Mexican peso weakened on Monday after the ruling party declared Claudia Sheinbaum the winner of the presidential election by a \"large margin\" after polls closed on Sunday. The U.S. dollar was last up 4.5% at 17.754 pesos .\n\nIndia's rupee strengthened and its stock market rose to a record high, buoyed by expectations of sustained economic growth as Prime Minister Narendra Modi looked set for a third term. Gold was up 0.9% at $2,347.55 an ounce, having now rallied for four months in a row, helped in part by buying from central banks and China.\n\nOil prices slumped after OPEC+ agreed on Sunday to extend most of its oil output cuts into 2025, though some cuts will start to be unwound from October 2024 onwards. Some analysts described the group's complicated decision, agreed on Sunday, as incrementally bearish for oil prices. Brent tumbled 3.5% to $78.24 a barrel, while U.S. crude dropped 3.78% to $74.07 per barrel.\n\nEuropean natural gas prices rose more than 8% to their highest this year at over 37 euros/ MWh as an outage in Norway, which overtook Russia in 2022 as Europe's biggest gas supplier, pushed exports sharply lower on Monday. ($1 = 157.1900 yen)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Results are set to be announced on Tuesday (June 4). The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to come back to power and continue its dominance. Exit polls predicted a clear victory for the saffron party. On the other hand, the INDIA alliance has confidently claimed it will secure over 295 seats.",

        "body": "It must be said that seasonal changes in weather influence the number of foreign tourist arrivals in India. Consequently, significant reductions in visitor numbers are observed during the monsoon season. Goa, one of the most happening destinations in the world, is famous for its sunny beaches. Since tourism-related activity is the prime revenue earner for the state, it seems necessary for the government to make all efforts to promote Goa as a 365-day tourist destination. This is why promoting the state as a monsoon tourism destination assumes significance. Goa has a lot to offer visitors during the monsoon season. The springs and waterfalls are in full force, there is greenery everywhere, the beaches are clean and deserted, and river cruises have become even more attractive. Plus, there are attractive off-season discounts as well. This is precisely why more and more tourists are now visiting Goa during the monsoon season. This piece of heaven looks the prettiest when the rain washes the dust away. Like every other coastal region, the monsoon in Goa brings with it drizzling heavy rain and thundershowers. Goa has two wonderful islands, namely Chorao and Divar, that can be explored during the monsoon. The fresh, green, and raw beauty at these sites makes for an experience one just cannot miss. Goa is home to abundant wildlife in its dense tropical forests. So going on wildlife safari tours is something that attracts nature lovers. The Dudhsagar waterfall is a must-visit place for every traveller. This waterfall becomes all the more beautiful during the monsoon, when it literally swells up with excess water. However, swimming in the water is prohibited. The iconic waterfalls are surrounded by dense greenery, which makes for a good trekking trip. This is also the best time to visit spice plantations.\n\nThe general elections are over, and the economy is on track for higher growth, which is good news. There is life after this election. We need to bury the hatchet, stop our obsession with who wins and who loses, and focus on the future. Those who take a keen interest in economic growth might have gotten the taste of the growth chart going up. The growth rate is an impressive 8.2% due to a higher than expected increase of 7.8% in the last quarter and that is quite significant. In fact, the expansion is higher than the RBI's earlier forecast of 7%. This is the ninth time since 1961-62 that the economy has recorded 8% growth. Importantly, the growth numbers by themselves failed to get votes unless there was a real increase in the employment rate. The challenge for the next government was to create jobs at a faster rate, along with a faster rate of economic growth. The writing is on the wall and the people expect a lot in the next five years to become the third-highest economy in the next five years. The aim of the government is high, and the stake is very much in our favour.\n\nBefore the onset of the monsoon, which is a high transmission season for vector-borne diseases like dengue, the authorities in the government health services in Karnataka must devise a strategy and closely monitor the dengue situation in vulnerable hotspots across the state. Additionally, government teams need to visit locations where cases are reported, inspect for potential breeding sites, and raise awareness among residents about dengue prevention measures. The unit responsible for the National Vector-borne Disease Control Programme should ensure that crucial prevention guidelines are rigorously followed at the household level to effectively eliminate dengue. Local communities must be urged to join the fight against dengue by monitoring and eliminating stagnant water in courtyards and discarded items. Over the past two to three years, Karnataka has seen a steady increase in dengue cases, resulting in deaths.\n\nA year after the implementation of the AI (artificial intelligence) camera pilot project at Merces Circle, Panaji, the transport department is set to net a bumper Rs 3 crore in fines after drivers were e-challaned for overspeeding and jumping red lights. The project, which aimed to enhance traffic management and safety through automated surveillance and enforcement mechanisms, saw the Goa traffic police rein in law-breaking motorists to a significant extent. Data indicates a steep drop in overspeeding violations, from 5,300 in June 2023 to 1,900 in May 2024. Similarly, cases of vehicles jumping signals declined from 6,400 last year to 3,100 this year. The AI camera monitoring system is a pilot project, but taking cognizance of the positive results, it should be rolled out across the state. Also, other violations like helmetless riding should be added to the list of detections. Technology used for law enforcement will also ensure that road fatalities, for which Goa has a dubious record, will reduce.\n\nInvestors' wealth jumped Rs 12.48 lakh crore, and non-deliverable rupee forwards traded at $83.11 in morning trade on Monday as the benchmark equity index Sensex hit its lifetime high after exit polls, which only served to sow more confusion in the minds of the electorate. It is worth remembering that such predictions are off the mark a lot of times, particularly who forgets 'Shinning India' of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime? (Do we really need them?) pointed to a third term and a sizable mandate for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom investors hope will spend on infrastructure and manufacturing to keep economic growth going. The counting of votes for the Lok Sabha elections, which took place in seven phases, will take place on June 4. Investors should be prepared for fluctuations but can remain optimistic about a potential rally if the final results align with the exit polls. Though I have doubts in mind, even then, it could lead to a significant surge in the stock prices of companies dubbed 'Modi stocks.' However, the final outcome, if in line with exit polls, would likely calm investor nerves, as political and policy continuity will be good for risk assets in the immediate run and macro stability in the medium term.",
