This will cover not only the Lok Sabha elections but also the state legislative assemblies of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, along with various bye-elections.\\n\\nFor the latest updates on the Lok Sabha election results, you can visit the official Election Commission of India (ECI) website: https://results.eci.gov.in/. These updates will also be accessible via the Voter Helpline App, compatible with both iOS and Android devices.\\n\\nTo experience comprehensive coverage, constituency wise updates and debates, the election results will be live-streamed on various news channels, YouTube channels, and social media accounts of major news outlets. Enthusiasts of large screen experience in Maharashtra, including Mumbai, can watch the 2024 Lok Sabha election results live in theatres as well as MovieMax will showcase the event titled 'Election Results 2024' starting at 9 AM.\\n\\nUnder Rule 54 A of the Conduct of Elections Rules 1961, the process for counting votes starts with postal ballots at the Returning Officer's (RO) table. Thirty minutes into postal ballot counting, Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) votes can be counted, or immediately if no postal ballots are present.\\n\\nCounting officials must ensure that the EVM's Control Unit (CU) seal is intact and that the total votes match Form 17C before counting. Results from the CU are recorded in Part-II of Form 17C, verified by the counting supervisor, micro observer, and candidate agents. If the CU's display fails, VVPAT slips are counted post CU counting.\\n\\nResults for each CU are documented and signed in Form 17C, which is then sent for compiling the final result in Form 20. VVPAT slip counting starts after CU votes are counted, with mandatory verification of VVPAT slips from five random polling stations per constituency. If the victory margin is less than the rejected postal ballots, those ballots are re-verified before declaring the result. In case of a tie, the winner is determined by a draw of lots.\"}, {'article': 'Phew! Tomorrow as ballot boxes are counted we shall know who will sit on India\\'s Raj gaddi in this hard-fought theeka-dhuandhar elections. Encapsulated brilliantly in an adage: Poll is a right whore. She often gives but also takes away all in one fell swoop. Even as all exit polls predict BJP Modi\\'s clean sweep, INDIA bloc\\'s Congress tom-tom their victory. Either which way in politics it\\'s not over till it\\'s over and jo jeeta wohi sikander!\\n\\nUndeniably, Election 2024 is easily the most polarising one in recent electoral history. Forget mutual antipathy and mistrust, it is an election which spewed hatred between communities on religious basis to polarise people built on those supporting Modi or his INDIA bloc opponents with barely any meeting ground between the two which was violated on a scale never seen before.\\n\\nAlso, unlike 2014 or 2019, 2024 was most Presidential, selling Brand Modi whereby the Party and its candidates were secondary to the Gaurantee called Modi. Of course, the Prime Minister led a grueling campaign seeking a third term with no challenger. While, the Opposition which appeared divided, jaded and listless at first managed to get its act together and mounted an aggressive counter against BJP. But, was hamstrung when it came to countering the NaMo cult.\\n\\nThis election stands testimony to Congress decline when it fielded the lowest number of candidates ever totaling 294 of 543 Lok Sabha seats. Surprising, as bhai-behen Rahul-Priyanka duo did show signs of reviving its deflated cadres, but desperate to stop Modi from returning to power continues to be confused about its support base and fell back on its tried and tested formula -- abuse and corruption as poll plank.\\n\\nCampaigning for a greater part appealed to bad-mouthing opponents preaching fire and brimstone sermons. Worse, the political discourse has never been more neech, gross, coarse, divisive, inflammatory and pungent sans any debate on vital issues debilitating the nation. Be it citizenry\\'s needs and wants, unemployment, healthcare, farmers distress and rising food inflation. Making plain our democratic process is severely under strain with none caring a damn for the Election Commission\\'s (EC) Model Code of Conduct.\\n\\nWith polls being all about rah-rahs and unsavoury put-downs, which sadly, voters seem to have accepted as par for the course. Notwithstanding, EC trying, though half-heartedly, to rein in \\'star campaigners\\' across the political spectrum. Alongside our leaders\\' obsession with the numbers game: seats won, vote shares, voter turnout, number of rallies and size etc. Yet, beyond quantity, the quality left a lot wanting.\\n\\nCertainly, Opposition left no stone unturned to raise questions on flaws in electoral rolls, efficacy of EVMs, alleged fudging of voter turnout figures and attempts to influence 150 District Magistrates and collectors yet no substantive evidence was put forth. Besides, there were no complaints from candidates and those receiving Form 17 C which records votes polled in a booth, said Election Commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar yesterday.\\n\\nClearing the air on various allegations against the Commission, CEC asserted, \"the one making allegations was present in the kachahari but there was no gavah. He also commented on memes on social media describing the EC as \\'Laapata gentlemen\\' for being absent amid MCC violations by top leaders during electioneering, clarifying that he and two fellow Commissioners were \"never out and always here. We issued 100 press notes and advisories.\"\\n\\nPatting itself, CEC averred only 39 re-polls were held as opposed to 540 in 2019 while 27 States didn\\'t require re-polling. For resons best known to him, he discounted poll violence, obviously turning a blind eye to major incidents in West Bengal.\\n\\nHowever, the EC was found wanting in taking action to ensure parties respected the MCC. Resulting in a perception, the three wise men allowed MCC to be violated and were too lenient about transgressions of BJP and its leaders, especially in censuring leaders indulging in hate speech. Besides, the delay in releasing voter turnout has cast a cloud on its reputation.\\n\\nOpposition leaders call the EC a paper tiger and for being extremely partisan leading to its functioning and impartiality being profoundly degraded. Recently, it banned AAP\\'s official campaign song on the pretext it showed \"BJP and its agencies in poor light\". If this was a criteria does it not amount to a muzzling of criticism and accountability, the life-breath of democracy?\\n\\nOn the other hand, it turned a blind eye when BJP ran explicit dog-whistling campaigns targeting Muslims or when it spread canards about the Congress manifesto. Also, when Modi created a false impression that people\\'s money and women\\'s mangalsutras would be taken away in the name of wealth redistribution and given to \"infiltrators\" and \"those who have more children\", EC sent a notice not to Modi but BJP Chief Nadda. Clearly, the institution has a problem in hand.\\n\\nBesides, even as institutions may be under strain in the backdrop of all-round decline in conversation but competitive electoral democracy at the grassroots level is alive and kicking. And no leader, however popular, can take the voter for granted. Every vote has to be fought for with hard work, by hard selling promises and achievements and unfortunately, not by stoking fears about what might be.\\n\\nThe good thing is the electorate knew its choices and seemed unwilling to be impressed by legacy, placing a premium on record. The bad thing: Being enamoured by freebies and all too susceptible to polarizing rhetoric.\\n\\nAt the same time even as elections are all about competition and campaigns do leaders need to stoop so low as to manufacture fears, and then personally malign opponents to win votes? Modi\\'s speeches were filled with anti-Muslim verbose while Opposition created a scare over possible amendments to the Constitution to take away benefits of reservation.\\n\\nUndeniably, these dog whisles vitiated the atmosphere and lowered the dignity of discourse. A nation which prides itself in being the mother of democracy needs to do better when it comes to language of electioneering.\\n\\nIn the ultimate, as one does a cost-benefit analysis time for our polity to realize they can disagree without being disagreeable, be critical yet engaging and constructive. Voters too need to demand more of our netagan and go beyond sharing images of inked fingers proof of \\'job done.\\'\\n\\nPerhaps the time has come for Parties to get a complete makeover, good politicians and a new set of rules which fight for policies and problems that bother their electorate and uphold the ideals of democracy. The dignity of the electoral process which draws a lakshman rekha on vulgarity and vows not to cross it. Along-with overhauling the election apparatus.\\n\\nOnce the heat and dust of this gigantic exercise involving over one crore polling personnel, the unsung heroes, to elect 543 Lok Sabha MPs dissipates and settles down, both the supply and demand side of governance will mature in quality, and not just in quantity.\\n\\nTrue, it might be wishful thinking to even think that this narrative will return to normal and business as usual once polls are over. Primarily as they could leave our polity and society divided and scarred. Whereby a lot of time, effort and statesmanship will be required to undo the damage.\\n\\nTime our leaders understand that Prime Ministers will come and go but their words will stay. Which will influence young minds and teach them to show dignity and respect for others. The lead will have to be taken by none other than the next Prime Minister. -- -- INFA'}, {'article': 'The outcome of the long-drawn-out polling for Mandate 2024 will be out on Tuesday. This was arguably one of the most polarising general election campaigns the country has witnessed. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi led a grueling campaign, seeking a third term in office for the BJP. On the other hand, the opposition which appeared divided, jaded, and listless at the beginning of the elections managed to get its act together and mounted an aggressive counter against the ruling party. It witnessed fierce debate. The campaign was deeply communal with minority Muslim bashing becoming the norm during the campaign.\\n\\nThe campaign revealed one thing about India.

India has proved that it has the electoral democracy in its DNA that gives expression to the public opinion to govern the nation. The public participation to choose the new Lok Sabha and the new national government is testimony to the maturity of the Indian nation when conflict has become the hallmark in the modern democracies of the world. India has stood the test of the time when it comes to upholding the parliamentary democracy.2024 Lok Sabha Election has proved without any doubt that there may be difference of political ideologies among the political parties both at the regional and the national level. But when it comes to national governance then the most difficult political disagreements are insignificant and national interest takes the centre stage. This year the percentage of voting has crossed the previous records in the conflict zones and people have come out in large numbers to cast their vote. People in Jammu and Kashmir have proved many political pundits wrong. The poll percentage has crossed the previous records. Kashmir valley has underlined the power of the ballot and rejected the regression of the bullet. The \"Naya Kashmir \" has invested its vote for the comprehensive development and peace in the valley. This election in the aftermath of the neutralisation of Article 370 and 35A signifies the change of mood. And the mood is for sending representatives to the parliament who can express the people\\'s aspirations and get them operationalized through policies. If the writing on the wall is read carefully then it can be said with utmost confidence and conviction that the people in Jammu and Kashmir want the Assembly Elections to be conducted in consonance with the Supreme Court Direction by September. This mood must not be squandered. Aspirations of the people must get redressal to be stakeholders in the national resurgence. The cause for confidence of the voters all over India has another reason and that is the strong centre. In the last two decades India has witnessed a stable government. This has led to development of faith in the people that their votes are valuable weapons to shape the destiny of the nation. The improvement in the internal security, upgradation of the national security, economic boom, strong foreign policy and above all a leadership guided by conviction that governs on the principle of the nation first. It would not be an exaggeration that the Modi factor has led the voters to cast their votes. Prime Minister has been able to reach the voters through his policies at the grass root level with a segmented approach. This has paid dividends and made voters reinforce their faith in the national festival of the Lok Sabha Election with rejuvenation. No one will be surprised to see the seat tally tomorrow. The Lok Sabha Election 2024 is a referendum for the \"Nation First\" and everyone knows what that means. Opposition has been lac lustre as far as its election manifestos are concerned. And what has added to the crisis in the INDI Alliance camp is the absence of the mutually accepted national leader who can deliver and appeal to the masses. The reason being that Narendra Modi has set high standards when it comes to leadership. So the Lok Sabha Verdict 2024 is a foregone conclusion that the Indian Nation will repeat the strong leadership that has delivered on national issues.'}, {'article': 'At eight in the morning, the long eighty-day voting process will come to an end with the counting.

(PTI Image)\\n\\nA painfully long general election in our hottest summer has finally ended. The tea leaves will be read in the exit polls that were released on Saturday evening, but one must keep in mind their imperfect record. Even for a single state, West Bengal, which held Assembly elections in the summer of 2021, one out of four got the result wrong. Opinion polls, conducted before this longest cycle of elections was announced, were unanimous that the BJP would get a majority.\\n\\nToday, some are not sure this will be the case, but we shall see. Without knowing the results, however, what can be said about the election that is still important? Let us work our way through the possibilities.\\n\\nThe first is that no matter who wins, this was not a free or fair election. Two chief ministers were jailed before the campaigning began. Jailed not because they were convicted but because the BJP wanted them jailed. One of them was released for a few days of campaigning, but will have to return to jail now.\\n\\nThe access to bank accounts of the Opposition was restricted, through attacks made by the Central investigative agencies controlled by the BJP. The Election Commission compromised itself, sadly, and allowed the BJP to control both the planning of the phases and their execution. The commission\\'s insolent replies to the Opposition, its refusal to act on the Prime Minister\\'s hate speeches against Muslims and its refusal to release the poll data on time has harmed our democracy. The electoral bonds scheme was determined to be unconstitutional, but thousands of crores raised under it were used in this election, and this has tainted it, quite irredeemably in my opinion.\\n\\nNext, let\\'s look at what the possibilities are. Since the opinion polls were unanimous, the most likely one may seem to be that Narendra Modi returns to office with a similarly large majority. What should one expect in that case? More of the same, of course. He has run the nation as one would a monarchy and his ministers are courtiers (see their social media accounts bleating his glories). The Opposition parties will continue to be attacked through the misuse of official agencies, civil society will be force-marched towards extinction and India\\'s plummeting on the global indices will continue. The minorities, and especially Muslims, will continue to have open season declared on them. The institutions will continue on their path of decline. The consolidation of what a former chief economic adviser has referred to as \"the two As\" will continue, meaning a corporate capture of the economy. In short, what we see around us today will remain as it is.\\n\\nIt is unhealthy to have a single-party state, as has happened in Gujarat. The Opposition exists, but only on sufferance. What happened to opponents and prospective candidates in Surat and in Varanasi will repeat in more places.\\n\\nIt should be conceded that if he wins again, Narendra Modi will be the most successful leader we have seen in our history, and delivering three consecutive Lok Sabha wins after three Assembly wins all with absolute majorities will be a singular achievement.\\n\\nThe second possibility is that the BJP gets a plurality of seats but not an absolute majority. Say, they get 250 seats and form the government. In this case, the situation changes in several ways. First, the allies will begin to assert themselves and it will no longer be possible for the king to ignore the courtiers. Does Mr Modi have it in him to function in a more democratic manner? No. This will make such a government a whole lot more volatile.\\n\\nWithin the party, there will be people wanting to assert themselves. The old men in Nagpur, always playing the long game, will raise their heads and become more visible.\\n\\nSome of the things will shift, though the attack on minorities is likely to continue, because that happens at the level of the states, where in several places the BJP enjoys a certain popularity because of its bigotry. The attack on federalism will recede. Today, India is federal only in name. The states have no power to tax after GST and the unhappiness of many has broken out into the open. Law and order continues to be a state subject, but from Delhi to Jharkhand to Karnataka to Bengal, the Union government has sent out its agencies to undermine state governments and chief ministers. With the Union government as strong and unwilling to change as it has been, there has been no attempt at redressal. An alliance government will likely alter that and this will be good for our country.\\n\\nThe last possibility is, of course, that the BJP loses. On the evidence of the opinion polls, this is the least likely possibility but one that we have to consider. To my mind, this will be a good outcome and not because of personal preferences entirely. Democracy renews and refreshes itself with changes in government. One man presiding for decades -- take Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong Un -- rarely produces anything positive. Some of the things, many of them in fact, that we have taken on since 2014 need to be got rid of.

But elections are the only way in which changes take place structurally.'}, {'article': 'India awaits verdict: 2024 Lok Sabha election results to determine Modi\\'s fate\\n\\nOn Tuesday, June 4, the nation will learn who will come to power after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections with the announcement of the much-awaited results that will decide the fate of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP, the world\\'s largest party, as well as of the Opposition parties.\\n\\nBut before the actual counting, much drama and dispute has been seen over the exit poll predictions that have spoken of a landslide for the BJP under Mr Modi.\\n\\nIt has curiously run into a controversy with the Opposition seeking to dismiss the findings and insisting it was very much in the race to come to power. Such a counter-offensive by the opposition is an unprecedented move, turning the whole situation a little bizarre.\\n\\nShiv Sena\\'s Sanjay Raut, himself a journalist, claimed the Opposition I.N.D.I.A. grouping is thick in the game and could win 295 of the total 543 seats, which has added much curiosity as to what is in store. His claim came a day after the meeting of I.N.D.I.A. leaders.\\n\\nNever in the past has any Opposition questioned the outcome of the exit polls in such a forceful manner, questioning the very intent of the polling companies and suggesting that there is more to it than meets the eye.\\n\\nThe nation had seen such a landslide in 1971 and 1984 in the wake of the Bangladesh war and the assassination of Indira Gandhi. In contrast, the 2024 election is a \"normal\" one.\\n\\nThe exit poll predictions show unequivocally that the BJP under Mr Modi is way ahead in the Lok Sabha race against the I.N.D.I.A. grouping, one of whose main constituents is the Congress.\\n\\nThe actual numbers will put a stamp of approval/disapproval on the business of exit polls, pre-poll surveys and such exercises in the world\\'s largest democracy. The outcome is expected to reveal what has weighed on the minds of voters, what has gone wrong for the rival sides and what has helped them. It must be conceded that the just-concluded campaign was the toughest one for Prime Minister Modi, who has been on a winning spree since Gujarat days in 2002.\\n\\nThis election will go down in history as the most puzzling for Mr Modi, as the hero of many an electoral battle who was fighting in the dark this time. Many commentators had claimed that Mr Modi may have missed the bus this time as he had delayed the announcement of the polls, which according to them should have happened in January after the Ram Mandir\\'s inauguration in Ayodhya.\\n\\nThe two-month-long election schedule too looked a bit troublesome with the BJP, which was intended for Mr Modi to have much time for campaigning but appeared too tiring for him for want of a narrative.\\n\\nIf the exit poll predictions prove true, the lesson for the Opposition is that they could be a fighting force in states where they have worked hard and joined hands in fierce combat, and that the same must be replicated at the national level.\\n\\nThe exit polls show that the Opposition is doing much better in states like Maharashtra and Bihar because there they not only worked hard but unitedly too.\\n\\nThe moral of the story is that Mr Modi is not invincible and could be contained or defeated if the Opposition works purposefully with a plan of action and has boots on the ground.\\n\\nThe Opposition leaders, such as Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar or Tejashwi Yadav, could make a mark due to their connection with the grassroots, running an effective campaign and playing the victim card aggressively in the face of the BJP juggernaut.\\n\\nThere have been pluses for the BJP side too. The TINA (There Is No Alternative) factor has been working in favour of Mr Modi. Besides, both Mr Modi and Amit Shah are known to be hard taskmasters when it comes to fighting the polls.\\n\\nA section in the BJP, however, insists Mr Modi is the past master in the polarisation game. His Hindu-Muslim rhetoric has silently mobilised the majority and the Hindutva card will be seen in action. It feels a sizeable section of Hindus don\\'t buy the caste census logic, which it feels is past its expiry date.\\n\\nThe reporters of a news website not known to be Modi admirers insisted that what they saw during the campaign was that the BJP was very much on the ground and fighting hard.\\n\\nBut the experience was also that in states like Uttar Pradesh, the BJP was suffering some losses due to its failure to change candidates. For the Opposition, the lesson of the 2024 election season is that you cannot win a poll if you start preparing at the last moment and fail to project a united face.\\n\\nIn West Bengal, where chief minister Mamata Banerjee appears under intense pressure, the Trinamul boss broke ranks with her I.N.D.I.A. allies to ensure that only the TMC gets the maximum number of seats.\\n\\nThere have been minuses too for the BJP. Despite being hailed as \"Sher\" by his supporters, Mr Modi was at a loss to clinch an issue that would drive a big wedge in the rival camp and take the poll battle into their territory.\\n\\nIssues like price rise, unemployment and growing inequality raised by the Opposition did have resonance in the polls.\\n\\nOn the face of it, it did not appear that Hindutva has raised much crescendo in the minds of the majority community.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister\\'s failure to correctly gauge the mood of the people by harping on the right issues and raising the pitch speaks poorly of the mighty election machinery of the world\\'s largest party. How can they go so wrong?\\n\\nMr Modi has been good at sensing the mood of the people and this was seen in 2014 and 2019.\\n\\nThis time, he was like a character in the story in which some blind men were asked to specify their impression about the elephant. So, shooting in the dark, Mr Modi used all cards: Ram Mandir, Pakistan, dynasty, appeasement politics. The name of the game was polarisation.\\n\\nTwo decades back, Subhash Ghai had come out with a film Yaadein, which was sold out at exorbitant rates in all regions and the music rights too fetched much moolah. But the film flopped at the box office, leaving just Yaadein.\\n\\nOne thing did happen after Yaadein. Ghai was no longer the magic man of Bollywood. Tuesday will reveal the fate of Mr Modi, but one thing is clear -- this was not his best election.'}, {'article': \"In 1975, the people of Sikkim, comprising indigenous Lepcha, Bhutia, and Nepali ethno-cultural groups, became citizens of India. Since then, they have remained hostile to the imposition of what they see as nationalist projects. Sikkim has always been ruled by regional forces; its politics is embedded in the lived experience of the Sikkimese people. The results of the 2024 Assembly elections in the State once again reinforce this.\\n\\nThe elections were seen as a contest between the ruling Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) and the Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF). The SKM stormed back to power winning 31 of the 32 Assembly seats. The leader of the SDF, the five-time Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling, lost both the seats he contested. The SDF managed to win just one seat.\\n\\nIn Sikkim, NOTA outdid Congress; CM got more votes than 31 BJP candidates\\n\\nThe SKM's victory can be attributed to many reasons. The first is the shift in narrative. SKM leader Prem Singh Tamang highlighted the SDF's predicament in delivering Scheduled Tribe (ST) representation for Limbu-Tamang communities in the State Assembly, and promised parivartan (change). He also mobilised the sentiments of about 11 Nepali communities which have not been granted ST status yet.\\n\\nSecond, Mr. Tamang appealed to younger voters. The SKM's 'vote for jobs' narrative struck a chord with the people. It equally allowed the incumbent Chief Minister to change his image. Mr. Tamang had been convicted in a graft case and served a one-year term in prison between 2017 and 2018. This attracted the provisions of the Representation of People Act, debarring him from being an electoral candidate for six years from the date he was released. The Election Commission in 2019 reduced the disqualification by almost five years. The Opposition has been protesting that Mr. Tamang's swearing-in in May 2019 was illegal. But people's memories are short and Mr. Tamang is now known as a pro-people Chief Minister.\\n\\nP.S. Tamang: A CM better known by his nickname\\n\\nThird, the SKM was also imaginative with its social media campaigns compared to the SDF and BJP. This also appealed to the younger voters.\\n\\nThe mandate that the SKM has received reveals a political space bereft of a credible Opposition and brings four decades of Mr. Chamling's dominance to a closure.\\n\\nAssembly Elections 2024: Sikkim Assembly results at a glance\\n\\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) contested the election in the backdrop of the Finance Act of 2023, which expanded the definition of Sikkimese beyond Lepcha, Bhutia, and Nepali to include 'other' Indian citizens settled in Sikkim. This apparent effort to enfranchise non-Sikkimese in the Sikkimese political space caused concern. There was also fear following the dilution of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir that the government would dilute Article 371F of the Constitution, which provides for the unique status of Sikkim. It is not surprising then that many BJP MLAs switched to the SKM. The BJP's candidates, who were mostly from the upper castes, did not do enough to appeal to the regional aspirations.\\n\\nThe crowd-funded Citizen Action Party-Sikkim also failed to create an impact. Its narrative of reform was too idealistic and did not strike a chord.\\n\\nSikkim Krantikari Morcha: The second-time victorious dissident\\n\\nThe Congress did not even deem it fit to visit Sikkim during its Bharat Jodo Yatra. Nor did the party, which was responsible for Sikkim's integration with India, use history to dispel fears about the loss of autonomy and identity.\\n\\nIn the absence of Opposition legislators in the Sikkim Assembly, how will the delimitation exercise take place in 2026? Is the BJP likely to pitch for non-Sikkimese representation in the Sikkim Assembly? If the BJP-SKM alliance was a liability for State politics, does the absolute verdict in favour of the SKM mean that the people want a strong Chief Minister? It is crucial to note that Sikkim and Mizoram are outliers in the north-east, where the BJP otherwise dominates the political landscape.\\n\\nAmong other things, the verdict shows a preference to maintain the regional status quo. In this context, the SKM would do well to revisit the implementation of some Central laws in Sikkim. It could pass a resolution in the Assembly against the implementation of the Finance Act and work towards preserving the Sikkim subject. It could also help in the fight to obtain ST status for certain communities and give representation to the Limbu-Tamangs. This will not only reinforce but restore Sikkimese agency and autonomy.\\n\\nSunil Pradhan is a Sikkim-based political consultant\\n\\nRead Comments\"}, {'article': \"Devendra Fadnavis, Uddhav Thackeray, Amit Shah and Aditya Thackeray in happier times.

The Opposition again performed poorly, winning only five seats (four for NCP, one for Congress) with a 32% vote share. The Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) won one seat in Aurangabad.\\n\\nThe BJP focused its campaign on nationalist issues like the abolition of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the construction of the Ram temple, and the image of India under PM Modi. The Opposition highlighted inflation, unemployment, and alleged hidden agendas of the BJP-RSS, promising financial support for women, stipends for unemployed youths, loan waivers for farmers, and legal guarantees for minimum support prices (MSP) for crops.\\n\\nThe INDIA bloc, meanwhile, aimed to localise the elections by adopting a local and state-centric name for its alliance: the Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprising the Congress, Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT), and Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP).

But the decisive victories achieved by the incumbent parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Arunachal Pradesh and the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) in Sikkim, indicate that the electorates in two States, overwhelmingly, preferred continuity over change. Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu and his party received a strong mandate, winning 46 out of the 60 seats and increasing the BJP's tally even further by five seats. Mr. Khandu enjoys the reputation of running a stable government in the State, far from the tumultuous period in 2016 when he took over the reins. With a focus on welfare delivery and infrastructure development that has further connected the State to the rest of the country, Mr. Khandu has earned the confidence of the electorate. The BJP-friendly parties, the National People's Party and the People's Party of Arunachal, also registered five and two wins each, while the Opposition Congress's tally was reduced to just one seat. Supporters of the BJP and its main leader, Mr. Khandu, would celebrate the fact that in 10 out of the 60 seats there was no contest, which limited the chances of any upset. But this does not bode well for the State as a robust contestation of ideas and policies is a must for a functioning democracy.\\n\\nArunachal Pradesh would do well not to go the Nagaland way where, technically, there is no opposition as all the parties that contested against the BJP-Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party coalition joined the alliance after the elections in 2023. In Sikkim, the SKM, led by Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang won 31 out of the 32 seats, with a lone seat going to the erstwhile dominant Sikkim Democratic Front. The SKM's victory in a multi-cornered fight was made possible by the regional assertion by the party which mobilised support on the issue of retaining Sikkim's special status enshrined in Article 371F of the Constitution, on Mr. Tamang's promises to deliver Scheduled Tribe status to some Nepali-origin communities, and his emphasis on job creation in the State. Sikkim's ruling party might have fought against the BJP and the latter might have drawn a blank, but the SKM still considers the BJP an ally. Notwithstanding the strong identity based politics in the north-east, voters choose the national party ruling at the Centre or its ally, dependent as these States are on central government funds. The overwhelming mandate in his favour should help Mr. Tamang, who will have to use all of his diplomatic powers to ensure benefits from the Union government.\\n\\nRead Comments\"}, {'article': 'Global markets steadied on Monday despite declines on Wall Street triggered by weak U.S. manufacturing data.

The U.S. dollar was last up 4.5% at 17.754 pesos .\\n\\nIndia\\'s rupee strengthened and its stock market rose to a record high, buoyed by expectations of sustained economic growth as Prime Minister Narendra Modi looked set for a third term. Gold was up 0.9% at $2,347.55 an ounce, having now rallied for four months in a row, helped in part by buying from central banks and China.\\n\\nOil prices slumped after OPEC+ agreed on Sunday to extend most of its oil output cuts into 2025, though some cuts will start to be unwound from October 2024 onwards. Some analysts described the group\\'s complicated decision, agreed on Sunday, as incrementally bearish for oil prices.

With extensive security measures in place, the national capital of Delhi is ready to witness one of the most important electoral battles in recent history. Some exit polls have even suggested the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) might achieve the ambitious \"400 paar\" target set by its leaders during the campaign.\\n\\nLok Sabha Election Results LIVE: After months of fierce campaigning, the nation stands on the brink of finding out the outcome of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections where millions of voters cast their ballot in the world\\'s largest democracy. Results are set to be announced on Tuesday (June 4). The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to come back to power and continue its dominance. Exit polls predicted a clear victory for the saffron party. On the other hand, the INDIA alliance has confidently claimed it will secure over 295 seats.'}, {'article': \"It must be said that seasonal changes in weather influence the number of foreign tourist arrivals in India. Consequently, significant reductions in visitor numbers are observed during the monsoon season. Goa, one of the most happening destinations in the world, is famous for its sunny beaches. Since tourism-related activity is the prime revenue earner for the state, it seems necessary for the government to make all efforts to promote Goa as a 365-day tourist destination. This is why promoting the state as a monsoon tourism destination assumes significance. Goa has a lot to offer visitors during the monsoon season. The springs and waterfalls are in full force, there is greenery everywhere, the beaches are clean and deserted, and river cruises have become even more attractive. Plus, there are attractive off-season discounts as well. This is precisely why more and more tourists are now visiting Goa during the monsoon season. This piece of heaven looks the prettiest when the rain washes the dust away. Like every other coastal region, the monsoon in Goa brings with it drizzling heavy rain and thundershowers. Goa has two wonderful islands, namely Chorao and Divar, that can be explored during the monsoon. The fresh, green, and raw beauty at these sites makes for an experience one just cannot miss. Goa is home to abundant wildlife in its dense tropical forests. So going on wildlife safari tours is something that attracts nature lovers. The Dudhsagar waterfall is a must-visit place for every traveller. This waterfall becomes all the more beautiful during the monsoon, when it literally swells up with excess water. However, swimming in the water is prohibited. The iconic waterfalls are surrounded by dense greenery, which makes for a good trekking trip. This is also the best time to visit spice plantations.\\n\\nThe general elections are over, and the economy is on track for higher growth, which is good news. There is life after this election. We need to bury the hatchet, stop our obsession with who wins and who loses, and focus on the future. Those who take a keen interest in economic growth might have gotten the taste of the growth chart going up. The growth rate is an impressive 8.2% due to a higher than expected increase of 7.8% in the last quarter and that is quite significant. In fact, the expansion is higher than the RBI's earlier forecast of 7%. This is the ninth time since 1961-62 that the economy has recorded 8% growth. Importantly, the growth numbers by themselves failed to get votes unless there was a real increase in the employment rate. The challenge for the next government was to create jobs at a faster rate, along with a faster rate of economic growth. The writing is on the wall and the people expect a lot in the next five years to become the third-highest economy in the next five years. The aim of the government is high, and the stake is very much in our favour.\\n\\nBefore the onset of the monsoon, which is a high transmission season for vector-borne diseases like dengue, the authorities in the government health services in Karnataka must devise a strategy and closely monitor the dengue situation in vulnerable hotspots across the state. Additionally, government teams need to visit locations where cases are reported, inspect for potential breeding sites, and raise awareness among residents about dengue prevention measures. The unit responsible for the National Vector-borne Disease Control Programme should ensure that crucial prevention guidelines are rigorously followed at the household level to effectively eliminate dengue. Local communities must be urged to join the fight against dengue by monitoring and eliminating stagnant water in courtyards and discarded items. Over the past two to three years, Karnataka has seen a steady increase in dengue cases, resulting in deaths.\\n\\nA year after the implementation of the AI (artificial intelligence) camera pilot project at Merces Circle, Panaji, the transport department is set to net a bumper Rs 3 crore in fines after drivers were e-challaned for overspeeding and jumping red lights. The project, which aimed to enhance traffic management and safety through automated surveillance and enforcement mechanisms, saw the Goa traffic police rein in law-breaking motorists to a significant extent. Data indicates a steep drop in overspeeding violations, from 5,300 in June 2023 to 1,900 in May 2024. Similarly, cases of vehicles jumping signals declined from 6,400 last year to 3,100 this year. The AI camera monitoring system is a pilot project, but taking cognizance of the positive results, it should be rolled out across the state. Also, other violations like helmetless riding should be added to the list of detections. Technology used for law enforcement will also ensure that road fatalities, for which Goa has a dubious record, will reduce.\\n\\nInvestors' wealth jumped Rs 12.48 lakh crore, and non-deliverable rupee forwards traded at $83.11 in morning trade on Monday as the benchmark equity index Sensex hit its lifetime high after exit polls, which only served to sow more confusion in the minds of the electorate. It is worth remembering that such predictions are off the mark a lot of times, particularly who forgets 'Shinning India' of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime? (Do we really need them?) pointed to a third term and a sizable mandate for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom investors hope will spend on infrastructure and manufacturing to keep economic growth going. The counting of votes for the Lok Sabha elections, which took place in seven phases, will take place on June 4. Investors should be prepared for fluctuations but can remain optimistic about a potential rally if the final results align with the exit polls. Though I have doubts in mind, even then, it could lead to a significant surge in the stock prices of companies dubbed 'Modi stocks.' However, the final outcome, if in line with exit polls, would likely calm investor nerves, as political and policy continuity will be good for risk assets in the immediate run and macro stability in the medium term.\"}]\n"

डेवलपमेंट इंक्लूसिव अलायंस की जीत, देश और जनता की जीत होगी. यादव ने कहा कि हम और आप (मीडिया) लोकतंत्र को मजबूत करने के लिए लोगों के बीच थे. हम सभी ने देखा है कि भाजपा की रैलियों में लोग नहीं थे, उनके टेंट खाली थे. उनके पक्ष में कुछ भी नहीं था. एग्जिट पोल पर सवाल उठाते हुए उन्होंने कहा कि एग्जिट पोल करने वाली कई एजेंसियां वही हैं जो भाजपा के लिए बूथ प्रबंधन का काम करती थीं.\\n\\n... तो मैं अपना सिर

18 जुलाई 2023 को दो दर्जन से ऊपर पार्टियों के साथ मिलकर इंडिया ब्लॉक बनाया. इसके बाद गठबंधन दलों ने पूरे जोर शोर से चुनाव की तैयारी करनी शुरू की, लेकर धीरे-धीरे जोश हल्का पड़ता रहा. यही वजह रही कि

      "[{'article': 'In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Uttar Pradesh became a political thriller with Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav challenging the BJP, resulting in a reduced seat share for the ruling party. Priyanka Gandhi\\'s intense campaign played a crucial role in Congress\\'s victories in Amethi and Rae Bareli. Her direct and personal approach resonated with voters, particularly women. She also successfully brokered a seat-sharing deal between Congress and the Samajwadi Party. This election marked a significant turnaround for Congress in Uttar Pradesh.Uttar Pradesh has emerged as a gripping political thriller on the day of the Lok Sabha election results in 2024. Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav, the \\'UP ke ladke\\', posed a formidable challenge to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with the INDIA bloc cutting into BJP\\'s seat share. However, the true victor of Uttar Pradesh in this election is a leader whose efforts have finally borne fruit.\\n\\nThe twin power:\\n\\nThe Congress clinched victory in Amethi and Rae Bareli. Rahul Gandhi, who contested from Rae Bareli this time along with Wayanad after Sonia Gandhi moved to Rajya Sabha, won by a huge margin and broke his mother\\'s record.\\n\\nAmethi, which the Congress lost in 2019 after BJP\\'s Smriti Irani defeated Rahul Gandhi, in a surprise result, is also now back with the party. Congress\\'s Amethi candidate Kishori Lal Sharma won the Gandhi family bastion defeating BJP\\'s \\'giant-slayer\\'.\\n\\nCongratulating Sharma, Priyanka Gandhi wrote on X: \"Kishori bhaiya, I never had any doubts, I was sure from the beginning that you would win. Hearty congratulations to you and my dear brothers and sisters of Amethi!\"\\n\\nThe positive outcomes followed an intense campaign led by star campaigner Priyanka Gandhi, who chose not to run in the elections but made every effort to secure votes for the alliance.\\n\\nThe star campaigner in Uttar Pradesh\\n\\nIn one of her addresses to the party workers during the election campaign Priyanka said, \"We have to fight together, with all our strength. Every single one of us has to be ready for the battle ahead.\" She urged party members to work tirelessly and fearlessly to secure victory in the polls and showed the way herself.\\n\\nPriyanka Gandhi Vadra\\'s campaign in Amethi and Rae Bareli showcased her personal approach, boldness, and impromptu style. Her interactions with the public were marked by a sense of connection and empathy. \"I am your sister, your daughter. I have come to understand your issues and find solutions,\" she told a group of women in Amethi.\\n\\nPriyanka\\'s campaign focused on directly engaging with voters, especially women, and addressing their concerns. She visited villages, held small meetings, and participated in door-to-door canvassing. Her spontaneity was evident when she joined young girls performing a folk dance at a village in Rae Bareli, breaking into an impromptu jig herself.\\n\\nPriyanka\\'s campaign style was a departure from the traditional, stage-managed rallies often seen in Indian politics. Her approach was more personal, direct, and spontaneous, which resonated with the local population and is now translating into Lok Sabha wins.\\n\\nThe one who brought \\'UP ke ladke\\' together\\n\\nAfter the 2017 assembly election setback, a new alliance between Congress and the Samajwadi Party seemed unlikely. However, they finally agreed on seat sharing, thanks to Priyanka Gandhi, who broke the deadlock.\\n\\nWhile announcing the seat-sharing details in February, Congress UP incharge Avinash Pande made a special mention of Priyanka\\'s role in reaching a consensus. It was Priyanka Gandhi who dialled up Akhilesh Yadav to iron out differences between the two parties. The call helped not just seal the deal but also ensured that Congress got a fair deal in the form of some important seats that it wanted, the sources added.\\n\\nIn 2017 last assembly elections, the Congress could win just one seat. This, even though Priyanka Gandhi led the party campaign. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections also, the party could win only the Rae Bareli seat which is represented by Sonia Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi\\'s defeat at the hands of BJP\\'s Smriti Irani in Congress bastion of Amethi represented a new low in Congress\\'s electoral performance in the state.\\n\\nBut the 2024 Lok Sabha election results now portray a different story altogether.\\n\\n(With TOI inputs)'}, {'article': \"Jofra Archer's Tweet Resurfaces As BJP Fails To Go '400 Par' In Lok Sabha Election Result 2024: When on song, Jofra Archer, the England speedster, is among the most lethal fast bowlers in world cricket. While he hasn't been able to be on the field as often as he and the Three Lions would have liked, owing to injury and fitness concerns, Archer is also known for his tweets which somehow find their way to be relevant, years after they had been posted by the pacer\\n\\nAnd now as the Results of the Lok Sabha Election 2024 was declared on Tuesday (June 4), one of Archer's old tweet has resurfaced. Notably, the ruling party in India- Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)'s entire campaign for the elections revolved around the 'Abki Baar 400 Paar' Mantra which clearly showed their aim of going past 400 seats in the General Elections.\\n\\nREAD HERE | From Highest First Time Voters To Biggest Victory Margin -- A List Of Records Set In Lok Sabha Election 2024\\n\\nHowever, with the BJP-led National Democartic Alliance (NDA) having to settle with less than 300 seats, Archer's old tweet has gone viral and seems to be a dig at the party even though it could be an observation on a cricket match and its score made years ago.\\n\\nALSO READ | From Yusuf Pathan, Kirti Azad To Devendra Jhajharia: How Sporting Personalities Fared In Lok Sabha Election 2024\\n\\nMeanwhile, among members of the cricket fraternity it was Yusuf Pathan and Kirti Azad, who had contested in the Lok Sabha Elections.

Both emerged victorious, with Pathan beating Congress' Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Azad winning over BJP'sDilip Ghosh.\"}, {'article': 'Pithapuram, the seat from where Kalyan chose to fight the assembly election, had become the most keenly watched contest in Andhra Pradesh.\\n\\nP.K. had lost both the Gajuwaka and Bhimavaram assembly constituencies to the YSRCP in the 2019 polls, which he had contested in an alliance with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India and the Bahujan Samaj Party, leaving lakhs of fans and admirers of the hugely popular Telugu film star turned politician, especially among the youth, heartbroken.\\n\\nTaking no chances in this election, Kalyan had allied with TDP and BJP -- the winning combination of the 2014 polls. Kalyan formed the JSP in 2014, but the fledgling party did not contest the polls then, even though Kalyan campaigned extensively for the TDP-BJP.\\n\\nFor the 2024 elections, Kalyan, going against the expectations of his party workers in these elections, settled for 21 assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats as the share of the JSP in the tripartite alliance to accommodate the BJP.\\n\\nKalyan started his political career in the short-lived Praja Rajyam Party (PRP) formed by his elder brother, K. Chiranjeevi, but left when the PRP merged with the Congress in 2011 and founded the JSP three years later.\\n\\nKalyan\\'s Pithapuram selection, according to analysts, is calculated and deliberate as the assembly seat has a significant number of Kapus, whose community Kalyan hails from.\\n\\nPithapuram, 15 km from the port town Kakinada, is located in the lush Godavari region and is known for its serene green landscapes, temples, etc. According to reports, the most heavily wagered-on result in the state was that of Pithapuram, after the discrete betting of crores of rupees on which party or combine would come to power in the state.\\n\\nIn addition to the caste factor, hundreds of Kalyan\\'s fans -- daily wage labourers from nearby towns and villages to Telugu techies from abroad -- descended on the quiet town of Pithapuram, weeks ahead of the 13 May polls. They silently but actively campaigned for Kalyan, galvanising electoral support for their beloved leader.\\n\\nKalyan, however, faced a formidable rival in YSRCP candidate Geetha. A seasoned politician, Geetha, who started her political journey in the TDP, was elected the Pithapuram MLA in 2009 from Chiranjeevi\\'s PRP. At the time, Kalyan actively supported Geetha as part of the PRP campaign.\\n\\nGeetha was a TDP Rajya Sabha MP from 2000 to 2006 before she joined the PRP and then the Congress when the PRP merged with the national party. She joined the YSRCP before the 2019 polls and won the Lok Sabha elections from Kakinada seat, which includes the Pithapuram assembly segment.\\n\\nUnperturbed by the presence of the hugely popular Kalyan, Geetha went about her campaign by assuring voters of her services as a locally available leader and reminding them about her contributions, such as developing affordable housing, modernising the Yeluru canal and bringing the Industrial Training Institute, polytechnic, and hotel management institutes to Pithapuram. Geetha also banked on the welfare programmes of the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led government -- pension, Amma Vodi, and Cheyutha, among other such schemes for women -- to gather support.\\n\\nWhile Kalyan connected directly with the Pithapuram electorate through his addresses at rallies and road shows, the film star also received the backing of the film fraternity, especially his family. Elder brother and former Union minister Chiranjeevi, who has taken a break from politics, released a short video on social media, appealing for public support for Kalyan. Chiranjeevi\\'s son Ram Charan of RRR (2022) fame, nephew Sai Durgha Tej, and other prominent actors such as Ghanta Nani and Teja Sajja of Hanu-Man (2024) fame also extended their support to the \"power star\" in the Telugu film industry.\\n\\nOn 13 May, Pithapuram, with 236,409 registered voters, recorded an 86.63 voting percentage, according to the ECI.'}, {'article': 'New Delhi [India], June 4 (ANI): Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma on Tuesday congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the victory registered from Varanasi in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and said that his win was \"historic.\"\\n\\n\"Heartiest congratulations to the architect of \\'Ek Bharat-Shrestha Bharat\\', \\'Charioteer of Amritkaal\\' of New India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on achieving a historic victory from Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency, the confluence of India\\'s spiritual and cultural heritage,\" said CM Sharma.\\n\\n\"This massive victory is a symbol of the unwavering faith of the people of Kashi, the city of Devadhishdev Mahadev,\" said the Chief Minister.\\n\\nPraising PM Modi, he said the win is due to the PM\\'s guidance and leadership, public welfare vision and policies, and \\'Modi ki Guarantee\\' dedicated to public welfare.\\n\\nTaking to X, he said, \"With the blessings of Lord Mahadev, under PM Modi\\'s energetic leadership, may the foundation of \\'Developed India\\' be strengthened and may India continue to move on the path of rapid development.

But the bruised party is still set to form the next government with support from its allies in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), including the Janata Dal (United), or JDU, and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). The NDA\\'s tally stood at 291 (including leads) at the time of going to press.\\n\\nThe opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), meanwhile, has done unexpectedly well, belying just about every exit poll prediction. The alliance is winning in 233 seats (including leads), with the Congress party, which had struggled to cross the 50 mark in the previous two elections, in the vanguard and within kissing distance of the 100 mark.\\n\\nWhile the performance by the Congress was creditable relative to the last two elections, the real show stealers in the INDIA bloc were regional parties Samajwadi Party, Trinamool Congress and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which along with smaller contributions from Uddhav Thackeray\\'s Shiv Sena and Sharad Pawar\\'s NCP bagged more than a hundred seats, and propelled the alliance\\'s total to 233. It may not form the government but after a decade, the country is likely to have a strong opposition, provided the alliance holds and there are no defections.\\n\\nIn Uttar Pradesh, which sends the most MPs -- 80 -- to the Lok Sabha, the Samajwadi Party turned the tables on the BJP, with the alliance winning 43 of the 80 seats (including leads). In 2019, the NDA had won 64 seats in the state. In Maharashtra, which has the next highest number of MPs -- the Congress, NCP and Uddhav Thackeray\\'s Shiv Sena took 29 seats (including leads) -- the NDA had won 41 seats in 2019. In Bengal, where national partners Congress, the Left and the Trinamool Congress fought each other, Mamata Banerjee\\'s party increased its seat count by seven to 29 (including leads). In Tamil Nadu, the alliance was leading in all the 39 seats (including leads) with the DMK at the forefront again.\\n\\nWhile the political chaos in Maharashtra meant the elections would be unpredictable, it is Uttar Pradesh, at the heart of the BJP\\'s big Ram Mandir pitch, that has thrown up the biggest surprise. The Ram Mandir was not the primary election issue, as the BJP had hoped it would be, and as Mint had reported last month. Indeed, most voters across states, and more specifically Uttar Pradesh, did not cite the Ram Mandir as an election issue. The BJP\\'s overreliance on what it believed to be its trump card clearly has not paid off.\\n\\nIn the end, the unkindest cut for the BJP came from Ayodhya. The saffron party lost to the SP in the Faizabad seat, of which Ayodhya is a part. This is despite building the Ram temple, an airport, a railway station and an expressway; despite the temple corridor, five-star hotels and the influx of tourists and the money they brought along; and despite the Yogi Adityanath government\\'s focus on law and order and a slew of welfare schemes both from the Centre and the state. What happened in the constituency mirrored the disaffection for the BJP across the state.\\n\\nIn a sense, 2024 has turned out to be more like a traditional Indian election, where constituencies and local factors matter as much as national narratives, unlike in 2014 and 2019, when the only question was if Narendra Modi should be prime minister.\\n\\nThere are four big takeaways for the BJP this election.\\n\\nOne, Prime Minister Modi\\'s brand is no longer enough to win elections on its own. Modi\\'s popularity had peaked in 2019 in several states and to that extent, it seems to have plateaued. Nevertheless, the BJP is gaining fresh ground in states such as Telangana and Odisha, where the PM\\'s popularity is on the uptick, but not enough to offset losses in key states.\\n\\nTwo, the state leadership is equally important. Besides Gujarat, which is a Modi-Amit Shah bastion, the one state that has kept the BJP in good stead is Madhya Pradesh, where the party swept all the 29 seats. Former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan\\'s massive popularity and his government\\'s welfare delivery seem to have given the BJP a big fillip there, as was evident on the ground, with voters across the board pledging their support for \\'Mamaji\\', as Chouhan is fondly known. This factor was evidently missing in other heartland states such as Haryana and Rajasthan, where the BJP had done tremendously well in 2019 but has suffered serious reverses in this election, due to a diminished state leadership.\\n\\nThree, the Centre\\'s welfare plank is a solid one, but weakens when there is an opposition party in the state that can sing the same song. In West Bengal, for instance, chief minister Mamata Banerjee\\'s own welfare delivery is strong enough to overshadow the Centre\\'s. Voters, especially women, cite her popular schemes such as Lakshmir Bhandar, more than Modi\\'s initiatives. The BJP had hoped to improve on its solid performance in West Bengal in 2019 but ended up losing seats.\\n\\nAnd four, a united Opposition can pose a far greater challenge by making gains in each state, even in the absence of an overarching national narrative, as happened in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.\\n\\n\"I think the verdict clearly sets out a message for course correction. The BJP will be in government but will need to be more accommodative in dealing with the Opposition while the Opposition can no longer complain about being voiceless,\" said Chandrachur Singh, professor of political science at Delhi University\\'s Hindu College. \"The verdict can be read as one that is full of mixed bags for all. For the NDA, it offers power but cautions them on future prospects, while for the Opposition it gives them a little now but perhaps brightens their prospects if they play the constructive role required of a responsible opposition.\"\\n\\nNilanjan Mukhopadhyay, veteran journalist and author, Narendra Modi: The Man, the Times, felt that the prime minister will have to become more accommodating with his NDA partners henceforth. \"Going forward, for the survival of his government, Modi has to demonstrate skills in taking others along and forge a consensus. He will have to restart parliamentary processes like referring to Standing Committees, which were almost totally discontinued,\" said Mukhopadhyay.\\n\\nThe big headline of this election is undoubtedly Uttar Pradesh. The BJP had everything going for it in the state, from a popular chief minister with a law and order record to boast of to the Ram Mandir, a decimated Opposition and a formidable win in the 2022 assembly election.\\n\\nWhat seems to have worked against the BJP is its over-reliance on the Ram Mandir issue, as well as a lack of vacancies in government jobs, the paper leak scandal, inflation and the Agniveer scheme.\\n\\nThe caste configuration of constituencies and Samajwadi Party\\'s tactic of fielding only five candidates from the Yadav community worked in its favour, helping it secure votes beyond its core Yadav-Muslim vote bank. It made inroads into the non-Yadav OBC vote and shifted a significant chunk of the Scheduled Caste vote towards itself. Both these are vote banks that the BJP has relied on significantly.\\n\\nThe Congress-SP alliance also helped prevent a split in the Muslim vote, which almost en masse seems to have gone to the alliance.\\n\\n\"Economic issues, too, have played a major role in this verdict and PM Narendra Modi failed to construct an overarching narrative. The opposition strategy, in UP particularly, was very effective. This is Modi\\'s biggest electorally humbling moment,\" said Mukhopadhyay.\\n\\nMaharashtra, meanwhile, is more a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. \"Yahan sab khichdi bani huyi hai,\" was a common lament among voters and that seems to have been reflected in the outcome as well. Ultimately, the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena and Sharad Pawar NCP outdid their rival factions. Uddhav was seen as the rightful heir of the Shiv Sena legacy, while the Pawar patriarch clearly had voter sympathy for what they perceived as a \\'betrayal\\' by his nephew and NDA ally Ajit Pawar.\\n\\nAs expected, every political party touted its welfare schemes during campaigning. For the NDA, \\'Suvidha\\' was the buzzword this election too and is perhaps the plank that helped the BJP emerge as the single largest party, thanks to schemes offering rural houses, free rations, water, subsidized gas and cash payouts through PM Kisan Nidhi.\\n\\nBut unlike in 2019 when welfare gave the BJP the push to the 303 mark, 2024 was different for two reasons. One, several of these central schemes are not new, with voters having already rewarded the BJP for these in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls as well as several state elections. Voters now view these schemes as a given and not with the enthusiasm of 2019. It is in states where the BJP\\'s state governments have a solid welfare record to show that the BJP is benefiting from the double-engine model. Madhya Pradesh and Assam are instant examples, with voters in these states citing state government schemes such as Ladli Laxmi and Orunodoi more than the Modi government initiatives. The NDA won 10 of the 14 seats in Assam (including leads).\\n\\nSecondly, that welfare is a key poll plank is now clear to all political parties and they are mastering the art of selling their programmes to the electorate, giving the BJP tough competition.\\n\\nAnother factor that has been a mixed bag for the BJP is its \\'There is no alternative\\' (TINA) pitch. Some voters did indeed vote for the party as they felt the absence of a national alternative. The perceived absence of a pan-India alternative to Modi meant INDIA failed to emerge as the single largest bloc.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is bad news for the BJP that the TINA factor was discussed at all in this election. In 2019, it was hardly a factor, with the vote for BJP primarily a euphoric vote for Modi. The 2024 election, however, saw several voters looking for something more.\\n\\n\"Now we have seen Modi for 10 years and while his work has been good, one perhaps wouldn\\'t mind trying out a new prime minister. Today, there is no PM candidate on the other side, hence we are supporting Modi. But tomorrow, if a candidate emerges, it will not be easy for the BJP. Boredom does set in,\" said Kuldeep Singh of Sehore in Madhya Pradesh, summing up the thinking of some voters in the 2024 Lok Sabha poll.'}, {'article': \"Ghatal Lok Sabha Election Results 2024: Trinamool Congress candidate Deepak Adhikary defeated BJP candidate Hiranmoy Chattopadhyay with over 1.8 lakh votes in the the Lok Sabha Election.
